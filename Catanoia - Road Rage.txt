If all you've got to do today is find peace of mind
Come round
You can take a piece of mine
And if all you've got to do today is hesitate
Come here, you can leave it late with me

You could be taking it easy on yourself
You should be making it easy on yourself

Cos you and i know, its all over the front page
You give me road rage
Racing through the best days

It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy
Thinking you may be losing your mind

If all you've got to prove today is your innocence.
Calm down, you're as guilty as can be
If all you've got to lose alludes to yesterday.
Yesterday's through.
Now do anything you please

Repeat chorus

Space age, road rage, fast lane, minimum wage
Home late, upgrade, short-changed, golden age
Front page, lose face, handmade, space ache
Backstage, outraged, disgraced, maximum weight
