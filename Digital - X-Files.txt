Send "Coming Back" Ringtone to your Cell I believe in love 
One day you went away 
â€˜Cause there were no more reasons to stay 
You just opened up the door 
oh baby and walked out of my life 
One day you'll come to me 
To say you never stopped loving me 
I will insist but I know 
All I want is you now 
Coming back coming back 
Coming back into my arms baby 
Coming back coming back 
Coming back into my heart 
(repeat) 
One day you walked away 
Cause there were no more reasons to stay 
['m trying to forget the past 
But I can't it's too hard for me now 
One day you'll come to me 
To say you never stopped loving me 
You will insist and you know 
I will not say no 
Coming back coming back 
Coming back into my arms baby 
Coming back coming back 
Coming back into my heart
