Send "No Turning Back" Ringtone to your Cell All the failures I had, all the things that I regret.
Dirty deeds that I have to forget
No turning back.
Now my choices I have made
Standing tall, I will not be afraid.

Those things I left behind
Like the dust swept by the wind.
Could I stand with no fear?
Even though it might be hard.

Life is a game you can always play until you die.
I won't give up, I'll carry on and fight.
Like a lightning that strikes to shine on the darkest night,
Believe in my faith, survive the deepest dark.

Here I find myself walking down this lonely street.
My regrets are now all gone, no more despair.
I think that now I'm freed, I finally see the end.

Those things I left behind
Like the dust swept by the wind.
Could I stand with no fear?
Even though it might be hard.

Life is a game you can always play until you die.
I won't give up, I'll carry on and fight.
Like a lightning that strikes to shine on the darkest night,
Believe in my faith, survive the deepest dark.
