You just walk in, I make you smile,
It's cool but you don't even know me,
You take an inch, I run a mile,
Can't win you're always right behind me.
And we know that you could go and find some other,
Take or leave it or just don't even bother.
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase,
or will this be around forever.

Don't you know it's going too fast,
Racing so hard you know it won't last.
Don't you know, what can't you see,
Slow it down,
read the signs so you know just where you're going.

Stop right now, thank you very much,
I need somebody with the human touch,
Hey you always on the run,
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun,

Do do ... always be together,
Ba da ... stay that way forever.

And we know that you could go and find some other,
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other.
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown,
You're crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around.

Don't you know it's going too fast,
racing so hard you know it won't last,
Don't you know, what can't you see,
Slow it down,
read the signs so you know just where you're going.

Stop right now, thank you very much,
I need somebody with the human touch,
Hey you always on the run,
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun.

Gotta keep it down honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money,
Don't be wasting my time,
You need less speed, get off my case,
You gotta slow it down baby, just get out of my face.

Stop right now, thank you very much,
I need somebody with the human touch,
Hey you always on the run,
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun.

Stop right now, thank you very much,
I need somebody with the human touch,
Hey you always on the run,
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun.

Stop right now, (Stop right now) thank you very much,
(We wanna thank you)
I need somebody with (wanna thank you) the human touch,
(Stop right now)
Hey you always on the run,
Gotta (Thank you very much) slow it down baby,
gotta have some fun (thank you very much).
