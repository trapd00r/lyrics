You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no

So you took a chance
And made other plans
But you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say, oh why you did,
I already know, I found out about him
And Babe there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
And don't it make you sad 

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
You tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone
Boy I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other girl
Oh now your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry, 

cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

You know how they say
That somethings are better left unsaid
But it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
All of these things people tell me
Keep messing with my head
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

You don't have to say, oh why you did,
I already know, I found out from him
Baby there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
And don't it make you sad 

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
You tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone
Boy I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other girl

Oh now your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry, 

cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

Oh

Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er

Cry me, cry me
Oh Cry me, cry me)
Cry me, cry me
Cry me, cry me

Oh and doll
Cry me a river, oh
Cry me a river
Cry me a river, oh
Cry me a river
