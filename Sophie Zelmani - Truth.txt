I don't wanna find out the truth
I don't wanna find out the truth,
but only truth satisfy
I want it so much to go away
I want it so much to go away,
but with the truth it will stay

You will fall heavy upon my chest, 
but laughing will give them time to rest
I still can breath when you are asleep,
just let me grasp for peace

I like to have other things on my mind
I like to have other things on my mind,
I can't choose a line
I wanna wake up and find you
I wanna wake up and find you,
if it's true i won't continue to

You will fall heavy upon my chest, 
but laughing will give them time to rest
I still can breath when you are asleep,
just let me grasp for a little peace
I still can hope like we get along,
truth will stay too long

I don't know how to get armed
I don't know how to get armed,
truth is hard to charm
So hard to charm
