sun is shining, the weather is sweet
make you want to move your dancing feet
to the rescue, here i am
want you to know, y'all, where i stand

(Monday morning) here i am
want you to know just if you can
(Tuesday evening) where i stand
(Wednesday morning)
tell myself a new day is rising
(Thursday evening) get on the rise
a new day is dawning
(Friday morning) here i am
(Saturday evening) want you to know just
want you to know just where i stand

when the morning gathers the rainbow
want you to know i'm a rainbow too
so, to the rescue here i am
want you to know just if you can
where i stand, know, know, know, know, know

we'll lift our heads and give Jah praises
we'll lift our heads and give Jah praises, yeah

sun is shining, the weather is sweet
make you want to move your dancing feet
to the rescue, here i am
want you to know just if you can
where i stand

(Wednesday morning)
tell myself a new day is rising
(Thursday evening) get on the rise
a new day is dawning
(Friday morning) here i am
(Saturday evening) want you to know just
want you to know just where i stand

when the morning gathers the rainbow
want you to know I'm a rainbow too
so to the rescue, here i am
want you to know just if you can
where i stand, know, know, know, know, know

we'll lift our heads and give Jah praises (repeat)
sun is shining, the weather is sweet
make you want to move your dancing feet
to the rescue, here i am
want you to know just if you can
where i stand, no, no, no, no, where i stand
sun is shining, sun is shining
