My mind's featherweight
A rush, sort of, a crush, sort of,
The musk smelling from my neck and blood
Had injected love,
Accidentally bugged over a higher form
Like a, rather gently, drug.
Lids heavyweight.
Infact, the weight of a tractor.
Soaked in aqua
Battered from blue vodka
Call not a doctor but a partner you feel
You find it harder to deal with?
Then visit the hill
That's where i meditate
In a certain room in the villa
The womb that keeps producing
Had me natrually iller
Then i accelerate
Hand on the clutch
I'm planning to touch
A planet or two
I feel better with you

Ref:
Featherweight i get caught up still on her â€“ feather weight
Let's levitate and get caught up still on her featherweight

Starting to radiate
The lack the absence
You're smelling the insence
For instance
And lack of action
My brain aint here
My thoughts aint clear
The least violently
Got lifted while physically drifting
Start to elevate when thinking of you
I got thinking to do
I'm stuck in the rush
Still the crush's
Still feeling like illegal pills
Time to levitate
Only my body stays put
And my minds stays hooked
And my heart keeps ducking
Like the 808 you're feeling
The threshold operate
The next mode offers a treat;
to feel proper

Let's levitate and get caught up still on her featherweight

My minds featherweight
A crush sort of a list
A natrually floating above type of rush
A love of such substantially
Strong form of character i can't focus
My eyelids are heavyweight
Infact i fainted away for a second or two
I feel willing to play bless you
And your lustful way of weaken me
I'll sex you the featherweight made me rise above statues
I meditate in a certain room in the villa
The womb that keeps producing had me natrually iller
Then i accelerate with my hand on the clutch
To touch a planet or two or more i feel better than before...
