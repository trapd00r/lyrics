A trust betrayed a rusty blade
Standing on edge
I walked a line, paid my fine
Hope I know the ledge
Actual facts, unnatural acts
Sins they take their toll
The angel and the jinn and the beast within
The fight to take control

CHORUS:
Lord, have mercy on my soul
On my soul
On my soul
On my soul

Lord, I need ya like a junkie needs his drugs
Need ya like a baby boy needs his hugs
Need ya like a flower needs the sun
I need you like D. M. C needs Run

CHORUS

Love you like a Eskimos love the cold
Love you like a miner man love his gold
Love you like a fisherman love the sea
Love you like the flowers love the work bees

CHORUS

Standing up tall on top of the wall
Hoping I can fly
Angel and the jinn and the beast within' say I'm gonna die

CHORUS
