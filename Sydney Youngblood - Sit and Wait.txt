Send "Sit And Wait" Ringtone to your Cell A year has come, a year has gone 
Still hanging tough, the blues is going on 
Fingers walk the edge of time 
My heart is burning, I'm ready to fly but 

All we can do is sit and wait 
All we can do is just sit and wait (they say) 
All we can do is sit and wait 
All we can do, yeah, that's what they say 
Sit and wait, sit and wait, just sit and wait 

I could run away and touch the sun 
Where there's a spark could be a fire 
Impossible dreams and promises 
Still I ain't nothing, I ain't nowhere 

All we can do is sit and wait 
All we can do is just sit and wait (they say) 
All we can do is sit and wait 
All we can do, yeah, that's what they say 
(Sit and wait) all we can do (sit and wait) is sit and wait 
(Sit and wait) all we can do (sit and wait) 
Is just sit and wait (they say) 
All we can do is sit and wait 
All we can do, yeah, that's what they say 
Sit and wait, sit and wait, just sit and wait 

Ooh ooh ooh 
Oh, they make me wait 

Mmm, all we can do is sit and wait 
All we can do is just sit and wait (they say) 
All we can do is sit and wait 
All we can do, yeah, that's what they say 
Sit and wait, sit and wait, just sit and wait 

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh, hey hey, they make me sit and wait, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Ooh ooh 
Oh, you make me wait (oh oh) 
Oh oh
