You Won The Lottery 
The First Prize Death 
And When We Came Though 
Make Sure Quiet Is Kept 
Hit The Deck Only You 
Where The Fuck Is The Rest? 
I Got A High Caliber Output
Put A Hole In Your Chest 
You Sort A Get Stressed 
Leave You In A State Of Arrest 
Sound System That I'm Rippin' 
Is My Way To Protest 
'Cause The Last One Alive 
To Keep My Eye On The Quest 
Keep My P.M.A. Together 
And From Jah 
I Stay Blessed 
Biddy Bye Bye

A La De De Da De De Da De Da 
We The I.N.S. Terrorists 
Anarchist Tribe High 
We Gonna Eat You Alive 
Because You're Caught In The Sipher 
In Full Overdrive 
Rock The Microphone 
Yeah Like It Was A Religion 
Crew Is Locked And Loaded 
Calibrated With Percision 
Send Out The Drunk Munk 
With All The Ammunition 
Followed By The Stoner Punk 
To Kill The Competition

'Cause If It's All For love 
For Real For Real 
No Caps Get Peeled 
You Recognize That 
You Trapped In A Raw Deal 
It's All For Real 
My Crew Broke The Seal 
I Feel How I Feel 
'Cause When Nice I Like To Get Ill 
No Guts Spill At Last No One Stands Still 
Pack A MicNot A Nickleplate 
And No Steal 
It's Got To Be 
Ought To Be 
Sort Of Naughty 
Wanna Be 
Probably What They Thought Of Me 
And Shot At Me 
Not Naughtily 
What?
