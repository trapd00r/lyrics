Send "Trapped (original mix)" Ringtone to your Cell Should I listen what you say
Or listen what your folks say?
It's a tough decision to make

I don't really wanna lose you
But I don't want your folks to
Turn me over to the hands of the law

I guess they think that I'm not good enough for you
I can tell the way they act and their attitudes
As the tears roll from my eyes I feel the hurt inside
As I reach out to you saying I'm so confused

Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh

If you love one another
Why should you let this go further?
Can't you see it's gonna pull us apart

If you think I can't afford to
Support you if you want to
Ever think about ever settlin' down

I guess they think that I'm not good enough for you
I can tell the way they act and their attitudes
As the tears roll from my eyes I feel the hurt inside
As I reach out to you saying I'm so confused

Oh, Oh I'm trapped
Like a fool I'm in a cage
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped

Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped

Like a fool I'm in a cage
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped

Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out!

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh

(Can't you see I'm so trapped
And I don't know what to do
Can't you see I'm so trapped
So in love with you)

See I'm trapped
And I'm so confused

I'm like a man in a cage
And I'm so in love with you

As the tears roll from my eyes I feel the hurt inside
As I reach out to you saying I'm so confused

Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh...
