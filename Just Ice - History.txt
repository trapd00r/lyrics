Send "Justice not politics" Ringtone to your Cell Newspapers, Magazines, Jobs galore
Middle class students, oh what a bore
Designer labels trendy post codes
Putting Charlie up your nose
Brand new cars take a look
Paid by daddy's big cheque book
Your rebellion stands at the back of the club
Inking down notes with the bands blood
WE WANT JUSTICE NOT POLITICS
WE WANT JUSTICE NOT POLITICS
WE WANT JUSTICE NOT POLITICS
WE WANT JUSTICE NOT POLITICS
LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE YOU TURN TAIL AND RUN
WHAT YOU ONCE BELIEVED IN NOW YOU TAKE THE PISS
BY WORD OF MOUTH AND NEGATIVE PRESS
What goes through your mind is a mystery
You watch street bands kickin in history
We're having a say your having a go
You're the first to spot a row at a punk show
Dancing and music's about having fun
