I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la

I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

Every night, every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay, won't you lay
Stay forever and ever and ever

La, la, la, la, la

I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in you're heart
Set me free, feel the need in me
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you outta my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

How does it feel?
