I found the love but it didn't last
wonderful days belong to the past
I don't know where I stand, what I'm to do
I try to forget and to find someone new

So I pray on my knees to heaven above
Send me somebody please, someone to love
Led them into my story, give me your hand
Don't let me down, 'cause I'm hard to demand
