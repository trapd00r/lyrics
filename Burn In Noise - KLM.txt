Just arrived by K.L.M.
Left the airport in the heat
In the bus strange people meet
Driving through the starless night
Passing very unusual sights

Left the bus at five to five
Caught a taxi started to drive
He thought I was a millionaire
And accordingly put up the fare
Dawn was breaking in the east
Causing this hot night to cease

Mosquitos buzzing in my ears
Grating sound of clashing gears
Burning rubber filled the air
Taxi driver began to swear
The heat was burning my head was turning
It was then the car broke down
Just on the outskirts of town

A camel from the Dhrangadhra
Silently passed by our car
A vulture circled high above in the air
I had to shade my eyes to cover the glare
Sweating in the plastic seats
Hard to breathe in the increasing heat

Lying back my mind started to
Drift into an uneasy sleep
I dreamt I was in New Delhi
Slowly dying of la grippe
