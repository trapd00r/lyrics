Six, seven, eight nine ten
Lou Bega on a trip would all come in
With a little bit of this and a little bit of that
You can get what you see you can see what you get
And I bet that you all a little bit excited
If you want an autograph: "Honey I can write it!"
I got girls worldwide on the planet
Some called Whitney and some called Janet

I gotta girl in Paris I gotta girl in Rome
I even gotta girl in the Vatican Dome
I gotta girl right here I gotta girl right there
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere
I gotta girl on the moon I gotta girl on Mars
I even gotta girl that likes to dance on the stars
I gotta girl right here and one right there
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere

From Miami Beach to Beluga Bay
From the Milky Way to East L.A.
From St.Tropez to my home caf√©
That's my way and I do it like day by day in

Africa - America - Europe and Australia
Asia - Canada - I take 'em all and marry her
India - Arabia - to the girls of Germany
All around the planet you can be my fantasy

I gotta girl in Paris I gotta girl in Rome
I even gotta girl in the Vatican Dome
I gotta girl right here I gotta girl right there
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere
I gotta girl on the moon I gotta girl on mars
I even gotta girl that likes to dance on the stars
I gotta girl right here and one right there
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere

You and me - no matter where you from baby
No matter where you from baby - baby only you and me

I gotta girl in Paris I gotta girl in Rome
I even gotta girl in the Vatican Dome
I gotta girl right here I gotta girl right there
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere
I gott girl on the moon I gott girl on Mars
I even gotta girl that likes to dance on the stars
I gotta girl right here and one right there
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere

I gotta girl in Paris I gotta girl in Rome
I even gotta girl in the Vatican Dome
I gotta girl right here I gotta girl right there
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere

And I gotta girlfriend everywhere
And I gotta girlfriend everywhere
