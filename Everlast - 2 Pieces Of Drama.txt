2 pieces of drama
The hammer's bout' to fall
2 pieces of drama
there's gunplay in the hall
2 pieces of drama
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire
2 pieces of drama
Boy you know not to play with fire

He rocks a big ??? caber
A ping pong table for a ring
He's mentally unstable
To him murder it ain't no thing
He'll do you dirty style
He's holding dirty bile
He's out pumping on the corner
Trying to stay warm
And keep it cool like Miles

He keeps it fundamental
He's got the jeans and the bubblegoose on
There's murder on his mental
He's got the deuce deuce in his palm

And y'all know the fable
How cain did able
Ever since the beginning
The world keeps pinning just like a turntable

La la la la la la la la (B Real Hand on the Pump sample) 

When it's selling out back 
Likes to pump crack 
To the fiends that be getting high 
He keeps his hand on the pump 
He's ready to dump 
On any chump that would even try 
He got a finger on the trigger 
He ain't scared to pull it 
Head full of liquor 
Boy you might catch a bullet 
They're holes in stable 
Drugs on the table 
Everybody's sitting round 
Watching cops on the cable 
Dressed like a slob 
Keeps his hair braided 
He's never been robbed, 
He's only been raided. 
He's never known joy 
The boy is so jaded 
He's never been loved 
He's only been hated
His soul's on ice 
His heart is stone
Just another dead king
Rotting on his throne
With a pain that would
Cut you down to the bone
You're born alone
Boy you die alone
