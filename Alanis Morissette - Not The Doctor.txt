I don't want to be the filler if the void is solely yours 
I don't want to be your glass of single malt whiskey hidden in the bottom drawer 
I don't want to be a bandage if the wound is not mine 
Lend me some fresh air 

I don't want to be adored for what I merely represent to you 
I don't want to be your babysitter, you're a very big boy now 
I don't want to be your mother, I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months 
Show me the back door 

Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6 
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh 
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom 
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor

I don't want to be the sweeper of the eggshells that you walk upon 
I don't want to be your other half, I believe that 1 and 1 make 2 
I don't want to be your food or the light from the fridge on your face at midnight 
Hey what are you hungry for 

I don't want to be the glue that holds your pieces together 
I don't want to be your idol, sSee this pedestal is high and I'm afraid of heights 
I don't want to be lived through a vicarious occasion 
Please open the window

Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6 
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh 
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom 
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor

I don't want to live on someday when my motto is last week, and I 
I don't want to be responsible for your fractured heart and its wounded beat 
I don't want to be a substitute for the smoke you've been inhaling 
What do you thank me, what do you thank me for?

Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6 
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh 
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom 
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor
