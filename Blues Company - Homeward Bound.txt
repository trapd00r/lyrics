Send "Homeward Bound Angel" Ringtone to your Cell You never gave me the chance
To say goodbye to you
Somebody called and said you'd left
I don't think I'll be seeing you too soon
Two way running down the road
Do I look like anyone you know
Whatever brought you here
Well it's gonna get you home
You leave no trace to be found
And what's the difference
You here or gone
Memory fades and time steals away
Still the miles won't be forgotten
As the homeward bound angel goes awandering
In this endless solitude
Check'n the sunset for clues
I listen for echoes of your footsteps
In the hotel bars and by the summing pools
Two way running down the road
Do I look like anyone you know
Whatever brought you here
Well it's gonna get you home
You lave no trace to be found
And what's the difference
You here or gone
Memory fades and time steals away
Still the miles won't be forgotten
As the homeward bound angel
Goes awanderin'
I'm gonna go awanderin'...wanderin' on
Here or gone
