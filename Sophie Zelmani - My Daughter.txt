Oh, my lord
Why have you done my kisses blind
 
Why do you end what has just begun
Why don't you give me time
When you know I've got love on my mind
 
And why have you
Made me chary for all
That used to make me fall
 
Why do I feel so terrified
And mostly like a blight
Like I ask for tons of love
 
Oh, my trust
Why don't you help no more
I used to be so sure
 
That if the right one
Would meet my eyes
He would be hypnotized
And love me all along
Through this life
 
Oh, my lord
Let's say no more
I just can't endure
 
So many years has just become
A long long time
When you knew I had love on my mind
