Send "Devil & the Deep Dark Ocean" Ringtone to your Cell A snowy owl above the haunted waters
poet of ancient gods
Cries to tell the neverending story
prophecy of becoming floods

An aura of mystery surrounds her
the lady in brightest white
Soon the incarnate shall be born
The Creator of the night

Deep dark is his Majesty's kingdom
A portent of tomorrow's world
There shall the liquid give Him power
The red-eyed unborn lord

Fatal embrace of the bloodred waters
The cradle of infinite gloom
The spell to master this Earth
Carven on an infant's tomb

"I will die for the love of the mermaid
Her seduction, beauty and scorn
Welcome to the end of your life
- Hail the Oceanborn!"

"Disgraced is my virginity
Death has woven my wedding dress
Oh, Great Blue, breathe the morning dew
For you are the cradle for the image of god"

"Brave now, long rest is sweet
With me here in the deep

"I Prayed for pleasure, wished for love
Prayed for your..."

"Never pray for me!"

"Who the hell are you for me
But a mortal dream to see"

"This apathetic life must drown
Forever just for me"

"Leave me be
Leave me be
Leave me be..ee eeee... e"

"From cradle to coffin
shall my wickedness be your passion

We shall come to set the dolphins free
We shall wash the darkened bloodred sea
Our songs will echo over the mountains and seas
The eternity will begin once again in peace
