Send "New World" Ringtone to your Cell Train whistles, sweet clementine
Blueberries, dancers in line
Cobwebs, a bakery sign

Oooo-sweet clementine
oooo-dancers in line
oooo

If living is seeing
I'm holding my breath
In wonder, I wonder
what happens next?
A new world, a new day to see

I'm softly walking on air
halfway to heaven from here
Sunlight unfolds in my hair

Oooo-Walking on air
Oooo-to heaven from here
oooo

If living is seeing
I'm holding my breath
In wonder, I wonder
what happens next
A new world, a new day to see...
To see...
