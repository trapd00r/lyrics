This one is dedicated to dem heart-broken lovers...

Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China in a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you, What does that mean?
And you said... 

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin' 
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin' 

Reaching out to all dem...
To dem lovers
Who cannot find demselves, you know

You're on the road and now you pray it last 
The road behind was rocky,
But now you're feeling cocky 
You look at me and you see your past 
Is that the reason why you're running so fast?
And you said... 

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin' 
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'

Nothing gonna break my stride, I'm gonna keep on movin'
Ca me na stand still me gonna keep on grovin
While me walk down the street of Revolution
Hear the sound of freedom till I reach Mount Zion
Nobody slow me down, and I won't touch ground
Feel Jah Jah present, an I feel him all around
Good Vibration ina you an me, will bless eveybody ina Community

Never let another guy like you, work me over
Never let another guy like you, drag me under
If I need another guy like you, I will tell him
Never want another guy like you, have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin' (Woman)
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin' (I said)

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'
(Beca me keep on movin',)

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
(Break my stride)
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'

OH OH

AH AH AH
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride 
Nobody`s gonna slow me down, oh no

Got to slow me down, down, down, down, down know
I've got to keep on movin'
Nothing gonna drop me drop me under
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground, oh no

Nothing gonna break my break my stride
I've got to keep on movin'

Dema won't take us down
