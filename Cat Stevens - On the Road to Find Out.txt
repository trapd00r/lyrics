Well, I left my happy home
to see what I could find out.
I left my folk and friends
with the aim to clear my mind out.

Well I hit the rowdy road
and many kinds I met there,
many stories told me
of the way to get there, ooh.

So on and on I go,
the seconds tick the time out,
there's so much left to know,
and I'm on the road to findout, ooh.

Well in the end I'll know, 
but on the way I wonder
through descending snow,
and through the frost and thunder,

I listen to the wind come howl,
telling me I have to hurry.
I listen to the robin's song
saying not to worry, ooh.

So on and on I go,
the seconds tick the time out,
there's so much left to know,
and I'm on the road to findout, ooh.

Then I found myself alone,
hoping someone would miss me.
Thinking about my home,
and the last woman to kiss me, kiss me.

But some times you have to moan
when nothing seems to suit yer,
but nevertheless you know
you've locked the door towards the future, ooh.

So on and on you go,
the seconds tick the time out.
There's so much left to know,
and I'm on the road to findout, ooh.

Then I found my head one day
when I wasn't even trying,
and here I have to say,
'cause there is no use in lying, lying.

Yes the answer lies within,
so why not take a look now,
kick out the devil's sin,
pick up, pick up a good book now, ooh.

Yes the answer lies within,
so why not take a look now
kick out the devil's sin,
and pick up, pick up a good book now, ooh
