What do i got to do to make you love me
What do i got to do to make you care
What do i got to do when lighting strikes me
It will wait to find that your not there

What do i got to do to make you want me
What do i got to do to be heard
And what do i say when its all over babe
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad so sad
It's a sad situation
And its getting more and more and more absurd

It's sad so sad
Why cant we talk it over babe
Whoa it seems to me that 
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad so sad
It's a sad situation
And its getting more and more and more absurd

It's sad so sad
Why cant we talk it over babe
Whoa it seems to me that 
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do i got to do to make you love me
What do i got to do to make you care
And what do i do when lighting strikes me
What do i got to do what do i got to do
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
