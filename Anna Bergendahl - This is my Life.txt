I'd go down the beaten track, along the river with an empty bag
At the end she said to me: "Why are you here with the autumn leaves?"

'Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand
'Cause this is my life, my friend, and I can't be no one else

I'm done, tipping on my toes, strike an iron and attack my soul
Misty moon, you're gonna see, I've got your blues to get on my feet

'Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand
'Cause this is my life, my friend, and I can't be no one else

I don't wanna run; I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna hide; I just wanna stay free, to be me
I don't wanna win; I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna play; I just wanna remember, my name

'Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

('Cause this is my life, my friend, and this is my time to stand)
'Cause this is my life, my friend, and I can't be no one else
'Cause this is my life, my friend, and I can't be no one else
'Cause this is my life, my friend
