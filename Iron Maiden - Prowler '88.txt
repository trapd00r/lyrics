Send "Prowler '88" Ringtone to your Cell Walking through the city, looking oh so
Pretty, Ive just got to find my way.
See the ladies flashing. all there legs
And lashes. Ive just got to find my way.

Well you see me crawling
Through the bushes with it open wide.
What you seeing girl? 
Cant you believe that feeling, cant you believe it,
Cant you believe your eyes? 
Its the real thing girl.

Got me feeling myself and reeling around,
Got me talking but feel like walking around.
Got me feeling myself and reeling a...
Got me talking but nothings with me...
Got me feeling myself and reeling around.
