Send "Maybe Someday" Ringtone to your Cell half the time i don't know if i'm awake or i'm asleep

half the time i don't even care

spend a lifetime looking for the real thing

where's the real thing gone

sulking silent sitting in a corner

tell them i'm not there

like a dream i'm never there for no one

leave a number when you hear the tone

half the time you'll see me staring at the sky

and i don't know why this dream is running dry

maybe someday i'll tear it all down

maybe someday i'll tear it all down

so where are we now i don't know where

and where do we stand

we don't wake up one day when it's all been said

we end up as dirt and dust again

they're throwing stones on my Street

here comes a working week to wear us down

on empty ground

put up a factory or a supermarket when the day is done

they take us all back home

the ghost of promises it lingers on our breath

and all we leave are secrets we can't keep

we don't leave anything or nothing permanent

well never mind all we don't have is time

summer's gone it only stayed a minute

all the rainbows ran

all applaud the lions of september

when the nights get long

maybe someday

maybe someday
