Let's go down now
Into the darkness
Of your thoughts
Hurry up now
We're waiting for
Us to fall
Fall to pieces now (Fall to pieces)
A broken mirror (Fall to pieces)
And your life

The silence in black and white
Falling forward as she walks towards the light

RIGHT NOW
I'm outside of your window with my radio

I sleep with one eye open so I can see you breathing (I sleep with one eye open)
I follow your chest bone (so I can see you breathing)
Until I  
I can see you 
I can hear you 
Breathing...exhale

The silence in black and white

RIGHT NOW
I'm outside of your window with my radio
RIGHT NOW
I'm outside of your window with my radio

NOW 
NOW

I'm outside of your window with my radio (Wishing you could be there)
I'm outside of your window with my radio (Wish you could be there)
I'm outside of your window with my radio (Wishing you could be there)

I'm outside of your window with my radio
You are the only station
You play the song I know
You are the song I know
