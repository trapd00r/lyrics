Send "Dancing With Girls" Ringtone to your Cell You're not to know you're not to know what's set in stone what's set in stone
She says she's fine says she's fine and she likes it she's coming over and changing it all around
She said to say she said to say is that ok is that ok
She says she's fine she says she's fine and she likes it she's coming over and dancing with girls now

Never ever right never ever right I cant stand well
I cant stand the sight I cant stand the sight of you

There'll be no way there'll be no way that this can stay that this can stay
She says she's fine says she's fine and she likes it she's coming over and changing it all around
You said to say you said to say was that ok nothing ever seems that you care boy
Running out of reasons to call she's dancing with girls now

Never ever right never ever right I cant stand well
I cant stand the sight I cant stand the sight of you

And all the while you've been taking all of your sweet time you heart was breaking
And you don't know why it took so long to get here
And after this it wouldn't matter well you couldn't miss
What came after id make a fist but that's as far as it got
I know things are going to change for good
You see these things they seem to work the way they should
Well im holding back id make it if I could
All I can say is she's dancing with girls now

Never ever right never ever right I cant stand well
I cant stand the sight of you
Never ever right never ever right I cant stand well I cant stand the sight
I cant stand the sight of you
