Send "Tornero" Ringtone to your Cell I'm keeping your smile on my mind every day 
I'm feeling your touch on my face, even while you're away 
Like when was together in that dream that could've been so right, hey 
Like when was together in that dream that could've been so right 

Tornero, tornero 
La mia vita ti daro 
Tornerai, tornerai 
Mia per sempre tu sarai 

I wonder what I should feel, so empty these days 
I wonder what I should feel now, while you're away 
We'll dance together in that dream that could've been so right, hey 
We'll dance together in that dream that could've been so right 

Tornero, tornero 
La mia vita ti daro 
Tornerai, tornerai 
Mia per sempre tu sarai 

I'm keeping your smile in my mind 
I'm feeling your touch on my face 
I just really miss you when I want to kiss you 

And I wonder what I didn't know 
And I wonder why, why I didn't know 
And I wonder why I didn't know 

Tornero, tornero 
La mia vita ti daro 
Tornerai, tornerai 
Mia per sempre tu sarai
