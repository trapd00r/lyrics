Send "Bloody Murder" Ringtone to your Cell I'm drowning in hatred
I'm falling down on to my knees in prayer
And I will pray for my lord to kill my enemies
I will sacrifice
I will complicate
I will bring them down onto their knees in shame
And they'll remember my name
I'm so blind I only see what I want to see
So called martyr for God's murder

You're not ready
You're not ready for this genesis of a brave new world
You're not ready
You're not ready for this apocalyptic and cryptic script
I'm spitting bloody murder
Bloody murder
Come on, everybody get your weapons up
And sing bloody murder
Bloody murder
It's the apocalyptic and cryptic script I'm spitting out

All our children bleed and there was never need
I'm so blind I only see what I want to see
Sacrifice
I will complicate
I will bring you down onto your knees in shame
And you'll remember my name
Don't you see?
You only see what you want to see

So called martyr for God's murder

You're not ready
You're not ready for this genesis of a brave new world
You're not ready
You're not ready for this apocalyptic and cryptic script
I'm spitting bloody murder
Bloody murder
Come on, everybody get your weapons up
And sing bloody murder
Bloody murder
It's the apocalyptic and cryptic script I'm spitting out

He's ready to meet his maker now
It doesn't matter how many will die
He can't wait to see those open golden gates
Watch his whole life flash before his eyes
Yeah, he's ready to meet his maker now
It doesn't matter how many will die
But as the bomb blows his body in half-
He reads the writing on the wall for the very first time
It says, "You never mattered"

You never mattered

You're not ready
You're not ready for this genesis of a brave new world
You're not ready
You're not ready for this apocalyptic and cryptic script
I'm spitting bloody murder
Bloody murder
Come on, everybody get your weapons up
And sing bloody murder
Bloody murder
It's the apocalyptic and cryptic script I'm spitting out my mouth
