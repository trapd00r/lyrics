This is the fuckin' shit I be talkin' about
Half rappin' ass mothafuckers
You think it's a game?  You think it's a fuckin' game?
Come on, uh, uh, uh
Come on, uh, uh?  
What'cha really want?
What'cha really want?  
What!
D-M-X!  Uh, uh, uh, uh
Come on!  
Ride or die!
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo
What's my name?  
DMX, and I be the best
You see the rest? 
They lookin' like they need a rest
One more time! 
I'm a spit at you some shit that's gon' get at you 
Be fuckin' with your mind
Stop talkin' shit!
'Cause you out there runnin' your mouth
And really don't know who you fuckin' with
Here we go again!
How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas I have no friends? 
You still actin' up!
Runnin' around here like some brand new pussy that's about to get fucked
The game don't stop!
I'm still gettin' down for whatever
Whenever, that's why my shit is hot
Can't keep it real!
Now, some of us do, but most of us don't 
That's just how a nigga feel
I shed blood! 
For my people; that'll keep you lookin' see-through
Whenever you try to creep through

[Chorus x 2]
D-M-X!
If you want it, we got it
Come and get it, nigga; we wit' it
All you gotta do is set it, baby
Ride or die!
What'cha niggas want?  Uh, uh
What'cha niggas want?

You still playin' games!
You gon' think it's a joke until they no longer remember your name
That's how we do 'em!
Make cowards disappear into thin air by puttin' shit through 'em
Never comin' back!
Last time you saw that nigga is the last time you'll see that nigga
(Alright)
No more deaths!
'Cause in a minute you gonna have grandma bein the only family member left
Bust my gun!
If I gots to kill a nigga, but I'm always down for the one on one
Dog for life!
We gon' get to the bottom of this shit if it takes all night
Stop, drop!
Open up shop 
(What!)
Fake up-north niggas screamin' for the cops
Ride or die!
Now, what that mean is that I tell a nigga bye-bye and pop him in his right eye

[Chorus x 2]

Look at all these off-brand niggas
Runnin' around, yappin' about they be holdin' figgas as big as Jigga's
That's that bullshit!
Don't they know that around me talkin' about what you got will get you hit?
I'm not a nice person!
I mean, I'd smack the shit out you twice, dog, and that's before I start cursin'
I stay flippin'!
One minute I'm cool, the next minute I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
That's my style!
I'm a cruddy nigga; leave you all bloody, nigga
Service with a smile
Suck my dick!
Now all you niggas that's been to jail before know it's about to get thick
Let's get it on, baby!
I'm gonna be goin' against four niggas in one and you think you crazy?
I've lost my mind!
And I'm about to make you lose yours too from far away one time
(Boom!)

[Chorus x 3]

D-M-X!
