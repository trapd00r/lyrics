Know that you will listen
So I have my chance to say
You're waiting
For me somewhere
Though you hide
From me those days

I know that you will listen
To hear if I am still with you
Well
Now you know

Something makes you wonder
What I'm doing here
I wonder the same
Why are you
So far from here

There are different ways of living
Living with you
Maybe this way will do

It's quite strange
For me to talk
To speak to you this way
I can't see your face
When I give my love away

You can only hear
I am still with you

And I might believe that will do
I might believe that will do
