Raisin' hustlers, thieves, and prostitutes
Young homie think before you shoot, murderer-ahh

Where will our children go
When there no (nowhere, no!) place anywhere they can go

Bizzy
And trouble may come and some time
You'll get pulled over by one-time
And when in 1999 rewinds didn't even make any strides

Murder all around the whole world is nauseatin'
Everybody hatin' everybody over-rated
Why everybody actin' agitated
I thought we graduated back in the saddle

Waitin' (board) aboard the battle station
Hation is a birth defect, and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains close, open up the door
No more, no more

Big B.
See we're losing this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
So I'm reachin' high up above
Lord let Your blessings begin

Bizzy &  Big B. 
And let's change the world
And let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)

Flesh
It got me ready to set off the riot
Ridin' with my trues, humbly united gathering souls
Here we go, roll up some more Phillies
My nigga let me hit it, niggas we thuggin' immortalized, let's get high

It's them niggas you most desire
I could remember from way back in the day
Comin' up out of the ghetto was a hell of a struggle, for selling the fiends ya-yo
But it was my dream to kick flows to put my people on another level

Like it'll be for the lust (lust), or could it be for the rush (rush)
My niggas love when they bust (bust), they steady buck and you duck (duck)
They'll put you deep in the dust (dust), my niggas creepin' on ah come up (come up)

Black nigga killa (killa), thuggish ruggish nigga
Nigga pin it, nigga fi'in' to descend into a dawn of a new millennium
Anticipatin', life without Satan
Hatin', and our enemies to hell I'm sendin' 'em

Bizzy &  Big B. 
And let's change the world
And let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)

Layzie
Everyday the devil at me
And I wish the Lord threw a hummer at me, I ain't happy
Me and Eazy-E in a B-E-N-Z
With my niggas right next to me

It's my legacy, we can't let it stop us (uh-uh) not now
The whole world endin' up the buck buck, pow
Corruption, destruction, disaster
Everybody tryin' to rap faster than the master

Oh Lord, could you save my soul
Nigga tryin' to go platinum around 40 years old
The Lord knows, we can do this shit
It ain't no stoppin' us now, 'cause we can prove this shit

Nigga me, Stew, D's P.D., Freaky-G
The whole world wanna be rappin' with me
I'm in the flesh, let's talk, about sex
Babies havin' babies, generation X

With the AIDS epidemic we ain't pure no more
And I know they got a cure for this shit, we ain't rich
First we lost Eazy, then we lost Pac
Biggie got killed, when this shit gonna stop

Everybody wanna know what's goin' on with the Thuggish Ruggish
Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone
Tryin' to be prepared for the Y2K
And if I don't die today

I'm tryin' to change the world

Bizzy &  Big B. 
And let's change the world
And let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)

Wish
You need a message, you could love our rappin'
But they tryin' to ban it, realize it ain't gonna happen
We done changed the world (world), ghetto voices bein' heard and felt
You know it's funny, got my guns better arm yourself

Most don't have a clue if it goes down what to do
Don't you know this government ain't vote for me and you
I have a dream, no I have a wish
If we can't save ourselves, then let's save the kids

Let the world go on (go on)
Let these babies have somethin'
Let the world go on (go on)
Just don't blow this motherfucker up

You kill him, he'll kill you
Some say it's stupid but violence really lives where I come from (come from)
Hungry little kids where I come from (come from)
Thugs like me where I come from (come from, come from, come from)

Big B.
See we losin' this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin' won't end
So I'm reachin' high up above
Lord let Your blessings begin

Bizzy &  Big B. 
And let's change the world
And let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)
Let's change the world
Let's change the world (World)
