Chorus : 

You don't wanna fuck with me today 
'Cause a little some somethin didn't go your way 
So try not to be like that today 
'Cause i'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way (c'mon)

We're only givin' a fuck if you're invading the space 
So getcha getcha get your groove on (gotta getcha groove on)
Don’t keep us waiting too long (Don't keep us waitin' too long)

Fred Durst:

Don't you treat me like a toy kid 
Do you enjoy this? 
Every single second i'm alive, i'm a mess 
Got these laser beam mic checks 
Communicating through the genelec, high tech 
Keep you on the run now 
Don't wanna be that guy 
Every single second i'm alive 
I'm alive, i don't understand why 
I got your trunk full of candy
and your so high bumping off the sweetness 
This is what you need (what you need)
Another little piece of me inside you 
'Cause you know that i'll always keep it true (keep it true)
And that's exactly what i do 
It's what i do, yeah it's what i do

Xzibit: 

I got breakneck delivery 
No time for chivalry 
Extraordinary ability 
Shit longevity 
Dig deep in your soul and find yourself 
'Cause mind control could turn y'all to someone else 
So fast your head'll probably spin the fuck right off 
Me and fred about to go half on microsoft 
Them live earning twenty percent 
Those little half-assed direct hits ain’t even making a dent 
What an event 
Ah hell, Xzibit and Limp 
As we attempt to bring home the championship 
It's all in the risk 
I'll still lead the league and assist 
Give me the fifth 
I'm drinking while i'm taking a piss, bitch 

Chorus:

You don't wanna fuck with me today

Xzibit: 

I got untapped material 
I serial kill shit 
Give me that real shit 
X finish 'em off quick 
Makin' your jaw split when i'm touching the mosh pit 
Constant conflict knockin' faggot's unconscious 
Nauseous 
Raisin' the stakes 
Increasin' the weight 
Got homies that can lay down and lift the plate 
So quit tryin' to invade my space 
Before i call for a face-to-face and got to rest my case 
Like 

Fred Durst: 

This is how we do it 
Just recognize we keep gettin' right to it 
Lookin' into these eyes 
Lookin' into these eyes and you'll see the size of the flames 
Then you might despise the size of my game 
Step the fuck back! 
Xzibit's on the track 
You should have buckled up before your head hit the dash 
You gotta hate that 
A demo from an eight-track 
Brought me to a place 
Where platinum comes in eight stacks,bitch
