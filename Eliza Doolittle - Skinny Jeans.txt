I really don't like your point of view
I know you'll never change
Stinging me with your attitude
I've got the mind to walk away

I really don't like your arrogance
Or your policies
You're ninety-nine percent an embarrassment
Of just wrong qualities

[Chorus:]
I don't mind it when you [whistles]
Brings out the best in me when you [whistles]
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
When you wind up next to me

I like it when you [whistles]
Can I have some please of that [whistles]
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
And you wind up next to me

I really don't like your skinny jeans
So take them off for me
Show me what you've got underneath
So we can do this properly

I really don't like the way you smile
When you think you're right
But I will forgive you, the yoke is in the middle
And we're chewing through the wire

[Chorus]

I dreamt that you were on a train
And you were leaving, you were leaving
You made me think of what I'd miss
Do you believe it, you believe it

I don't mind it when you [whistles]
Brings out the best in me when you [whistles]
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
When you wind up next to me

I like it when you [whistles]
Can I have some please of that
Take off your skinny jeans
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
And you wind up next to me

I dreamed that you were on a train
And you were leaving, you were leaving
