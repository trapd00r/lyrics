I wanna kiss you all over

Gimme that kiss
Gimme that kiss
Gimme that kiss
Gimme that kiss

Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't break it in
I may set you free
Won't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that
You'll be jealous
We can have it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me

Cause you know that all I need everyday
Just to keep my hands off you
(If you, if you)
Felt that y'all need to take a break
She just wanna argue
(If you, if you)
Felt this way
Can't everybody know
It's OK
(If you, if you)
Taste it
I'll make sure you eat every crumb off the plate

(I may think about it
Cause on your eyes are saying
That you wanna undress me)
Bet you wish what I can play
If I was her
I would sleep on you all day
(I will see about it
But then the problem see is
How you and me)
The boy I'm currently seeing is
6 foot 3 and too possessive

Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't break it in
I may set you free
Won't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that
You'll be jealous
We can have it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me

(If you, if you)
Drop the ball
That may change everything I love about you
(If you, if you)
We should
Call this an affair
Like this
Might hurt you
(If you, if you)
(If you, if you)

(I may think about it
Cause on your eyes are saying
That you wanna undress me)
(I will see about it
But then the problem see is
How you and me)

Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't break it in
I may set you free
Won't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that
You'll be jealous
We can have it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me

Bet you if I kiss you all over
You won't break it in
I may set you free
Won't stop when you're kissing me
Bet you if I kiss you all over
You can tell that
You'll be jealous
We can have it
Nothing's wrong with kissing me?
