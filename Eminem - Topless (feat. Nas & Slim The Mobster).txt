My motto is "live by the bottle"
So why is my supply low?
Bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though
Ghetto idol i think, but what do I know?
Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Dont act like I'm Hollywood when I prob'ly could
I don't polly
Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West Coast, the home of the bodybag
The shotty, the mag
Los Angeles, where the party at?
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back so have a cardiac
Started back with the black
Rated starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fuckin' started that
Everyday with this game I'm gettin' smarter at
Sky's the limit so everytime I get on a track

*Eminem Intro*
It's not about lyrics anymore, it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

*Eminem*
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids, jeez

Don't give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitz
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
We dont know a word to a verse,
All we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
Cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

*Emine- Chrous*
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you
