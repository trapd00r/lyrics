I was lost, a new beginning
I could hear, the bells were ringing
Waiting, I was waiting

The summer was gone, the roads were crowded
The sky was grey, the sun was clouded
Changing, I was changing

Time was just a word
I never said that I was smart or clever, you said

Come and take me by the hand
(If only for a little while)
Come and take me by the hand
(I only wanna make you smile)
Come and take me by the hand

Suddenly my hearet was aching,
I could feel the ice all breaking
Smiling, I was smiling

The birds ware singing hallelujah,
But you don't really listen like you used to
'Cause now you're used to
Now, when every song has faded, feeling blue,
You're feeling jaded, lost

Come and take me by the hand
(If only for a little while)
Come and take me by the hand
(I only wanna make you smile)
Come and take me by the hand
