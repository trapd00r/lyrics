Send "All I Ask Of You" Ringtone to your Cell No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!
RAOUL
You know I do.

Love me, that's all I ask of you.
(they kiss)

I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me Raoul!

Christine I love you!

Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!

And soon you'll be beside me!

You'll guard me and you'll guide me
(they hurry off and the phantom emerges from behind the statue)

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Christine

Say you'll share with me one love, 
One lifetime say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom asked of you!

Go!
