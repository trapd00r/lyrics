In this context, there's no disrespect, so, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect, from all intellect and let the rhythm effect
Obstacles are inefficient, follow your intuition, free your inner soul and break away from tradition 
Coz when we beat out, girl is pullin' without. You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it till it's burned out. Turn it till it's turned out. Act up from north, west, east, south

Everybody, everybody, let's get into it
Get stupid
Get it started, (come on) get it started, (yea) get it started
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here. 
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here.
Yeah

Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Ya'll hear about it, the Peas'll do it
Get stutted, get stupid
Don't worry 'bout it people will walk you through it
Step by step, like you're into new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits, with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'

Everybody, everybody, let's get into it
Get stupid
Get it started, (come on) get it started, (yea) get it started
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here 
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here 
Let's get it started in (ha), let's get it started in here
