Chorus: *2 
Informer, you no say 
that's who I'm gonna blame 
a licky boom boom down 
Detective man said Daddy Snow 
I stabbed someone down the lane 
a licky boom boom down 

Police than come and 
they blow down my door 
One him crawl through my window 
so than they put me in the back 
of the car at the station 
From that point on I reached my destination 
Now the destination reached 
was the East detention 
where they whipped out my pants and 
looked up my bottom 

Chorus 

The bigger they are 
the think the have more power 
They're say on the phone 
me say no every hour 
I said I want to use it once 
to call my lover 
Lover who I'm gonna call 
Is the one Tammy 
I love her from my heart 
down to my belly 
Yes Daddy Snow, I'm the coolest Daddy 
It's the one MC Shan and the one that is Snow 
together we are like a tornado 

Listen to me better listen to me now 
when I rock the microphone 
I rock it steady 
Yes Sir Daddy Snow 
me are the article done 
when I'm at a dance 
They say where you come from 
People than say I come from Jamaica 
but I'm born and raised in the ghetto 
That's all I want you to know 
my shoes used to tear up and my toes used to show 
where I'm born is the one Toronto, so. 

Chorus 

Come with a nice young lady 
Intelligent, yes she's gentle and irie 
Everywhere I'm go I've never left her at all 
Yes me Snow roam the dance 
Roam the dance in every nation 
You'd never know me Daddy Snow 
I'm the Boom Shakata 
I'll never lay down flat 
in one cardboard box 
Yes me Daddy Snow 
I'm gonna reached the top, so. 

Chorus 

Why would he, why would he would he would he ... 
We sitting round cool 
with my dibby dibby girl 
Police knock my door - lick up my pal 
Rough me up and I can't do a thing 
Pick up my line while the telephone rings 
take me to the station 
Black up my hands 
Trail me down cause I'm hanging with the Snowman 
What I'm gonna do, I'm black and I'm trapped 
Slap me in the face and took all of my gap 
They have no clues and the want to get warmer 
But Shan won't turn Informer 

Chorus
