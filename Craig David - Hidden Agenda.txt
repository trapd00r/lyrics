Hidden Agenda

c'mon baby
de do de de do
ooh yeah
c'mon

now baby
he keeps on saying that he tells you you're the only one
but everybody knows he's out there having fun
behind your back
and that's a fact

and it ain't right
cos he's a fly guy acting like a gentleman
but back in the day i can still remember when
he just turned around 
wouldn't look twice at you

and i'm
just being straight with you
cos he
takes you for a fool
so you
should be on your guard
when he thinks you don't have a clue

and i
think if the truth be known
that you'll 
end up all alone
when he
gets everything he wants
so girl open up your eyes and see
with me

(chorus)
what you see is what you get (And i know it)
ain't no hidden agenda (And im on it)
so girlfriend when he's playing around (Yes i know that he's playin around)
you'll do well to remember
that what you see is what you get (And I"ll show it)
ain't no hidden agenda (No hidden agenda girlfriend)
so girlfriend when he's playing around
you'll do well to remember

now lady
when he tells you that he loves you and won't give you up
takes your car and it's your money that be fillin' it up
look at what he's got
thinks he's hit the jackpot

and it ain't right
cos your connections keep him sweet and that's so typical
he's only in it for himself and that's so cynical
he'd be out of sight girl if you lost it all

so i
feel so bad inside
when he's
cruisin' in your ride
cos i know
baby late at night
there's some other girl by his side

and i
wanna let you know
that he
really ought to go
and you
should believe in me
cos i care baby can't you see
with me

what you see is what you get (girl i know it)
ain't no hidden agenda (and i'm on it)
so girlfriend when he's playing around (yes i know that he's playin' around)
you'll do well to remember
that what you see is what you get (and i'll show it)
ain't no hidden agenda (there ain't no hidden agenda girlfriend)
so girlfriend when he's playing around
you'll do well to remember

now baby girl when he does you wrong
i'll make sure you're alright yeah
i just wanna be your friend
cos there's no reason to pretend
and that's the difference with me

what you see is what you get (girl i know it)
ain't no hidden agenda (and i'm on it)
so girlfriend when he's playing around (yes i know that he's playin' around)
you'll do well to remember
that what you see is what you get (and i'll show it)
ain't no hidden agenda (there ain't no hidden agenda girlfriend)
so girlfriend when he's playing around
you'll do well to remember

think i'll sing it again

what you see is what you get (girl i know it)
ain't no hidden agenda (and i'm on it)
so girlfriend when he's playing around (yes i know that he's playin' around)
you'll do well to remember
that what you see is what you get (and i'll show it)
ain't no hidden agenda (there ain't no hidden agenda girlfriend)
so girlfriend when he's playing around
you'll do well to remember baby
