I'm a stranger on this way
Yet I come here once a year
And it starts to get romantic
'Cause no one's ever there
And with the thought
That I could find him there
Makes it to a place
For dreaming
And the dream gets clear

Maybe it was the sunset
That said it'd come up
As a metaphore if you
Woke me for your breezes
I've underrated you before
And with the feeling
That I'd meet him there
Makes it to a place
For dreaming
And the dream gets clear

The ground's too hard
To suit you, still I wanted
To lay down
Time went so differently
I was under the sun
And with the vision
Of seeing him there
Makes it to a place
For dreaming
And the dream gets clear

I left at noon
With new notes in my ears
Whatever you were playing
I know that it was rare
And with the sound
Of hearing him there
Made it to a place
For dreaming
And the dream was clear
