I thought you're on the run
Getting closer to what you see
Sometimes I realize
Things can change as way to be
Got yourself a picture frame
And read the times one day will come
I thought you would leave
I thought you would see my love

And if I could
Star lit cry
And if I could
Leave it all be...
What if you turn the tide
And take it all too far to hear?

You got my eyes on you
Observing every move you make
Fall down between our souls
Some things are meant to be afraid

Second touch, a time to feel
And our fight is what you fear
I thought I would leave
I thought I would see your love

And if I could
Star lit cry
And if I could
Leave it all be...
What if you turn the tide
And take it all too far to hear?

All I want to do is be next to you
Know I want to see is the way you are
All I want to feel is the inner sense
Lighten up you eyes (echo)

And if I could
Star lit cry
And if I could
Leave it all be...
What if you turn the tide
And take it all too far to hear?
(repeat
