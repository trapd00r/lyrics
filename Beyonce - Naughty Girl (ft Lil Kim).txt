[Lil' Kim]
This is ladies night, once again it's on!
Ya man actin' up? Then leave him home!
It's the girl the industry call the rap Madonna
More dangerous than a tank full of parranas.
Courvoisier in my left arm, glass in my other hand
While I rock that coochie like a rubber band.
I'm feelin' sexy in my million doller Vicki bra
Ay yo Beyonce, how you feelin' ma?

[Beyonce]
I'm feelin' sexy, I wanna hear you say my name boy.
If you can reach me, you can feel my buring flame.
(I'm feelin' kinda N-A-S-T-Y, I juss wanna take you home with me)
Baby, the minute I feel your energy, the vibe is just taking over me (Ahhhhhhhhh) I start feelin' so crazy, babe.
Lately, I feelin' been comin' over me, I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythem's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

(Chrous) [Beyonce]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uhhhhhhhh)
I'm callin' all my girls
We gon' turn this party out, I know you want my body.
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Like, callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down, and I came to party

[Beyonce]
You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours, boy.
The way your body, moves across the floor!
(I'm feelin' kinda N-A-S-T-Y, I juss wanna take you home with me)
Baby, the minute I feel your energy, the vibe is just taking over me (Ahhhhhhhhh) I start feelin' so crazy, babe.
Lately, I feelin' been comin' over me, I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythem's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

(Chrous) [Beyonce]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uhhhhhhhh)
I'm callin' all my girls
We gon' turn this party out, I know you want my body.
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Like, callin' all my girls

(Hook) [Beyonce]
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)

[Lil Kim]
You know I, rep the style when I chef the pie,
I'm back in the kitchen with the flame on high.
I see you lookin', baby what's cookin?
Yeah, I'm lookin' like something to eat.
Your man there lookin' like suttin to freak
Lickin' on his lips like i'm somethin' sweat.
Lil' Kim and Beyonce just tryin to keep the flame lit,
And warm it up like Big Daddy Kane did.

(Chrous) [Beyonce]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uhhhhhhhh)
I'm callin' all my girls
We gon' turn this party out, I know you want my body.
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Like, callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down, and I came to party
