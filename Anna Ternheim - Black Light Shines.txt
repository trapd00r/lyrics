Wake up in a haze
Light as a feather
Amazed by the white linen sheet
Placed over your head

Out of the steel bed
Out of the aches
Released from your head
Thinking kills us all in the end

Black light shines
Over your head on the wall
Black light shines
No name on your badge anymore
Black light shines

The 9th of July
A first last goodbye
Your face in the wind being 5 maybe 6
Without wings you fly

Out of the steel bed
Out of the aches
Released from your head
Thinking kills us all in the end
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Black light shines
Over your head on the wall
Black light shines
No name on your badge anymore
Black light shines

Wake up in a haze
Light as a feather
Amazed by the white linen sheet
Placed over your head

Over your head on the wall
Get up on your feet and walk
Black light shines
Black light shines
Oh black light shines
