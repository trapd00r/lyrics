[dice rolling]
[DMX] Grrrrrrrr..

[Chorus 2X: Ludacris] + (DMX)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

[Ludacris]
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
to step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks
Bustin dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps
We shootin pool at the Luda-plex; I slap a hundred on the table
just to see if any fools wanna do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you wanna do
But come up short and OH THE THANGS that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm makin 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase - scared money don't make none!

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gamblin problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowin steam
Countin green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
all my people bring the strength to the block
Yessir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's gon' do it
It's people livin they LIFE comin up off change
And hustlers payin they bills comin up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate; catch me out in A.C.
Callin yo' bluff with Puff eatin cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breakin the whole casino and doin backflips, man
Cameras eyein us, sidebetters tryin us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buyin us
Tryin to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breakin 'em, and dice still shakin 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em

[Chorus - 2X]
