The night I laid my eyes on you,
Felt everything around me move
Got nervous when you looked my way
But you knew all the words to say.

Then your love slowly moved right in
All this time all my love where you've been.

Me, amore don't you know
My love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet.

Mesmerised in every way
Keep me in a state of daze
Your kisses make my skin feel weak
Always melting in your heat.

Then I soar like a bird in the wind
Oh I glide as I'm flying through heaven.

Me, amore don't you know
my love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet.

Me, amore dont you know
my love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

La lalala lala lalala lala
La lalala lala lalala lala

Me, amore don't you know
my love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet.

Me, amore don't you know
my love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet.
