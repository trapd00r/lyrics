Chorus: 
Everybody move your feet to the rhythm of this beat 
Everybody sing this song all the people having fun 
Everybody move your feet to the rhythm of this beat 
Everybody sing this song all the people having fun 

Vers 1: 
Everybody loves to dance with another summer romance 
Uh baby 
Everybody likes to move all the fellas having the groove 
Uh baby 

Rap 1: 
Music is what I'm living for 
Hit the dance floor like there ain't no more 
Ain't no more time for taking your chance 
Jam digadi jam to this summer romance 
Wave your hands in the air everyone and everywhere 
Move your body jump around check it - it out with the sound 
Everybody, everybody get up and sing it loud 
This is the sound that makes you feel proud 

Vers 2: 
Everybody here tonight we will never start a fight 
Uh baby 
Everybody is feeling proud if you feel it say it loud 
Uh baby 

Rap 2: 
Pleasure and pain sometimes the same 
I'm not ashamed there's no name for the game 
The game that makes my heart still pumpin' 
Boom Boom my body is jumpin' 
Love - every day and night 
The sign for peace is shining bright 
Everybody, everybody get up and sing it loud 
This is the song that makes you feel proud 

Midpart: 
When the sun goes down, and the night moves on 
The time is right to enjoy yourself 
And doing whatever you wanna do 
I mean everybody.
