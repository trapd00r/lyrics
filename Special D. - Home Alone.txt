SPECIAL D. - Home Alone

Put your hands in the air!

Now it's time
To bring in the master
Round 1

I say yeahi-yeahi-yeahi-yeah,
I say yeahi-yeahi-yeahi-yeah (pump up the volume),
Holiday yeah,
Special D. in here. (put your hands in the air)

Today is the day,
School is out from holiday,
Mum and dad are not at home,
It's party time,
I'm home alone,
Ask all my friends to come,
Shake the bums and have some fun,
The party's over here so,
Pump, pump, pump, pump up the volume.

Put your hands in the air!

All the ladies all around,
Getting TV on the sound,
So dancing on the floor,
Take a drink and dance some more,
The neighbours cannot sleep,
'Cause there's stompin' from the beat,
The temperature is hot,
Special D. makes it loud.

Put your hands in the air! (x2)
