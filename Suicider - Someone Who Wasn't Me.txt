Send "If It Wasn't Me" Ringtone to your Cell I Fell like the world could explode right now
And I'd be happy
Free from inside this paper bag
There would only be that first moment
Of pain to face the faces down
If it wasn't me, It'd be somebody else X3
It'd be somebody

I feel like the world could colse in right now
And make a hole from the free flying cloud
And make it stick to one place one face
I saw them dance their liberation

Cool distance from who'll fill your arms x2
