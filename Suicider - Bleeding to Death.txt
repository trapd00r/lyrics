Send "My Suicide" Ringtone to your Cell Mr. Maker, the man above all gods, found a home inside my head
He twisted my values, demanded my favours
(He said); the slaughter of maker must never end
My desperate tries to ignore these voices
Made me feel like coming closer to death?

The murder obsession screamed to my mind
The only voice for you to obey is mine
Don't ever try to quiet maker
for the power of twister is greater than god.

In death they would be gone, and my loneliness would reign.
I would not regret my gruesome actions, nor ever understand them.

The murder obsession screamed to my mind
The only voice for you to obey is mine
Don't ever try to quiet maker
For the power of twister is greater than god.

I feel if I don't get redress
And if they won't leave my head
My suicide will finally be their death

Mr Maker the man above all gods, found a home inside my head
He twisted my values, demanded my favours
(He said); the slaughter of maker must never end
My desperate tries to ignore these voices
Made me feel like coming closer to death?

The murder obsession screamed to my mind
The only voice for you to obey is mine.
Don't ever try to quiet maker,
For the power of twister is greater than god.

I feel if I don't get redress
And if they won't leave my head
My suicide will finally be their death

But my bleeding mind would hopefully return before the day I entered death
So I could feel the pain inside those victims
I await the days in hell, a quiet forever that burns in my soul
No more demands, no more slaughter, I finally found my place in eternity
