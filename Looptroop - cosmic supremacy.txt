Send "Big in Japan (feat. Cos.M.I.C & Supreme)" Ringtone to your Cell I'm all city like graffiti, better yet all country/ 
'bout to go all planet if it goes the way I planned it. Fanatic fan addict but a man at it/ 
Loop Troop's a sickness now we're letting Japan have it. Givin' a bad habit no matter who distributes/ 
no matter what record label I gotta spit the truth. The illest troop you can't keep a good sound down/ 
in Tokyo my shit is heard around town. I'm screamin' on emcees: unless you drop gems please/ 
shut the fuck up, hand over your benz' keys. The way I see things in Europe, nobody's fuckin' with this/ 
and in the states, well I don't really wanna dis. But some rappers take hip hop for granted/ 
watch me run up in their spot like moe and mike mecanic. Panic! When my rhymes cross the atlantic/ 
then cross the pacific if it goes the way I planned it. Fanatic fan addict but a man at it/ 
Loop Troop's a sickness now we lettin' Japan have it! 

Chorus: 
You diggin' me man: Loop Troop big in Japan/ 
kick the real shit and get 3 million fans. 
World supremacy/ p-r-o-m-o-e 
I said you diggin' me man Loop Troop is big in Japan/ 
spit that rah rah shit and get 6 million fans. 
World supremacy/ s-u-p-r-e-m-e 
Hell yeah this be Supreme from the Loop Troop singers/ 
known for hit singles and stiff middle fingers. Just ring us, then bring us for the time of your life/ 
we'll forever be a part of your life cus of your two timing wife. Tout le monde we world wide/ 
your fan base is your man's place they thought your tape was aight. Since you ain't nothing in the streets you pose to be a club thug/ 
all hyped up but never really done shit like that millennium bug. Cos of the drugs, sex and alcohol/ 
I'm in this to rip the clubs, decks and microphones. In Tokyo and former Russia/ 
informers rush the set cus of we hollerin' anarchy like Busta. And cuss the downpressor men from the top of my lungs/ 
till they start makin' sense and be dropppin' their guns. Once my crew gets to speak out they frak out/ 
this ain't supposed to leak out we ain't supposed to sneak out. The back door with balck dough, Loop Troop is like WHOA/ 
conquerin' the world in two triple O's. so: do panic, that bull shit can it/ 
my crew's a sickness and now we letting Japan have it. 

Chorus: 
You diggin' me man Loop Troop is big in Japan/ 
teach the youths the truth and get 10 million fans. 
World supremacy/ Cos to the m-i-c 
It's the DVSG entreprenuers/ 
cruisin' thrue the underground systems to the Japanese sewers. Nobody boo us they more like: sayonara/ 
glad you came, it's the bomb! aight peace we feel honored. We stand as build as one swarm/ 
and travel to the other side of the planet to perform. I look to the east (why?) yo do I even have to mention it/ 
this western world got us trapped in censorship. Cus everything that I say is political/ 
and everything that I write makes me a suspected criminal. Subliminal adertising behind enemy lines/ 
you'll find the message between the lines when you rewind. starting point right here we just landed/ 
Loop Troop's the illest virus now we're lettin' Japan have it. 

Chorus: 
Diggin' me man: Loop troop big in japan/ building a plan to get millions of fans. 
Blao blao bo bo bo/ supreme, cosmic, embee and promoe. 
Du ligger i lä, Loop Troop sticker iväg/ 
över till Japan är jiggy där mä'
