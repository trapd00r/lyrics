All that we need is a little love and some respect 
So we can fly to our dreams, realise what love means 
Could be awesome reality if we lay down love and respect 

(ya all the people ya, we want the love and the respect) 

When the going is hard and the road gets rough 
Hear me now you want to get a little tough 
Don you mind what the people say 
Hear me now they gotta be up at the day 

Love is not ____ 
Love is not the boss 
Loving come to those who love the most 
Hear me now, listen me style 
We come to tell you we don't want no war 

All that we need is a little love and some respect 
So we can fly to our dreams, realise what love means 
Could be awesome reality if we lay down love and respect 

What you give and what you get 
and what you saw, what you read 
Hear me now, so we must complete 
Nations won and a ____ time 
We've got to come together all the positive time 

No matter where you come from or your color or your creed 
Life is life and we must ____ 
Set me on one, set me on roll 
United we stand and divided we fall 

All that we need is a little love and some respect 
So we can fly to our dreams, realise what love means 
Could be awesome reality if we lay down love and respect

Every day you got to be ____ 
Just free up your mind and take your time 
Wisdom is better than silver and gold 
Knowledgement stays as he grows old 
Get up stand up for your rights, and dont give up the fight 
Get up stand up for your rights, and dont give up the fight
