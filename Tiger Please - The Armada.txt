Send "Never Never Never (Groove Armada mix)" Ringtone to your Cell i'd like to run away from you, but if you never found me i would die
i'd like to break the chains you put around me, but i know i never
will
you stay away and all i do is wonder why the hell i wait for you
but when did common sense prevail for lovers when we know it never
will
impossible to live with you, but i know, i could never live without
you
for whatever you do
i never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

you never treat me like you should, so what's the good of loving as i
do
although you always laugh at love, nothing else would be good enough
for you
impossible to live with you, but i know, i could never live without
you
for whatever you do
i never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

you make me laugh, you make me cry, you make me live, you make me die,
for you
you make me sing, you make me sad, you make me glad, you make me mad,
for you

i love you, hate you, love you, hate you
but i'll want you till the world stops turning
for whatever you do
i never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

i love you, hate you, love you, hate you
but i'll want you till the world stops turning
for whatever you do
i never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

i love you, hate you, love you, hate you
but i'll want you till the world stops turning
for whatever you do
i never, never, never want to be in love with anyon
