Who's gonna love you
Who's gonna take my place 
And stand by your side
Kiss you and hold you
Console you when you cry

I'll always love you, I know
Baby, don't go

Come closer, cara cara mia 
Cara cara mia, love is all we need
I swear I'll never gonna leave you
Cara cara mia, you're the one for me
When someone loves like I do
Dreams can come true
So tell me, tell me now
Oh, cara cara mia, cara cara mia how 
Can you leave me now

Make me believe you
So hard for me to 
Understand what went wrong
I've been so certain 
Our love was always strong

Baby, we can't move apart
You're breaking my heart

Come closer, cara cara mia 
Cara cara mia, love is all we need
I swear I'll never gonna leave you
Cara cara mia, you're the one for me
When someone loves like I do
Dreams can come true
So tell me, tell me now
Oh, cara cara mia, cara cara mia how 
Can you leave me now

We can be happy again
Don't you feel that 
It's burning inside, burning inside
We can't give up on each other
I want us to try
Before we say goodbye

Come clo-ser, cara cara mia
Cara cara mia, love is all we need
I swear I'll never gonna leave you 
Cara cara mia, you're the one for me
When someone loves like I do
Dreams can come true
So tell me, tell me now
Oh, cara cara mia 
Can you leave me now
Cara cara mia
Can you leave me now
