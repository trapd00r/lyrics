This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of, but dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing; I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene, straight off the silver screen

So I'll be holding my own breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street; out in the moonlight
And, damn it, this feels too right
It's just like déjà vu; me, standing here with you

So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Ooh, you can't give up (when you're looking for) 
A diamond in the rough (because you never know) 
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh...

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Nobody wants to be the last one there (when you're looking for)
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares (because you never know)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (make sure you're holding on)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.
