She was such an eager companion
I've never seen a pair of eyes more alone
Safety in the arms of a stranger
Hoping his ship would finally bring her home

Lorelie-Marie
Count your blessings if it gets tough
With each gift comes a loss
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
He was imprisoned by his own mind
Troubled after years of never letting go
He could drink all the way to blindness
She would follow him, always be walking alone

Lorelie-Marie
Count your blessings if you feel stuck
Lorelie-Marie
If the road gets dark and you feel lost
We all pay our own costs

They were such eager companions
See them stumble on the most precious dreams
Make a life between the wave break
Catching breath in an ocean of steel

Lorelie-Marie
Count your blessings if you lose touch
Lorelie-Marie
If loves not giving and you had enough
Leave and nothing will be lost
Leave and nothing will be lost...
