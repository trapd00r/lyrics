(Jeezy)
I put on (x4)
I put on for my city, on on for my city (x4)

When they see me up in traffic they say Jeezy on some other shit
Send them pussy niggas runnin straight back to the dealership
Me I'm in my spaceship, that's right I work for Nasa
The 7H is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard
When we're out of jewelry Young gon' do security
It was whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate
If you want it come and get it
You know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin at the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super freight
(Chorus)
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
Put on (east side)
Put on (south side)
Put on (west side)
Put on (x2)

Half bag, top back, ain't nothin but a young thug
HKs, 8 K's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weed look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin me
Blowin on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that glock on me
Don't get caught without one, comin from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, flyin down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

(Chorus)

(Kanye)
I put on... (x3)
I put on for my city, I put on for my
I put on for my city, I put on for my city
On

I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least one of Russell's nieces
On... I let my nightmares go
I put on, everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin when they knew we was broke
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed homie
You can ask big homie, man the top sure lonely i ain't lyin'
So lonely i ain't lyiiiin'
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin lights (flashin lights)
Cause every night (every night)
I put on
(Chorus)
