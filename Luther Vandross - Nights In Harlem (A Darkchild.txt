There's a party in harlem- come on

I like to reminisce about that night we kissed
It was somewhere one night in harlem
The nights were hot and bright 
'Cause sylvia's would burn all night
The people there were really something (you know that's right)
The music always kept us jumpin'
And it used to knock me down when Smokey came to town (and the Miracles, please)
My favorite song was "Tears of the Clown" oh yeah

There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
And I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem

Big sister had a group and they'd sit out on the stoop 
And lordy could they harmanize (oh yeah)
My cousin Joe could blow, just like the radio
And he used to drive them b girls wild
But when grandma started happy dancin' (ooh she gon' break somthin')
She really turned the mother out
I like the way they do it up in Harlem
When there's a party up in Harlem
That's what it's all about 

Ain't nothin like them nights in Harlem
They never fake the funk up there
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem
And tonight I'm gonna take her, back to the 'pollo[Apollo]

there's a party in harlem
they say all the stars will be there 
harlem is a party and everybody's going there
