There's no sense in breaking up with you
But is it what I gotta do
Because you hurt me bad
You're running around
You made me so sad
And everybody in town knows she's not worth you losing me

You know that i love to be your own sweet baby
To ruin you up with every song i'll play
That you're never gonna leave won't you please, please say
I want you by my side until the rivers and the seas run dry

I need you bad (so bad)
Without you (oh no)
I don't know what i'll do
Don't make me do it (la la)
Come back (la la)
Don't make me say what i don't wanna say

There's no sense in breaking up with you
But is it what I gotta do
Because you hurt me bad
You're running around
You made me so sad
And everybody in town knows she's not worth you losing me

I need you bad (so bad)
Without you (oh no)
I don't know what i'll do
Don't make me do it (la la)
Come back (la la)
Don't make me say what i don't wanna say to you

No no
You're gonna break my heart in two
Don't make me do it
