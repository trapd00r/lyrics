Oh and don't you cry  
Just stop for a while  
There is nothing here to worry about  

And take this heart  
That's been torn apart  
You just made it fall to pieces, it died  
 
And I like when I cry  
I go up to see the tears that's falling down from my eyes.  

And you watch the phone  
Think you're all alone  
There is noone there to answer your calls  

And I like when I cry  
I go up to see the tears that's falling down from my eyes  

So this is the story of my heart  
Oh  
Oh  
This is the story of it all  
This is the story of it all  

Oh and don't you cry  
These are better times 
There's no need for all this extra cold

And take your heart  
Make it count for all   
Make it bigger than the fist that you hold  

And I like when I cry  
I go up to see the tears that falling down from my eyes.  

So oh this is the story of my heart  
Oh 
Oh
This is the story of it all  
This is the story of it all
