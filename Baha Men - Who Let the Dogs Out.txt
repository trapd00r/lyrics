Who let the dogs out
Woof, Woof, Woof, Woof, Woof 
Who let the dogs out

Who let the dogs out

V1
The party was nice the party was pumping
Ah Yepee Ah Yo
And everybody having a ball
Yepee Ah Yo
And tell the fellas stop the name callin'
Yepee Ah Yo
Then them girls respond to the call
I hear a woman shout outâ?¦

Chorus 

Last year in the dance you had a ball
You call me millibug and skettell
Get back gruffy, mash scruffy
Get back you flea infested mongrel

V3

Bridge
A doggie is nothing if he don't have a bone
All doggie hold it
Ah doggie is nothing if he don't have a bone
All doggie hold it

Chorus 

Last year in the dance you had a ball
You call me millibug and skettell
Get back fluffy, back scruffy
Get back you flea infested mongrel

RAP
If I was a dog
The party is on
I got to get my groove on
'Cause my mind done gone
Can't you see the rays coming from my eyes
Walking through the place like Digi-man
Breaking it down
Me and my white tail
Short coat
Can't see color
Any color will do
I'll stick on you
That's why they call me pit bull
'Cause I'm the man of the land when they see me
They say oooooh
