Can you hear the rattling rain
Like a cradle song
To iver your pain
Can you feel the howling wind
It's gonna bring
Your thoughts to sin

There's something
About the night
Brings out the woman in me

When the room is dark
And you let it go
The watching shows
And talk throught the walls

When the sheets
Have got you warm
And you fall into the deep
Wish the dreams will give you
A night of good sleep

There's something
About the night
Brings out the woman in me
