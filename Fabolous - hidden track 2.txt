Send "Mindy's Secret Song" Ringtone to your Cell Mindy, this is your secret song.
Don't hold onto this for too long, 
Someone might find it.
Mindy, can you keep a secret?
You probably don't want to hear this, 
But I'm going to say.
I think it's time.

You're incomparably cool, but I know you know that.
And knowing is fine, but you shouldn't hide it.

I imagine you will turn me down.
Let downs are fine, they happen all the time.

Mindy, I'd much like to see you.
I am honest when I speak of your beauty, 
But you think I'm bluffing.

Mindy, look in your driveway, underneath the snow.
That's where I'm hiding, frozen and cold.

You're sensationally sweet.
Impeccably kind.
When I first heard your voice, 
It was just a matter of time.

Impossibly cute.
Definably warm.
So don't second guess yourself or these words.
