Hah, yeah
Oh-uh-oh
Ha
Ha-oh, ah-ah-ah
Try one together, one time a sec
Ha-oh, ah-uh-oh

Oooh!

Yeah!

Well, I ain't about to go to school
Ooo, an' I'm sick an' tired of Golden Rules, ah!

Oh! They say I'm crazy, from the wrong side of the tracks
I never see them, but they're always so far back, oh

Yeah, baby. How to say...Well lemme tell ya about this one time
How ya gonna tell me 
Lemme put it to music, yeah, I say...

Well, I'm sick an' tired of cleanin' room. Oh!
An' it's the final bell for pushing broom. Oh-oh!

Damned if I do an' then I'm damned if I don't
Won't someone tell me what it is they all want?

It makes me blue
Fools, I live with fools
Blue, (Wow!) it makes me blue
Fools, I live with fools

Whoa! Bbbbbbb
I just can't take it

Ah, my teachers all gave up on me
No matter what they say, I, ha, disagree
An' when I need somp'in to soothe my soul
I listen to too much rock n' roll

Don't want no class reunion, the circus just left town
Why behave in public if you're living on a playground?

It makes me blue
Fools, I live with fools
Blue, it makes me blue
Fools, I live with fools. Wow!

(Guitar Solo)

Woo!
Oh, yeah 
Oh! Woo!

Blue, it makes me blue. Makes me blue
Fools, (Oh!) I live with fools. Live with fools
(Wow!) Blue, (Hey hey!) it makes me blue. Makes her blue
Fools, (Oh oh) I live with fools. Whoa! Yeah

Ah, ha ha! Uh, uh!
All right, I said
Mmm, here they goin', my way. Woo! (Woo!)
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
