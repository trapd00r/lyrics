I don't wanna say i'm sorry 
Cause I know there's nothing wrong 
Don't be afraid there's no need to worry 
Cause my feelings for you are still strong 

Hold me in your arms 
And never let me go 
Hold me in your arms 
Cause I need you so 

I can see it in your eyes 
There is something 
Something you wanna tell me 
I see it in your eyes 
There is something 
That you hide from me 
Is there a reason why ?
There is something 
Something you wanna tell me 
I see it in your eyes
There is something 
That you hide from me 

I don't wanna say I'm sorry 
Cuz I know there's nothing wrong 
Don't be afraid
There's no need to worry 
Cuz my feelings for you are still strong 

Hold me in your arms 

Hold me in your arms 
And never let me go 
Hold me in your arms 
Cause I need you so 

I can see it in your eyes 
There is something 
Something you wanna tell me 
I see it in your eyes
There is something 
That you hide from me 
Is there a reason why ?
There is something
Something you wanna tell me 
I see it in your eyes
There is something 
That you hide from me
