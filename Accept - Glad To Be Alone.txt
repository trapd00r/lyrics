I donÂ´t like your fucked up bunch of gentle fellows, my dear
I don't like the stupid people with their well brushed hair
I don't like your well-dressed friends when they talk about their problems
With that kind of small talk, they feel good - but they are fools

I don't like to sit beside you in your brand new car
I don't like the show you need every day and night
You come into my life like someone being a star, but you are no one
After a few days with you I was glad to be alone again

Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone

If you have to work for nothing or some pounds a day
Tears and sweat I had in future not much more to live
You come into my life like someone being a star, but you are no one
After a few days with you I was glad to be alone again

Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
Glad - so glad - so glad - alone
