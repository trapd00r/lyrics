Send "Hear the Sound of a Black Flame Rising" Ringtone to your Cell Dreams made of fire; black is the flame which awakens desire
Tongues touched by fire; defeat the truth and spurn the liar
Pain feeds desire; and sooths the skin inflamed by fire
Blood lights the pyres; I dream of her that breeds desire

Lust loves the fire; let no gods see our souls’ desires
Blood loves desire; in lust we burn and praise the fire
Gods made of fire; live in her who serves desire
Life made of fire; we drink the wine of gods’ desires

Hate loves the liar; dreams are made of blood and fire
Blood sperm and fire; if gods could speak they’d speak of fire

Dreams made of fire; black is the flame which awakens desire
Blood serves desire; and licks the skin untouched by fire
Hate roused by fire; our needs combined consume desire
Lust lights the fire; let no god see my soul’s desires

Stars born of fire; immerse my soul with gods’ desire
Blood touched by fire; in tongues you speak and praise desire
Life raised in fire; lust ascends from blood and fire
Love lights the pyres; black is the heart which submits to desire
