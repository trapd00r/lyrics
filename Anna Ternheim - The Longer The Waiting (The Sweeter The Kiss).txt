Oh, the longer the waiting, the sweeter the kiss
It's better my darling, I promise you this
The next time I hold you, I'm not letting go
Will you wait for me darling, I need to know

Well, you know I'm a sailor and tomorrow we sail
It's a hard way of living, but I know it well
And if I surrender my life to the sea
You can marry another it's alright with me
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Though we won't be together again âtil the spring
Just imagine the treasures I'll bring

Come lay with me, stay with me, soon I'll be gone
I will remember you all winter long
When I return to the one that I miss
Oh, the longer the waiting, the sweeter the kiss
The sweeter the kiss

When the mornings are warm and the valleys are green
I'll come back from wherever I've been

Oh, the longer the waiting, the sweeter the kiss
It's better my darling, I promise you this
The next time I hold you, I'm not letting go
We will give up the ocean forever, I know
Forever I know
