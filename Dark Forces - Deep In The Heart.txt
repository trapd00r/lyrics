Send "Deep Inside Your Heart" Ringtone to your Cell She waits by the window
Counting the stars that fall
Silence becomes her only friend
As the nights grow long
Keep my love baby deep inside your heart
You know I don't want to leave you
But it's time to go
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
I'll always love you
He looks through the window
Watching the city lights rushing by
His ears still ring as the engine
Whines into the sleepless night
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Be with you tonight
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
Now and forever I am yours
Keep my baby deep inside your heart
You know I don't want to leave you
I want you to know
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
Now and forever I am yours
Deep inside your heart
