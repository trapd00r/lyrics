I've stood by, and I've eried, 
while my friends have died 
You ever had a friend kill 
themselves, shot down, or 
knifed? 
Just when I think it's happened 
for the final time, 
it comes knocking back again to 
devastate my life 

20 years of hell 
20 years of hell 
For I've been living far too long 
and I wish my life was done 

I said, "Good-bye" to you, on a 
summer's night 
Now I wish that I had stayed 
with you but, oh it's too late 
next thing I knew was that 
you'd been in an attack 
and you were laying in a cold 
morgue stuffed into a body bag 

I saw you last night you said I 
was wrong 
And where'd I get the idea you 
were gone? 
I woke up to sounds of my own 
screams 
I woke up in a sweat it was just 
a dream 
and that dream goes on and on 
and on... 
with it ever end? Well I don't... I 
don't know 
I don't ... know...
