[1] Ooh Fred come to bed
Cos my Max had sex
With his sexy ex
Oh Fred come to bed
Baby I won't let your dreams get wet

Well I'm Max I'm Max - baby don't be blue
Don't you worry don't be sorry
I'll come back to you
Just one more night with my poor old ex
She's only lonely we don't have sex
I'm Max Max Max
Baby please stay cool and just relax
I'll soon be back but if you feel sad
Just go and talk to my friend Fred

[repeat 1]

[2] Ooh Fred come to bed
Baby you will get
A love you never had
So Fred come to bed
Or my fantasy will drive me mad oooh

I'm Max I'm Max and I trust in Fred
Baby he's the best friend I've ever had
It's Fred it's Fred - baby just call Fred
And anything you ever wanted you will get
Call Fred Fred Fred
And you will find it's not so bad
It's just one night - baby you'll get through
Tomorrow I'll be back with you

[repeat 1]

[repeat 2]

Oooh Fred come to bed

Oh my Max had sex
With his ex last night
Cos he loves her ass and tits
So I tell you Fred
Come into my bed
If you don't - I will call up Fritz
