The lights in the harbor don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship adrift on the sea

Sea of heartbreak, lost love, loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine
I wish you were mine again my dear on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you? Oh, where did I fail?
Why did you leave me always to sail?

Sea of heartbreak, lost love, loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine
I wish you were mine again my dear on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Oh, what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more

Come to my rescue, oh, come here to me
Take me and keep me away from the sea

Sea of heartbreak, lost love, loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine
I wish you were mine again my dear on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Sea of heartbreak, lost love, loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine
I wish you were mine again my dear on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak, sea of heartbreak
The sea of heartbreak
