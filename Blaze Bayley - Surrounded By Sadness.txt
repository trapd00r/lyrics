Forsaking every other thing 
Leaving uncertainties behind 
From the loneliness and the dark 
I came into your light 
No more sadness surrounding me 

My heart is beating its last beat 
As I am breathing my last breath 
For what I could not live without 
Has gone and will not come again 
Surrounded by sadness
