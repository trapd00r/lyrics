Sometimes I`m far away from everything you know
All the answers gone
but time is running out
Wherever I`m going through
I feel like on the beach full of sun
So close and so far
and how it makes me happy all the time...

Out of your love
Heaven can fall
I won't let down but I can't take this all
How should I know that could be hard
I never knew that could make me so tough
Out of your love
Heaven can fall
I saw these things that I should seen before
Now things are lost now it's enough
to understand how to be still the last
