Damn you I'm falling
I've been playing too long
and my heart's got me wrong
and I'm stuck between two border-lines
Damn you I'm falling
thought we had the same rules
but that lousytrick you used
really got me
Damn you I'm falling
thought I stood on steady ground
but I'm sort of flying around
and it scares me so
Give it all up for you
Give it all up when time just stunned my memories
Give it all up noway
Give it all up I've had too many setbacks
heard too many lies too trust you
Damn you I'm falling
inside me there's a war
but everything you call me
I know you've won it
Damn you I'm falling
feel naked so take what you need
but darling please
leave me unaffected
