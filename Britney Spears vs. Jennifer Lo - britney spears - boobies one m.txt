Louis: It seems today, that all you see is violence in movies, and sex on T.V.
Peter: But where are those good old-fashioned values, on which we used to rely?
Brian: It used to be, a big time star was elegant as Garbo, or Hedy Lamarr.
Stewie: But now we get whores like Jenny Lopez, you want to curl up and die.
Chorus: Lucky thereâs a Family Guy. Lucky thereâs a man who positively can do all the things that make us-
Stewie: Laugh and cry!
Chorus: Heâs a Family Guy!

Louis: When I was young, the songs were fair, with Mister Johnny Mathis, and Sonny and Cher.
Peter: But now we get Justin Timber-homo.
Louis: A heartache all gone awry!
Brian: The classic films were works of arts, the images were graceful, the stories were smart.
Stewie: But now we get Matrix Revolution, Iâm sorry I know this doesnât rhyme, but what the hell were you Wachowski Brothers thinking?!
Chorus: Lucky thereâs a family guy, lucky thereâs a fella, sweeter than vanilla, wholesome as a piece of-
Stewie: Apple Pie!
Chorus: Heâs a family guy!

Lois: His smileâs a simple delight.
Chris: He lets me see the boobies on the internet sites.
Lois: Peter!
Meg: He bought me my cute little hat.
Brian: Yeah we should have a talk about that.
Chorus: About that! And his hat!

Brian: Heâs mastered the comedy arts.
Stewie: He says, âLook out, Hiroshima!â then casually farts. (fart sound effect)
Lois: Heâs loaded with sexy appeal.
Peter: And best of all my titties are real. Have a feel!
Brian: No thank you.
Stewie: I gave it the office.
Lois: The Brady Bunch has got their Mike and pretty Laura Petrie has Dicky Van Dyke. But who around here could fill those loafers?
Chorus: But hereâs a happy reply. Lucky thereâs a family guy. Lucky thereâs a man who positively can do all the thing that make us-
Stewie: Laugh and Cry!
Chorus: Heâs a Family Guy! Heâs a Family Guy!!!

Lois: Oh My! Thank you very much! What a welcome.
Peter: I am gunna buy each and every one of you a beer after the show. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Iâm kidding for Christâs sake, Iâm not serious. Thatâs expensive! Look, just the fact that I came up with the idea should tell you Iâm generous; I shouldnât actually have to spend any money.
Meg: Uh, can we turn the spotlight down a bit?
Brian: Yeah, it is a little bright.
Stewie: You know Brian, I- I just noticed something. With that light shining on you from that angle, you look a lot like Jamie Farr.
Brian: Yeah, youâve told me that before and uh, itâs interesting, because Iâm thinking you look a lot like Britney Spears.
Stewie: Really?! How so?
Brian: Well, you- you got that thing going on with your eyes like Britney does. You know whereâ¦
You know how her eyes are just like a hair too far apart? Uh, a- a- almost like there was some immediate post-birth surgery that should have been done but it was the south, so they didnât have the medical technology.
Stewie: Oh, I see.
Chris: Mom!
Lois: Yes honey?
Chris: I have a wedgie.
Lois: Chris, honey, wait until the intermission. Then you can fix it.
Peter: Well, we got a lot of fun stuff lined up here tonight. We got music, we got comedy, we got behind the scenes crap from the show.
Lois: Thatâs right! For example, not a lot of people know this, but in one episode of the show there was a flashback of Brian when he was a puppy. Now, they couldnât find a puppy who looked enough like him, so they actually built a dog suit for the scene, and the actor of inside the suit was Raven-SymonÃ©, who was Olivia on the Cosby show.
Brian: Fascinating bit of trivia.
Peter: All right, okay, I got one for ya. You know the sound stage where we shoot Family Guy is the same stage where they shot the Golden Girls back in the 80âs, right? Now one of the stage hands was telling me a- a pretty intense story. I guess there was one night when they were all ready to shoot, and uh, the audience was waiting. And uh, nobody could find Bea Arthur. So everybodyâs freaking out and uh, then one of the producers runs in and says âCancel the show tonight. Bea Arthurâs in jail!
Lois: Oh My God!
Peter: Yeah. Apparently she had a little too much to drink before the show and uh, they found her standing on the street corner, exposing her penis to traffic.
Brian: Oh My God!
Meg: Ew! Thatâs Disgusting!
Peter: Can you believe that?
Brian: Wait a minute. How the hell can Bea Arthur have a penis?
Peter: Eh, special permit.
Stewie: I say, what is it with these actors? Theyâre perfectly normal people in civilian life and then they come out to Hollywood and just go fucking berserk.
Brian: You gotta watch your language, kid.
Stewie: Oh, itâs a record album for Godâs sake. Letâs cut loose a bit.
Chris: Nipples! Hehe.
Stewie: Perfect example. Although I must say I am amazed at the language you can get away with on television these days. I- I was watching Law and Order the other night and I swear to god, I heard someone use the word âballsâ. And I thought to myself, âMy God, that- that Dick Wolf just does whatever he damn well pleases, doesnât he? Bringing words like âballsâ into Americaâs living rooms. I wonder how heâd like it if I just walked into his living room a- and use the word âballsâ.
Brian: Uhâ¦ I think that would be breaking and entering.
Lois: You know, I am so glad they allowed us to bring Stewie this evening. The last show we did we had to leave him at home. They didnât allow babies in the theater.
Brian: Well of course. People wanted to be able to enjoy the show
Stewie: I am a show you lack-witted beetle head! Ugh! Oh what a night that was. My babysitter was a total bitch.
Lois: Stewie! Thatâs very rude. Especially since your babysitter is here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Hailey Duff.
Hailey Duff: Hi Mr. and Mrs. Griffin
Peter: Howâre ya, sweetheart?
Lois: So was it really that bad babysitting Stewie?
Hailey Duff: You want the truth? Well, okay. So after you and Peter left for dinner, I- No. Wait a minute. Letâs tell this story right. Chorus please.
