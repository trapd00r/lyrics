"Wow"
"I can feel it now"

[Verse One]
Make noise like mad Bocce boys
Plus I'm poised
I leave the world overjoyed
Deployed all my tactics to avoid the black magics
Slack [?] be crazy to trust
That that could happen
Will ever come to be the real
I release my verbs and let my will destroy and build
Overkill with imitations of a [?] facial expression
Complacent, leaving us guessing while we were waiting
Cause you're looking
Finding things to burn that's not wooden
Bring it back to reality, some heads say I shouldn't
I'm the big spoon in the pudding of your brain when the tune plays and swings
They told me I amaze with ill things
Balance life like being [?] up in smoke just like Sting
Like I'm not listening, is how I might seem
Rocking the mics not illusions, I'm doing it now
Vibes on foul
I'm not hallucinating, here's Wow
I got control of nine senses
Of all these cats, I took a census
So I know who's getting over like fences
A show condenses all the heads to front row positions to listen and rock along
And see me rip the mic going on
All these tangents can't explain how I plan this shit to bang
It's not enough to just try
If life's a book I'm chapter five

"Wow"
"I can feel it now"
"Wow"
"I can feel it"
"Wow"
"I can feel it now"
"Wow"
"I can feel it"

[Verse Two]
Kids be trife, I'm lifetimes beyond your dopest rhyme
Even in the past before I blast a rhyme verse
I'm everlast and ever present you're forever a peasant
Praising me and getting taxed heavily
You wanna see my throne in action
With ill flashbacks of the last time we met
Or the first
What matters to me makes no sense to you to stay true
A concept beyond comprehension, never mention the truth
I'm sure you'll eject parachute
But get gunned down with surface to air projectiles
Kids see me, I collect smiles
Believe my sleeve gets tugged
I drugged my mind for a while, realized the systematic
I see wack kids and give them friction like static
Electric currency, burning me and us
We trust time will tell no lies only surprise
Don't let it be a shock when I flip
Dipped after I rock them
Questions come I let the dumb remain
Spark brains that wanna be sparked
Bring a light if you can't stand stay in the dark
For me I need to see the road in front of me
MC's don't know they never have
Couldn't fuck with the math, they calculate a format
You're trapped like rats in a maze, biting my rhyme page
Couldn't fuck with the math, they calculate a format
You're trapped like rats in a maze, biting my rhyme page
