Send "Tom's Diner (feat. DNA)" Ringtone to your Cell I am sitting in the morning
at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
for the man to pour the coffee

And he fills it only halfway
and before I even argue
he is looking out the window
at sombody coming in

"It is always nice to see you",
says the man behind the counter
to the woman who has come in
she is shaking her umbrella

And I look the other way
as they are kissing their hellos
I'm pretending not to see them
instead I pour the milk

And I open up the paper
there's a story of an actor
who has died while he was drinking
it was no one I had heard of

And I'm turning to the horoscope
and looking for the funnies
when I'm feeling someone watching me
and so i raise my head

There's a woman on the outside
looking inside. does she see me?
no she does not really see me
cause she sees her own reflection

And I'm trying not to notice
that she's hitching up her skirt
While she's straightening her stockings
her hair is getting wet

Oh, this rain it will continue
through the morning as I'm listening
to the bells of the cathedral
I am thinking of your voice...

I finish up my coffee
It's time to catch the train
