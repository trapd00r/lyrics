Chorus: Eminem)
I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no)
I don't need no education (education)
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna save the nation
Daddy NO
I just wanna live my life (I don't need no)
Everyday a celebration (self-control)
One day I'ma leave this world
I wait for the revelation

(Bizarre)
I wanna kill myself!
I'm still debating
In front of a Baptist Church masturbatin
Praying to Satan
Think I'm crazy cuz I smoke crack
Live on B with the mac
In a two family flat (Fuck it)
Tired of getting hit in the face with a broom
My mom's on her period
My dad's in my room (Daddy no!)
I got ten rocks that I need to get out
I sold 'em in five minutes
In my own damn house
(My mom smokes crack)
My poor grandmother
God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS
She was waiting to die of a cold
There's three things to keep me from being a Nazi
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace

(Kon Artis)
No matter how bad the beating
I went to school cheating
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting
Skipping school, I had to have nuts just to do it
Got born and became truant
When I had the gaul to go
I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by this peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held
By the tip of a barrel
Getting threatened to get your skin
Ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids
Never got rushed for their apparel like me
Outcast
Last to class
First to leave
When the teacher called on me
Best believe
I had something up my sleeve

(Eminem)
I been praised and labeled as crazy
My mother wasn't able to raise me
Full of crazy rage
An angry teenager
Nothing could change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boosted and
So influenced by music
I used it as an excuse to do shit
Ooh I was stupid
No one could tell me nothing
Hip hop overwhelmed me
To the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
It was like isolating myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school had failed me
Expelled me
And when the principal would tell me I was nothing
And I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at it
A fucking drop-out that quit
Stupid as shit
Rich as fuck
And proud of it
Thats why...

(Chorus)
I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no)
I don't need no education (education)
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna save the nation
Daddy NO
I just wanna live my life (I don't need no)
Everyday a celebration (self-control)
One day I'ma leave this world
I'm waiting for the revelation

(Swifty)
I was raised with a rifle and mask
Steadily beating my psychiatrist's ass
Just for asking about my past
I was never on that punk shit
Fucking around could get your beloved abducted
Smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father
It must have been poison in that nigga's nutt
Far as probation
Fuck peeing in cups
I violate it anytime
Let 'em see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbating inside a cell
Drunk as hell
Having conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't leniant
A disobedient lynch
that slapped teachers
Bitch I'm not reading it
You don't know what dogs go through
A little nigga sipping liquor
With my old dude
What the fuck you gon' do?
I'm quick to curse you
I told my mother that I'ma hurt you
If you ever again mention a curfew

(Kuniva)
Look
My family ignores me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell 'em
I'll be right back
This nice beautiful house mom?
It don't mean shit
Cuz you know Daddy's a drunk
And he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man
I couldn't stand up to him
I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this
I wish on Christmas
That I can get a loaded four-fifth
And put a fucking end to this (Fuck it!)
I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothing to smile about
I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine
Now I'm wildin' out

(Proof)
when schools over
Pupil or people to shoot through
Kids going cuckoo
With a two-two
Since my friend is this new dude
In his high school
Losing his noodle
Learning people don't like you
The football jocks is
Spitting on him
Popular kids in school that's now picking on him
Burn out youngsta niggas now hitting on him
And his teacher in his English class keep flipping on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
For drinking forty ounces
Cuz he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?
Already got expelled for wearing a trenchcoat
All I ever seen is
(Violence, violence)
Told me to keep silent
Stop batting my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blow out my brains
and murdered you all...(FUCK YOU)

(Chorus: Eminem)
I don't wanna go to school (I don't need no)
I don't need no education (education)
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna save the nation
Daddy NO
I just wanna live my life (I don't need no)
Everyday a celebration (self-control)
One day I'ma leave this world
I wait for the revelation
