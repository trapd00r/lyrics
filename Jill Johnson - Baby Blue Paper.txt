Write me a letter
On baby blue paper
Write it in gray white board pen
Pick up the telephone
Do it sooner than later
Anytime that you'll need a friend

Well talk through your fears
I'll chase away the ghost
I promise I'll be here
And make sure you know...

You're not alone in this world
You're just a little girl
Nobody said you have to be so brave
Those tears you have to cry
And times that you ask why
You love someone and then they go away
You're just a little girl

Tell me 'bout your mother
Tell me how you lost her
And how you never got to say goodbye
All the things you can remember
The things you did together
The love you felt when you looked in her eyes

Deeper in your heart
When life gets hard to bare
Keep her in your dreams
And know she's always there

You're not alone in this world
You're just a little girl
Nobody said you have to be so brave
Those tears you have to cry
And times that you ask why
You love someone and then they go away
Oh, you're just a little girl
But not alone in this world

Ohhhh
Ohhhh
