Fell in love with my lover in the morning
Or maybe I fell long before you
Now I wonder what lovers are missing
And how the name seems to me passing through

It's so sad but maybe you're self-caused trouble
Perhaps I've been sad longer than you
I might have been fooling my lover
You have always been so much more to me

Ain't got the heart baby
I ain't got the heart
Go with the morning
I'll stay with my heart

I ain't got the heart baby
I ain't got the heart
Go with the morning
I'll stay with my heart
Stay with my heart

You know I was sent for that morning
Or maybe it just was the night that threw me out

I ain't got the heart baby
I ain't got the heart
Go with the morning
I'll stay with my heart

I ain't got the heart
I ain't got the heart
Go with the morning
I'll stay with my heart
I'll stay with my heart
I'll stay with my heart
