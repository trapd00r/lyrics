Standing with my enemies
Hung on my horns
with haste and reverie
killing with charm

only happy when you hurt
only deadly in a swarm
only healthy in the dirt
only empty in your arms

I play,I'm sick and tame
drawing the hordes
I wait,and show the lame
the meaning of harm
the skulls beneath my feet
like feathers in sand
I graze among the graves
a feeling of peace

only bending when you break
only feeding when you're cold
only healing when you ache
only feeling when you don't
