And once again despair is kissing me 
With her cold ghostly lips 
My own destruction is leading me to my grave 
That I digged for many times 
And once again I'm becoming a spectral thought 
Forgotten, sad, miserable s**t 
As I fall into the black spheres among lonely memories 
You've broken us, piece by piece 

The score of my soundtrack is written by blood 
Music of suicide written in red 
I did it myself, my wrists are also opened 
And like my tears, it's cascading 
Everything has been lost behind us 
On my kness, hands on my face 
The sun is appearing into the spring morning 
Where I'm lying there's just nothing than my dust 

Now you don't care about him 
You live on the other side of feelings 
But our February snow 
is now covering my lifeless body
