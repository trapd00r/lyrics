Tell me when you're coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
(When are you comin' home, baby, baby)
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back

You were in my arms yesterday, and now you're gone
I still feel your lips on mine, still feel your touch
Safe inside your arms is where I want to be, can't stand this space
Boy, I'm gettin' lonely, and out of place

Don't stray for too long
(Till the next time)
Go back to my arms
Don't stray for too long
(Till the next time)
Go back to my arms

Tell me when you're coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
(When are you comin' home, baby, baby)
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back

I sit here and wait patently for the telephone
Funny how I miss you, and I miss you so
When you're not at home

Don't stray for too long
(Till the next time)
Go back to my arms
Don't stray for too long
(Till the next time)
Go back to my arms

Tell me when you're coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
(When are you comin' home, baby, baby)
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back

Tell me when you're coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
(When are you comin' home, baby, baby)
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back

Don't stray for too long
(Till the next time)
Go back to my arms
Don't stray for too long
(Till the next time)
Go back to my arms

Tell me when you're coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
(When are you comin' home, baby, baby)
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
When are you comin' back, when are you coming back
