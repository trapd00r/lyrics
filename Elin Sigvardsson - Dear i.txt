Dear eye, don't cry until it's over. 
You're fine and your looks won't grow older. 
Don't kill what runs up and down your hill before you're sure, 
Just fill you own imagination with the thrill from before.

If I'd let you fall behind, 
Would you still wanna be mine, would you like to resign 
If I'd let you cross my mind, would you mind?

Dear head lay and rest against my shoulder. 
We've had our summer, now let's crash into october. 
Beside all the leaves you sit and hide from everything.
You're tired and you don't wanna listen to the lines that I sing. 

If I'd let you fall behind, 
Would you still wanna be mine, would you like to resign 
If I'd let you cross my mind, would you mind?

Dear hands, please lay yourselves down on me. 
This fall you can let those arms surround me...

If I'd let you fall behind, 
Would you still wanna be mine, would you like to resign. 
If I'd let you cross my mind, would you mind?
