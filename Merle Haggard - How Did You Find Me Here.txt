Send "How Did You Find Me Here" Ringtone to your Cell Written by Merle and Theresa Haggard

How did you find me
How did you know
Id be here in this hole in the ground
I cant even see out over the edge
Looking up from all the way down

I thought Id been left here to die
When I saw your face appear
What a surprise
How did you find me here

I thought I could do it
All of it all by myself
I thought I could win every round
Then I hit rock bottom
And the blues I got em
You lifted me out of my fear
How did you find me here

I thought I could do it
All of it all by myself
I thought I could win every round
Then I hit rock bottom
And the blues I got em
Lifted me out of my fear
But how did you find me here

Then I hit rock bottom
And the blues I got em
And you lifted me out of the fear
But how did you find me here
(Thank you Lord)
