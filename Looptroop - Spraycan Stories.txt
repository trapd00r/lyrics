ay yo graff can't be faded

a couple of years ago me and my man
went out of town to rack up some cans
'cause shit it got hot here in västerås
it was time to dress up in our best racking clothes
in my jacket i could take eight cans
if shit was smooth four more in my pants
that adds up to twelve so i guess you could tell
we had high expertasions that shit would go well
we went to catch the train at the train station
we didn't pay the fare we only paid attention
to avoid any situation of confrontation
with the law
and i saw nothing that arose my suspicion
so the mission was on 
we soon reached our destination
didn't know what we was facin'or what was waitin'
for us - as we entered in the gas station
took a look around everything seemed easy
matter of fact shit was so cool that we was freezin'
we saw the cans and they had us made open
had no id an undercover was scopin
checking us out from behind this shelf
as me and nob started racking up as hell
after a while i had to get out to empty out my jacket
so i could come back in and do some more racking
then i saw this man in the corner of my eye
i started walking faster he started to jog
so i ran frantically and threw away my burden
he was shoutin' "stop him" like i commited murder
but nobody got in my way though i guess i was lucky
he hopped inside the car and drove up right next to me
hopped up beside me screamed "i got yoy my friend"
well i kept on running and got ahead again
he kept on chasin' me for like a kilometer
it was killing me unless i had a chance to take a breather
either i get busted or i find a place to hide
the first building on my left i dipped inside
mad tired but i made it up the stairs
picked out the window at the top and believe me i got scared
when i saw him walking by on the street beneath
i was breathin' heavily and hurting from my knees
please don't let this motherfucker catch me
i thought to myself cause my parents won't be happy
when he entered the buildin' next to mine i thought i was safe
then he came back out and headed straight for my hiding place
i thought fuck now i'm stuck like a mouse
in a mouse trap manifested as this house
i couldn't get out i rang the doorbell hopin'
someone would open and let me in without questions
but nobody was home and that was only to the better
'cause if someone had opened the door the undercover
would have heard and the noise and then come up there
but instead he stayed downstairs and just stared
up the stair waitin' then went on his way
but i stayed and everytime i heard a car accelerate
or hit the breaks i thought the cops were comin to causerie
me and set me straight for the grand theft
but nothing happened for like an hour so i left
for the train station my man was there waitin'
i saw something was goin' on so i asked him is something wrong
and i couldn't believe my ears when i heard him respond
word is born that undercover svan
grabbed me instead of you and made me pay a fine
so this rhyme is dedicated to my man
nob i got mad love from the sub to the above
for you 'cause you kept your mouth shut when
they wanted my name now that's a true friend
so when you need help with anything any day
just give me a call i'll come over right away
