Hey y'all, 
we is havin a ball,
And you know they ask me to get on the mic,
And they ask me,
Can I kick it? word
Yes you can
Can I kick it?
Yes you can

(Q-Tip)
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Well I'm gone...
Gone.....

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like a Tribe does,
Before this did you really know what life was,
Comprehend to the track for its wide cos,
Gettin mentions on the tip of the vibe buzz,
Rock 'n' roll to the beat of the funk fuzz,
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug,
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitter bug,
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug,
Afro-centric living is a big shrug,
A life filled with *horn* thats what I love,
A lower plateu is what we're above,
If you diss us we wont even think of,
Will nipper the doggy give a big shove,
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove,
Like a box of positives its a plus love,
As the Tribe flies high like a dove...

Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Can I kick it? Yes you can!
Well I'm gone....
Gone.....

Can I kick it? To my tribe that flows in layers,
Right now Phife is a poem sayer,
At times I'm a studio conveyer,
Mr. Dinkens would you please be my mayor,
You'll be doing us a really big favour,
Boy this track really has a lot of flavour,
When it comes to rhythms Quest is your savior,
Follow us for the funky behavior,
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya,
Feel free to drop your pants and check your hair,
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer,
A rhythm recipe that you'll savour,
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major,
Yes the Tribe of the game rhythm player,
And you inhale like a breath of fresh air...
