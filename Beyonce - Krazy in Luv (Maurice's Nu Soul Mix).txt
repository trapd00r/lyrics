I know that you hating me,
But I'm, yeah ih yeah

Hey how ya doin', yeah I'm doin' mighty fine
Last time I seen ya, it's been a long time
Stop smilin' at me, get that look off your face
Please don't even front, stop bein' so fake
I know you do not like me and you made it very clear
You're always talkin' about me from what I hear
Always put me down when you thought that you could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Kelly:]
Wasn't it you that said
Thought I was all that and you
Said I didn't have a clue
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through
And wasn't it you that said
That I didn't look too good,
That I wouldn't do too good
I'd never make it out the 'hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so, so good

So good, so good, I'm doin' so good
I know you hating me, but I'm
So good, so good, yeah yeah
I'm doin' so good
I'm doin' so good

So good, so good, I'm doin' so good
I know you hating me, but I'm
So good, so good,
I'm doin' so good
I'm doin' so good

[Beyonce]
This is for them haters that said we wouldn't make it
Now we sellin' million and now you can't take it
For all the people 'round us that have been negative
Look at us now and see how we live
I stayed down wit' my people, all the ones that keep it real
Didn't get caught up, and how'd it make you feel?
All the things I'm doin' that you thought I never could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good
