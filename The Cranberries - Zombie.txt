Another head hangs lowly, 
Child is, slowly, taken.
And the violence caused such silence, 
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it’s not me, it’s not my family. 
In your head, in your head they are fighting, 
With their tanks, and their bombs, 
And their bombs, and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are crying... 

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie,
Hey, hey, hey.
What’s in your head,
In your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, 
dou, dou, dou-dou-dou...

Another mother’s breakin’
Heart is taken over
When the violence causes silence,
We must be mistaken

It’s the same old theme since 1916:
In your head, in your head they’re still fighting, 
With their tanks, and their bombs, 
And their bombs, and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are dying... 

In your head, in your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie,
Hey, hey, hey!
What’s in your head,
In your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, ya, ya-a...
