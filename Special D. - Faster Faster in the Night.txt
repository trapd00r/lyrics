Hey old friend, let's look back
On the crazy clothes we wore
Ain't it fun to look back
And to see it's all been done before

All those nights together
Are a special memory
And I can't wait for tomorrow
Just as long as you're
dancing next to me

Cause it's so clear
Every year
We get stronger
What's gone is gone
The past is the past
Turn the radio up
And then hit the gas

Cause . . .
I know we've Come So Far
But we've Got So Far To Go
I know the road seems long
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go

So, most days we'll take it fast
And some nights lets take it slow
I know we've Come So Far
But baby
We've Got So Far To Go

Hey old friend, together
Side by side and year by year
The road was filled with twists
and turns
Oh but that's the road that
got us here

Let's move past the bad times
But before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget
And learn from the mistakes we made

Cause it's so clear
Every year
We get stronger
So don't give up
Don't say when
And just get back on the road again

Cause . . .
I know we've Come So Far
But we've Got So Far To Go
I know the road seems long
But it won't be long till it's
time to go

So, most days we'll take it fast
And some nights lets take it slow
I know we've Come So Far
Oh but baby, baby
We've Got So Far To Go

Hey old friend come along for the ride
There's plenty of room so jump inside
The highway's rocky every now and then
But it so much better than
where I've been

Just keep movin', at your own speed
Your heart is all the compass
you'll ever need
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows
what's gone, gone, gone

Cause it's so clear
Every year
We get stronger
So shine that light
Take my hand
And let's dance into tomorrow land

Cause . . .
I know we've Come So Far
But we've Got So Far To Go
I know the road seems long
But it won't be long till it's
time to go

So, most days we'll take it fast
And some nights lets take it slow
I know we've Come So Far
Oh but baby, baby
We've Got So Far To Go
