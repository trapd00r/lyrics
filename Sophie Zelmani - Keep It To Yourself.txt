You keep it to yourself
You keep it to yourself
It's your treasure
But you're not thinking
Of my health

Like this morning
Were you dreaming
Was it a night in hell
It's your burden
But I'm not feeling well

You're gone with your feelings
Are you taking care
If you're good
At what you're doing
It's good that I'm here

You just disappear
You just disappear
It's your talent
But I only get scared
