Send "Voodoo Magic" Ringtone to your Cell I hang on my computer 
Obsessed with late night mails 
I press return to sender 
And sweep the holy grail 
The air has gone electric 
I feel my legs go weak 
Your presence is effective 
I start dancing like a freak 

Oh oooh do you think I'm looking tragic 
Oh oooh cause I can't stop this voodoo magic 
Oh oooh you have cast a spell on me tonight 
Magic voodoo magic voodoo magic 
Voodoo magic 

I had a close encounter 
The third and last degree 
I'm locked inside a spaceship 
And you have got the key 
You must have been the angel 
Who lost the grace of God 
Cause I can't help repeating 
Your sweet hymn on my iPod 

Oh oooh do you think I'm looking tragic 
Oh oooh cause I can't stop this voodoo magic 
Oh oooh you have cast a spell on me tonight 
Magic voodoo magic voodoo magic 
Voodoo magic 

A dream within a dream 
Behind the screen lies another dream 
Within a dream 
A scene within a scene 
Beyond your dream I'm your heroine 

Oh oooh do you think I'm looking tragic 
Oh oooh cause I can't stop this voodoo magic 
Oh oooh you have cast a spell on me tonight 
Magic voodoo magic voodoo magic 
Voodoo magic
