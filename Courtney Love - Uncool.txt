Pretty faces grab the headlines
You leave me nothing but my name
And all the grief keeps multiplying
And I pretend to feel no pain

Never gonna lose, baby
If I tell the truth
Would I be uncool
If I could write a love song?
I just wanna believe
You tried to hold me
Spend our whole life 
Now i feel so lost

I get tired of the pleasure
My company's so cheap
Baby, take me from this tempest
Take me someplace so I can sleep
(Sleep, sleep)

I don't wanna die and I don't wanna live
Baby, I just want a chance to be with you
I tried, oh, I love you
I swear to god I never felt so alive

Never gonna lose
If I tell the truth
Would it be uncool
If I could write a love song?
I just wanna believe
You tried to hold me
And every time you move
And everytime you breathe
Yeah, I gotta write a love song

Baby, you're a freakshow just like me
Baby, we're all born ugly
Gotta write a love song

Gonna make you cry, I'm gonna go so deep
Tear the world up
Somemewhere I can sleep
And I wonder why
And I wonder why
And I cry

Wanna be uncool
Wanna be uncool

Now I'm gonna make you cry
'Cause I'm gonna go so deep
I'm gonna tear this tempest, baby
And go somewhere I can sleep
Gonna make you love me
Gonna make you love me
Yeah

Never gonna lose
If I tell the truth
Would it be uncool
If I could write a love song?
I just wanna believe
You tried to hold me
And every time you move
And everytime you breathe
Yeah, I gotta write a love song

Baby, you're a freakshow just like me
Baby, we're all born ugly
Gotta write a love song

Gonna make you cry, I'm gonna go so deep
Tear the world up
Somewhere I can sleep
I wanna write a love song
Wanna be uncool
Wanna be uncool
I wanna write a love song
Wanna be uncool
Wanna be uncool
I wanna write a love song
Wanna be uncool
Wanna be uncool
I'm gonna be uncool
