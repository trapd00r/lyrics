L&lt;Some velvet morning
When I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
and maybe tell you about Phaedra
and how she gave me life
and how she made it in
Some velvet morning
When I'm straight

N(Flowers growing on a hill
Dragonflies and daffodils
Learn from us very much
Look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name

Secrets are the things we grow
Learn from us very much
