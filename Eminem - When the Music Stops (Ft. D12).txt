Music... Reality...
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers, have a responsibility, to these kids
Psyche 

[Eminem]
If I, were to die, murdered in cold blood tommorrow
would you feel sorrow, or show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter if there ain't shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battlin'
but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
there's too much on my plate, I done came way
too far in this game, to turn and walk away, and not say what I got to say
what the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, gun myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryin' to smack this one out the park
five-thousand mark, y'all steady tryin' to drown a shark
ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off, lid to the can of whip ass, just twist me off
see me leap out, pull a piece out, fuck shootin', I'm just tryin' to knock his teeth out
fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act
when we confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops

[Swifty]
Ain't no getting' rid of McVeigh
if so you woulda tried, the only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
arrived ride back at my enemies' crib with Hennessey, got drunk then I finish him
I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark, dilligently, I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor, I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge have me turn into a mad man, son of sam bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not, you got balls?
We can see how large, when the music stops

[Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
thought money would make me happy, but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you
Dog, and you ain't got nuttin' left but your word and your balls
and you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
when it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends, no girls
just the gin you drink, till your car spin
You think DAMN!
When you slam into the wall, and you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all, in a pool of alcohol, if my funeral's tomorrow
wonder would they even call, when the music stops

[Von]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
when I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of penzoil
I'm revved up, who said what
when lead bust your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
tossed in the paddywagon, braggin' about how you shouted
like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance, understand
I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can hurt me, just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
be smart and stop tryin' to walk how G's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war with your life
fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroner's like, you hype, poppin' shit in broad daylight
nigga you're a gonner at night, when the music stops

[Proof]
Instigators, turn pits in cages
let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk, in the dark, my dogs all bark like woof!
Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof, caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake, the floor tiles loose
the more y'all breath, shit, the more lose moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
put a gun to rap check in all our dues
Nigga, or make the news, betcha all move
when the uzi pop you better drop, when the music stop

[Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
brains confused been fucked since the fifth grade
LL told me rock the bells, NWA said fuck the police, now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B, fucked haircut, listenin' to Jodeci
Michael Jackson who gonna tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset smokin' crack, transvestite in the front
Eddie Murphy in the back
MOP had grimy and gritty, Marilyn Manson, I died my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head I'm goin' in shock
I'm reachin' for the glock, but the music stops {*Bang*}
