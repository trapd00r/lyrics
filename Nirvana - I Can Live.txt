title: About A Girl
albums: Bleach, MTV Unplugged In New York, Nirvana

I need an easy friend
I do... with an ear to lend
I don't think you fit this shoe
I do... won't you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night for free
I do

I'm standing in your line
I do... hope you have the time
I do... pick a number too
I do... keep a date with you

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night for free

I need an easy friend
I do... with an ear to lend
I do... think you fit this shoe
I do... won't you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night [x2]
For free

I do... [x4]
