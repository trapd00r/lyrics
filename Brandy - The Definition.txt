Whoo-whoo
The definition
Real good
Dark Child

I dropped all that baggage
Let go of that habit
The pain you can have it
Now I’m content with me

I’m lovin’ this skin
And I got a good man
Feels like the beginning
Now I’m content with me

It's hard to explain it
Been through it, you name it
The heartache and break
And shame played the game

But I, couldn't seem to win
I started to think
Something was wrong with me
Till I was finally introduced to happy

I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you

The definition, baby it is you
The definition baby you are

I traded that frown in
For me a brand new smile
I’m wearing it proudly
Cuz now I’m content with me

No longer uncertain
I’m sure of the verdict
I’m free and I love it
Cuz now I’m content with me

It's hard to explain it
Been through it, you name it
The heartache and break
And shame played the game

But I, couldn't seem to win
I started to think
Something was wrong with me
Till I was finally introduced to happy

I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you

The definition, baby it is you
The definition baby you are

Cuz I've been digging for years
Barely see pass the tears
Cuz I thought my heart had disappeared

But until you, came into my life
Made me anew, showed me the truth

I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you

I made the greatest discovery of mankind
You define the existence of love
And I found it in you
Searched my whole life through
So rare but so true
The definition of love is you

The definition, baby it is you
The definition, baby it is you
The definition, baby it is you
The definition 

I'm defined by you
