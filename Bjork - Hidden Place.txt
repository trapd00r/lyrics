Through the warmest cord of care
Your love was sent to me
I'm not sure what to do with it
Or where to put it

I'm so close to tear
And so close to simply calling you up
And simply suggesting

We go to that hidden place
That we go to that hidden place
We go to that hidden place
We go to a hidden place

Now, I have been slightly shy
But I can smell a pinch of hope
To almost have allowed once fingers
To stroke
The fingers I was given to touch with
But careful, careful

There lies my passion hidden
There lies my love
I'll hide it under a blanket
Lull it to sleep

I'll keep it in a hidden place
I'll keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place

He's the beautifulest
Fragilest
Still strong
Dark and divine
And the littleness of his movements
Hides himself

He invents a charm
That makes him invisible
Hides in the hair

Can I hide there too?
Hide in the hair of him
Seek solace
Sanctuary

In that hidden place
In a hidden place
In a hidden place
We'll stay in a hidden place
Oh, in a hidden place
We'll live in a hidden place
We'll be in a hidden place
In a hidden place
