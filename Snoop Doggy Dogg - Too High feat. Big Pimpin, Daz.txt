Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and long beach together, now you know you in trouble

Two loced out gs so were craaaaazay!
Death row is the label that paaaaays me!
Unfadable, so please dont try to fade this [hell yeah]

But, uh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so Im a let em understand
From a young gs perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have ta find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin her man,
And learnin her man, and at the same time burnin her man
Now you know I aint wit that shit, lieutenant
Aint no pussy good enough to get burnt while Im up in it
Now thats realer than real-deal holyfield
And now all you hookas and hos know how I feel
Well if its good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
Ill take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

Dr dre:

Well Im peepin, and Im creepin, and Im creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beepin
Now its time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this befo
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some ol funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but dont choke
If ya do, ya have no clue
O what me and my homey snoop dogg came to do

Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Its like that and like this and like that and uh
Its like this, and we aint got no love for those
So jus chill, til the next episode

Snoop:

Fallin back on that ass with a hellified gangsta lean
Gettin funky on the mic like a old batch o collard greens
Its the capital s, oh yes, the fresh n double o p
D o double g y d o double g ya see
Showin much flex when its time to wreck a mic
Pimpin hos and clockin a grip like my name was dolomite
Yeah, and it dont quit
I think they in a mood for some mothafuckin g shit

So dre. [what up dogg? ]
We gotta give em what dey want [whats that, g? ]
We gotta break em off somethin [hell yeah]
And its gotta be bumpin [city of compton!]

Its where it takes place so Im a ask your attention
Mobbin like a mothafucka but I aint lynchin
Droppin the funky shit thats makin the sucka niggaz mumble
When Im on the mic, its like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your assll get smacked
My mothafuckin homie doggy dogg has my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then Im slippin
But if I got my nina, then you know Im straight trippin
And Im a continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if your bitches talk shit, I have ta put the smack down
Yeah, and ya dont stop
I told you Im just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But Im never off, always on, til the break dawn
C o m p t o n, and the city they call long beach
Puttin the strength together
Like my homey d.o.c., no one can do it better

Like this, that and this and uh
Its like that and like this and like that and uh
Its like this, and we aint got no love for those
So jus chill, til the next episode
