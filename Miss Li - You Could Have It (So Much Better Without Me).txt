I want you to know
I've got a handful of trouble in my lonely little trouble soul

No, please don't go
But if you leave I'll understand cause I'm not easy yes I know

Cause I scream without a reason
And I act like you don't please me
And though I am a lucky lady
I throw things around me like a little baby

You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me

I give it up
I'll make it up to you, yes I would do anything to make it stop

Cause boy I need you so
So please please please don't ever let me go

Cause I scream without a reason
And I act like you don't please me
And though I am a lucky lady
I throw things around me like a little baby

You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me

You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me

You could have it so much better without me
You could have it so much better without me

Cause I scream without a reason
And I act like you don't please me
And though I am a lucky lady
I throw things around me like a little baby
