Don't speak to me this way
Don't ever let me say
Don't leave me again
Don't leave me again

Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)

Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)

Don't hurt me this way
Don't touch me this way
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again

Don't hurt me this way
Don't touch me this way
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again

Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)

Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more (more)

Don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
Don't let me make
The same mistake again

Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more

Oh you never felt this lost before
And the world is closing doors
I never wanted anything more

Don't let me make
The same mistake again
Don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
Please don't let me make
The same mistake again
