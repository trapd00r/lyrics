Send "Round Here" Ringtone to your Cell (50 Cent Chorus)
Me I call the shots 'round here,
I say who get shot, who don't get shot 'round here,
I selled coke and caine, pump on the block round' here,
Stick up kids, get they ass got 'round here,
Niggas snitchin', d's comin', it's hot 'round here,
If they run up on one-a-tha spots 'round here,
(Lloyd Banks)
Be on point, its easy to get knocked 'round here,
(50 Cent)
But be smart, you needa have that glock 'round here

(Verse 1 - Tony Yayo)
Yo, I'm on that James Bond shit, that Z3 smokin' that bomb shit, my guns in my armpit
I'm still pitchin' rock and bundles of D, but you can catch me in Hollywood with Pamela Lee (Whoo!)
Yo my team stay rocky kid, in the crib, priced out is as big as Versace crib
You could be D-Zel or Frel, my 9mil, I drive by and do you like the Russians ta Denzel (BL-L-L-LAOW!)

Chorus

(Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks)
They ain't never heard a clique like mine so heavy, so they admire is heavy
clue, you better get them fire trucks ready, cause I am, I'm hot now
I came up quicker, they comparin' me to veterans nigga, and I'm to young to buy liquer
I'm rollin' out till they break a pore of a chip straight, strugglin' baby, I'm on tour of a mixtape (Yea!)
Frontin'l get ya ass done
Nigga, my flows worth mills, like the dress Princess Diana crashed in (AAAAHH!)

Chorus

(Verse 3 - 50 Cent)
Even the old folks in my hood know I stay with a gat, they say "Sabrina baby boy jus don't know how-ta act"
If you gona front that hollow tip leave a hole in ya Jag' (Yea!) big enough to fit a D battery in your back
You call G-unit, Jew-unit the way that money stack
It's a feat for me, Nigga you were payin' for that 
We got artilleries and targets to spit it at, Banks to popin shots, He can sign all your fitted hats 
(BLLAOW!)

Chorus

(50 Cent) 
Yea nigga, you need to have your motherfuckin gun 'round here
Don't be off to see the wizard, motherfucker
Lyin' without a heart
You ain't gonna do nothin' nigga
Don't make me touch somethin' out this muthafucka
Go ahead and act bad nigga, I'm waitin' on these niggas 
Hehehe, you think I'm scared?
O, I'm shakin' in my muthafuckin shoes
I'm scared to death, hahaha
Don't I sound scared? hahaha
