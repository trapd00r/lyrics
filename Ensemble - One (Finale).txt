Send "One Click" Ringtone to your Cell i believed in you that night.
your maybe slightly drunken eyes,
and i won't forget how you smiled
when you were waving me goodbye.
and i thought "if a moment really lasts forever,
we'll take the streets and run off together,
write books by rearranging letters of the few words that we know..."

there was a spark that was there that maybe failed to ignite,
well i saw it in your eyes.
though in context it might have had a different meaning,
i made a pact with myself one time to live with foot in the grave,
and i'm not given up on that dream.
If nothing’s meant to last,
then i refuse to apologize for passion...
that’s giving up, and that seems so... ugh.
