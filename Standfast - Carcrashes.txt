Car crashes, TV shows
A drunkard on the side of the road
People running (running)
Fantasy or reality
Analysis and theories
What does matter really?

Chorus
Tell me what to believe
Won't you bring me order
Tell me what to achieve
Baby, so I can move forward
Tell me what to be
Car crashes, TV shows
A drunkard on the side of the road
People runnin', run

Credit cards in place of distress
Go live your life on the Internet
That's what this is
Conspiracies and mysteries
Science-fiction make-believe
My kind's misery

Chorus x2

Car crashes, TV shows
A drunkard on the side of the road
People runnin' (running)
(All these car crashes in my head)
Fantasy or reality
Analysis and theories
(All these car crashes)
What does matter really?
(All these car crashes)

Chorus x2
