Send "It Doesn't Have to Be This Way" Ringtone to your Cell it doesn't have to be this way
just counting the hours
'cos when your bed it's made 
then baby it's too late

there's no hope for a hungry child
whose joker is wild
they take all hope away 
by the end of the day

well i just about have enough of the sunshine
hey! what did I hear you say?
You know, it doesn't have to be that way!
You! When you walk out the door
You gonna ask for more

It doesn't have to hurt that way
Just counting the pain
You've only got yourself to blame
For playing the game

There's no hope for a hungry child (no wonder!)
Whose joker is wild
And they take all hope 
And I just can't see the sense 
And my mind's a haze

well i just about have enough of the sunshine
hey! what did I hear you say?
You know, it doesn't have to be that way!
You! When you walk out the door
You gonna ask for more

do you want it?
do you want it?
don't you know that i got it baby?
don't you know i got it baby?

And I just about have enough of the sunshine
hey! what did I hear you say?
You know, it doesn't have to be that way!
You! When you walk out the door
You better ask for more
