Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store.

But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...

[Dr. Dre]
Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin conscience

[Eminem]
That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

[Eminem]
Fuck that! Do that shit. Shoot that bitch.
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

[Dr. Dre]
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Not over this shit (Stop!) Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you

[Eminem]
You know what Dre I don't like your attitude!

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old.
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play...

[Eminem]
Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
and smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitches earlobe..

[Dr Dre]
Yo this girls only 15 years old! You shouldn't take advantage of her, thats not fair!

[Eminem]
Yo, look at her bush. Does it got hair? (uhuh)
Fuck this bitch right on that spot there.
'Till she passes out she forgot how she got there.
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?)
No, but I seen the porno thats on nubiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail.

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.


[Dr. Dre]
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..

[Eminem]
Fuck that shit! You just caught this bitch cheatin!
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!
Fuck slittin her throat, cut this bitches HEAD OFF!!!

[Dr. Dre]
Wait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?!)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

[Eminem]
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES??!

[Dr. Dre]
What'chu say? (What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'm gonna kill ya motherfucker!

[Eminem]
Uhhh-aahh! Temper temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aww fuck it what am I sayin'?
Shoot em both Grady, wheres your gun at?
(gun shot, gun cock, gun shot)(music runs out)
