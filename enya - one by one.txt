Here am I
Yet another goodbye!
He says AdiÃ³s, says AdiÃ³s,
And do you know why
She won't break down and cry?
She says AdiÃ³s, says AdiÃ³s, Goodbye. 

One by one my leaves fall.
One by one my tales are told.

It's no lie
She is yearning to fly.
She says AdiÃ³s, says AdiÃ³s,
And now you know why
He's a reason to sigh
She says AdiÃ³s, says AdiÃ³s, Goodbye.

One by one my leaves fall.
One by one my tales are told. 

My, oh my!
She was aiming too high.
He says AdiÃ³s, says AdiÃ³s,
And now you know why
There's no moon in her sky
He says AdiÃ³s, says AdiÃ³s, Goodbye. 
He says AdiÃ³s, says AdiÃ³s, Goodbye. 

No Goodbyes
For love brightens their eyes.
Don't say AdiÃ³s, say AdiÃ³s,
And do you know why
There's a love that won't die?
Don't say AdiÃ³s, say AdiÃ³s, Goodbye.
Don't say AdiÃ³s, say AdiÃ³s, Goodbye.
Don't say AdiÃ³s, say AdiÃ³s, Goodbye.
