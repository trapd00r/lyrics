All fall down, all fall down
All fall down

I used to wake up at night
Feelin' so lonely
Before I knew you really loved me

I used to cry in my sleep
With tears on my pillow
I didn't think you wanted to know

But now you've change my world
I'm wondering how to keep myself from falling over
You're a special boy, my baby
And when you touch me

(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known

(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
You know that you can lead me home

I used to be so unsure
Afraid I'd discover
You want a friend but not a lover

But there's no fear in my mind
'Cause now we're together
Our love keeps growing bigger, be sure

I could jump for joy, you sweet thing
See me walk on air when people staring
They're looking at our mystery
And when, when you smile we

(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known

(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
Wherever you go I'll follow
'Cause you can lead me home

You're makin' me dance, make me sing
Anything, as long as you are here with me
I've found I can't touch the ground
You know you've made my inhibitions
(All fall down)

(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known

(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
You know that you can lead me home

(All fall down)
Happy makes you feel that way
It's takin' me up to the highest
Love I've ever known

(All fall down)
I'm dizzy when I think of you
Wherever you go I'll follow
