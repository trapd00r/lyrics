If I ain't got you, I´ve got nothing at all
Why can't you understand
Just give me a chanse, just give me a call
Just reach me your hand

I´ve got plans for you, I've got plans for me
Gonna take you away
I'll make your dreams come true, just wait and see
Gonna make you stay

I wanna be the one
With you under my shelter
I wanna be the one

I've been watching you for a long long time
Your body makes me blind
I wrote a song for you, hope It's not in vain
You must always stay the same

I wanna be the one
With you under my shelter
I wanna be the one
