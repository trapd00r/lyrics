Send "Sundress" Ringtone to your Cell I might of, gone overboard
I casually broke it off
But I feel so outnumbered
When I'm around you
So I rested up
My soldiers
To make an onslaught
On your castle walls
But you had a force field
And so I fade
And so I fade
And so I fade
And so I fade 

Sit in the dark
So I can be by myself for awhile
Sit in the dark
So I can be up in this world for awhile
When I drop off 
what is there going to be left to see
Except suffocated thoughts
Suffocated thoughts 
Of what you've done to me
Of what you've done to me
Of what you've done to me
Of what you've done to me

Sitting there looking at a portrait
Of the things you've never known
I wear my rage so well
Like a fifteen hundred dollar suit
Like the sketches you showed me
You reminded me of a Spiderman
Weaving a web of insecurity 
On your mother's good sundress
But the rage will fade
Oh yes the rage will fade
And my will fade
And my life will fade

Sit in the dark
So I can hate this world for awhile
I sit in the dark
So I can hate myself for awhile
When I drop off
What is there going to be left to see
Except suffocated thoughts
Suffocated thoughts 
Of what you've done
Of what you've done
Of what you've done to me
Of what you've done to me
Of what you've done to me
Of what you've done to me
