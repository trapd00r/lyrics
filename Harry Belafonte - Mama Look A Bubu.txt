I leave my whole house and home
My children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside de house dey bring
And when I talk they start to sing

"Mama, look at bubu" they shout
Their mother tell them "shut up your mout' "
"That is your daddy", "oh, no"
"My daddy can't be ugly so"
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"

"Mama, look at bubu" dey (ooh)
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"
"Mama, look at bubu" dey 

I couldn't even digest me supper
Due to thee children's behavior
John ("Yes, pa")-"come here a moment"
"Bring de belt, you're much too impudent"
John says it's James who started first
James tells thee story in reverse
I drag my belt from off me waist
You should hear dem screamin' round de place

"Mama, look at bubu" they shout
Their mother tell them "shut up your mout' "
"That is your daddy", "oh, no"
"My daddy can't be ugly so"
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"

"Mama, look at bubu" dey (ooh)
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"
"Mama, look at bubu" dey (oh)
