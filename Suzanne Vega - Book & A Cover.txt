What's that they told you
About a book & a cover? 
Don't judge so quickly,
Is it too much too remember? 
'cause pictures lie,
You know.
I'll show
It's so.
Just give it one thought.

What's that they taught you? 
To revere a kind of beauty? 
To paint on that pretty veneer
And try to hide whatever's dirty? 
Well, faces lie.
You'll see
No sympathy.
Just give it one thought.



Come here and I will whisper true
About the things I know of you,
And you will recognize them,
Always...

As near to you as breath and bone,
So dear to me, and yours alone,
And I will love you for them,
Always...

What's that they tell you
About a book & a cover? 
Don't judge so quickly.
They'll tell you one thing and then another.
But see what lies
Within,
Under the skin.
Just give it one thought.
