Send "Vitamin" Ringtone to your Cell You convince me
That I am able
You make me strong
You're my vitamin
 
 My pain is my pain
 Your cure is vitamins
 
You're my sinking capsule
You're my vitamin...
 
 I look at this pain of mine
 I don't know what it is
 You say I could have it easily
Fixed with some vitamins 
 
Before the hair,
Before the skin,
You form a cell
You're my vitamin
 
 My pain is my pain
 Your cure is vitamins
 If I try some of your pills,
 Won't I have another pain?
 
(Hurrah, hurrah!)
 
 You show me off in all these parties
 So very proud of me
 Telling everybody there that
 I am your little vitamin
 You exit with me (??)
 Like I was somebody
 I am not your cure
To you I'm just another vitamin
 
 I'm so confused
 My pain is mine!
 I don't know what it is 
 You say I can have it easily fixed
 With some vitamins 
 My pain is my pain,
 Your cure is vitamins
 In all these fancy parties
 I won't have another pain 
 As a payment?
 You want all of me 
 'Cause I am your final cure
 
 Use some - show me off!
