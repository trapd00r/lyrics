Warm and cold
You grab me down, you lift me with your magic
New and old
I know your way but I don't understand it
Steel and stone
A thousand years of history and future
Gold and cone
A lazy beam's creating this illusion

I can leave any day
But you're always gonna stay on my mind

Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you
Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you

Sleepless nights
My eyes are open but I must be dreaming
You and I
We play it cool but underneath we're steaming

You can run you can hide
But this roller-coaster ride never stops

Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you
Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you
She's gonna do it to you
She's gonna do it to you...

Ohh...

I can leave any day
But you're always gonna stay on my mind
And you can run you can hide
But this roller-coaster ride never stops

Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you
Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you

Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you
Tokyo
- You've got the rhythm in you
High and low
- She's gonna do it to you
