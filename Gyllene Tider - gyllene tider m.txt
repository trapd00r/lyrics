Twilight, so we meet again tonight
but Twilight, I am all alone this time
I�m comimg back to you, cause I need a place to hide
and you Mr. Twilight, it's just all right
Hey, Mr. Twilight! 

Twilight, ain�t it hard to realize
Hey Twilight, I tell you when I close my eyes
I see a face of a girl that I might
have lost in the twilight, tonight 

Don't give me consolation, I just wanna be on my own
Got no use on persuation, I won't go home
No, Mr. Twilight, I won't go home

Hey Mr. Twilight, tell them Mr. Twilight 

Twilight oh twilight, I've made up my mind and I'll stay
Oh, I see you are dying slowly, fading wave
Please Mr. Twilight, don't go away
