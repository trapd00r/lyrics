eside your light, that reveals my pain.

ever satisfied, but who dares to be,

appy, well it seems not me.

ho struggled for this moment to come.

or love beyond life. 


randmas sight in black coffee

r read my palm, just say that Ill be happy

nd your Kurdish princess

wears you to be true.

ho struggle for this moment to come

ont you know it is in my blood to cry,

or love beyond this life.
