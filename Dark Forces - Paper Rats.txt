Send "Deep Blue Sea" Ringtone to your Cell What can I do with this morning
Dry my tears and move away
When I was with you I saw the dawning
Coming down in the neon lights
And when I'm away I wanna come back
If not I'm freezing cold
I've seen the deal and it's anger
I need someone to bring me home

Cause with you
My sweet darling
Winter's fine alright and I'm in the deep blue sea
Yes with you
My sweet darling
Winter's fine alright and I'm in the deep blue sea

This ship won't sail on forever
The coast will tear it apart
The deep dark forces are near me
They're gonna hit me behind my back
So tonight I give you my gold girl
And everything I have
I'm gonna run for the morning
And let the goodness bring me love

With you
My sweet darling
Winter's fine alright and I'm in the deep blue sea
Yes with you
My sweet darling
Winter's fine alright and I'm in the deep blue sea
