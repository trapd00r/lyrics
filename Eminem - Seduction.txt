Spoken:
I don't know, man. Just feels like, we're a lot different.
Kinda feels like, I'm on a hole different page, right now.
Feels strange, but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...



I feel like I'm morphin'
Into somethin' that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect

Your self-esteem shatters as dialect, comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, so much passion you'd expect, this sort of reaction from her yet
You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop The Don Juan

But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like she's fuckin' with dude, she wants son

Homeboy you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do, how you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes, fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you, than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and your not, aww

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, naw
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up, 'til I get my respect

And I won't stop 'til I get enough 'cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations
Aww, that hater alarm is soundin' off, man, Obama took the bomb from my name, aww
So quit cryin' that I took your dame homie, she's my dame, aww
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy

And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-of-war with your ear, you hear it, girl come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle, that'll wait, am I losin' ya
Am I makin' you look bad, well I got news for ya, homie you're losin' her

Oh wait, you don't like when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow out, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it punk but none of it's fuckin' with me

Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit, you think you killin' them syllables
Quit playin', these beats ain't nuttin to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe struck, she's love stricken
She's got her jaw struck from suckin' my dick, aww fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
