Send "Business (feat. Dr. Dre)" Ringtone to your Cell [Dr Dre]: Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S. 
[Eminem]: Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right! 
[Dr Dre]: To the rap mobile, let's go! 

[Girls]: Marshall! Marshall! 

[Eminem]:
Bitches and Gentleman! 
It's showtime! 
Hurry, hurry, step right up! 
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is... 

[Girls]: Marshall! 

[Eminem]:
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now 
So without further ado, I bring to you... 

[Girls]: Marshall! 

--------------------------
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
You 'bout to witness hip hop in its 
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless 
Most hardest, most honest, known artist 
Chip off the old block but old doc is...
[girls] BACK!
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes (chainsaw sound)
Yeah, here I come 
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none 
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so...

--------------------------
[Chorus] [x2]

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around what is this? 
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down 
On these clowns, can I get a witness? 

[Dr Dre]: Hell Yeah! 

--------------------------
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles 
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables 
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham 
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals 
So, skip to ya lou, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it was till everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs 
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up 
There's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans 
It just means so much more to so much more 
People when you rappin' and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll 
To Marshall and Andre's carnival 
C'mon! Now... 

--------------------------
[Chorus]

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around what is this? 
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down 
On these clowns, can I get a witness? 

[Dr Dre]: Hell Yeah!

--------------------------
[Verse 3]
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo 
Two old friends, why panic? 
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes 
Dial straight down the center 800
You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette 
And neva even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat 
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely 
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy 
Jesus, how can shit be so easy 
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me 
Believe me, BET and MTV 
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo sheezy 
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me 
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains 
Nothin' but clowns down here 
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here 

[Eminem]: Yo Dre! 
[Dr Dre]: Whuddup? 
[Eminem]: Can I get a hell yeah? 
[Dr Dre]: Hell Yeah! 

--------------------------
[Chorus] [x2]

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around what is this? 
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down 
On these clowns, can I get a witness? 

[Dr Dre]: Hell Yeah!

[Outro]

[Eminem]: So there you have it folks 
[Girls]: Marshall! 

[Eminem]:

Back with his friend Andre 
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because 

[Girls]: Marshall! 

[Eminem]:
And Andre are here to stay and neva go away 
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray

Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming 
Your host for the evening
