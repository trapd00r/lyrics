First floor, room sixteen
Smells like danger (let's go), even better (let's go) 
Set your goals, bless our souls 
I'm in trouble (yes, I know), but it feels like heaven

You were like one of those guys 
The kind with the wandering eyes 
But I said, hey, what the hell
Once in my life I'll take a ride on the wild side

You were so full of yourself 
But, damn, were you cute as well 
You liked my legs, I liked your moves 
Anyone could tell, not a heart could deny that

Did it again, love, I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right, I can't believe it 
And all the mistakes that went on for too long 
Wish there was a way I could delete it

Second night in a row
I'm back in trouble (let's go), I don't get it (let's go) 
Gotta keep it down, 'cause it'll all be cold
But we ignore them (yes, I know), 'cause it's getting better

When it comes to men, it's known 
That I end up choosing wrong 
'Cause I always trip and fall 
On the same old rock and repeat and go back

How blind a girl can be 
To miss you hide your ring 
Lied about everything, I'm so naive 
And I should have known that

Did it again, love, I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right, I can't believe it 
And all the mistakes that went on for too long 
Wish there was a way I could delete it

It may seem to you that I am in a place 
Where I'm losing the direction of my life 
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase 
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

It may seem to you that I am in a place 
Where I'm losing the direction of my life 
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase 
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

Did it again, love, I got it all wrong 
But it felt so right, I can't believe it 
And all the mistakes that went on for too long 
Wish there was a way I could delete it

Did it again, love, I got it all wrong
