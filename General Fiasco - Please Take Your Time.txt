Send "Please Take Your Time" Ringtone to your Cell Slowly I'm here changing nothing,
going backwards,
Yeah lets go back to the start again...
As they told it, we're still losing
Can't quite grasp it,
Can't quite get enough of you.

Well please take your time with me
Lost unfocused my mind takes over
I'm just a ghost now my mouth has let me down again
Now you've seen it
Throw shame over
That's my secret, I hope you get the best of it.

Well please take your time with me
Well please take your time with me

Slowly I'm here changing nothing 
Going backwards
Lets go back to the start again
As they told us, were still losing
Can't quite grasp it
Can't quite get enough of you

Well please take your time with me
