[Intro - Eminem]
Remix [echoes]
Lloyd Banks! [echoes]
Ha ha! [echoes]

[Verse 1 - Eminem]
It's like a throne that he dont even own
He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold dont want the jewelry
He dont want the ring although he's only in it for the sport
Runnin suckaz round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it
And you can love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it
You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The story of a Warrior i know u know it
tru Warriors go ahead and make some noise
it aint healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
hit ur corner wit my Weapon i dont need my boyz
im doin about 120 in the Fast Lane
kick back just relax let me do my thang
dont Give a Fuck about you suckas gotta maintain
Money Power and respect in this rap game 

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
He's straight out of a neighborhood but Niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate
And he hops in a 100 thousand with a Nigga's skate
Houses with a bigger gate ,houndin hims a big mistake
He wont surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break
Cuz he remembers when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand
So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name
When you discussing the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them
G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I no U Kno It
Tru Warriors Go Ahead and Make Some Noise
It aint healthy To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid
Hit Ur Corner Wit My Weapon I Dont Need My Boyz
Im Doin About 120 in The Fast Lane
Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang
Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain
Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent]
Hes no magician man
the kid make sumetin outta nuttin 
So now niggaz from his hood act like he owe em somethin
They talk crazy til he send niggaz to ready to buck him
Ask 'em if its a problem and he'll say naw its nothin
He's was gonna help em out, but since they frontin, fuck em
He dont care how they feel they can hatem or love em
He hold his all on his own the kid is really thuggin
He's rich now, he aint change so Niggaz think he buggin
He bulletproof everything case Niggaz try to bust him
Keep 2 pistols on his hip I'll show you where he tuck em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they cant touch him
Try to catch him slippin, they creepin he start bustin

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I no U Kno It
Tru Warriors Go Ahead and Make Some Noise
It aint healthy To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid
Hit Ur Corner Wit My Weapon I Dont Need My Boyz
Im Doin About 120 in The Fast Lane
Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang
Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain

[Nate Dogg]
I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn ur smile upside down
You ain't no G Unit fuckin' clown
I can take your girl until until I turn her out
Dont Hold it in let it all out
I can give you fuckas somethin' to be mad about
And buy her rings and I back out
With my DNA all in her mouth
