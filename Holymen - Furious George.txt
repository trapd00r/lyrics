without a sense of fear, i'll try to walk this life.
try to reflect what i feel on the inside.
you hold a blatent misinterpretation of a simpler day,
but the only thing they know about me is my name.
i accept that our perceptions on the same ideals will probably never be the same.

(throughout these trying days, my passion stays the same.
and i won't waste a chance to grow)
with everything i've ever learnt, 
i'll ensure that every second here is a second earnt.
(everything i've learnt from these failures, light the road.)

i can feel assumptions cloud around us.
but what i've come to realize, is that it doesn't mean anything.
despite this all, our goals remain the same.
it seems i'm cutting them out and it's to set them straight.

intervention, a misdirection.
so we're all looking the other way.
but your sons are waking up, and they aren't afraid to have their say.
we can't arrive with reason if our irrational fears will block our way.

(throughout these trying days, my passion stays the same.
and i won't waste a chance to grow.)
with everything i've ever learnt, 
i'll ensure that every second here is a second earnt.
(everything i've learnt from these failures, light the road.)
who else but i, will decide when my pride is to set alight.
