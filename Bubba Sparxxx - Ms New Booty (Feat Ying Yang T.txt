(feat. Ying Yang Twins)

(Intro: Collipark, Bubba Sparxxx)

(Chorus (Ying Yang Twins)
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere (3x)
Rockin' everywhere (2x)

(Bubba Sparxxx)
I found you MS NEW BOOTY
Get it together and bring it back to me
Hit the dance floor for about month or 2
Put his hand on it then see what he do (2x)

Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight (3x)

(1st verse (Bubba Sparxxx)
Girl I don't need you, but chu need me
Take it off, let if flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell stories, I let em tell theyself
And you aint gotta sell sex, girl, it sells itself, Like nothing else
Yeah I'm a country boy, but that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Aint life grand (life's grand) livin up daddy
Here go da whisper song, baby this is us ready?
Put it on me enthusiastically, what ever it is that chu do, you do it admirably
And I aint choose it, that thang chose me
Its bubba and ying yang, all the way in this thang
YO!

(Chorus (Ying Yang Twins)
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere (3x)
Rockin' everywhere (2x)

Hit the playas club for about month or 2
Put his hand on it then see what he do (2x)

Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight (3x)

(3rd Verse (Bubba Sparxxx)
hi there, how are things?
I once was breast man now it seems
Ever since I had the pleasure
of getting you together, your chest is just whatever
I found the buried treasured
Yes ma'am, heres the plan
Meet me over yonder ok- don't play
Ill bring the whip whoop, you bring your cook book
And ima fix that stuff up, everything is good good

(Chorus (Ying Yang Twins)
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere (3x)
Rockin' everywhere (2x)
