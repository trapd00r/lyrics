Send "Don't Let Go" Ringtone to your Cell First of all I apologise for this long period of silence. 
Being busy is no excuse to pull away and lose touch with my friends. 
Last time we met on the net, 
maybe you didn't like those things that I said 
But the day I sent you that sad mail, not one, not two but 3 couples of friends just split up 
[chorus]
[Please don't start your reply with 'sorry I was busy too', 
It's the busyness that brings us to our knees 
Who invented all these things we have to do? 
cause if I don't have you babe? 
what I'm trying to say is don't let go.] 

And as for me, the snow's returned 
The cat is scratching at cotton buds on his fur 
Mum never calls. Laura's going to Spain. 
The ethics teacher killed herself last Saturday 

Please don't start your reply with 'sorry I was busy too' 
I know you're busy we are all busy 
We've got such important things to do
