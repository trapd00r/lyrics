So your lying in your underwear
Oh, in Someone Else's Bed
& the silence is so dangerous
It's a terrible sense of dread.

So I have another cigarette
& I just try to forget.
How did I end up all alone?
How did we all end up dead?

Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I believe I've seen the end of it all
Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I've got the cure for it all.

& my dirty little secret
Has a wretched little name
In the filthy morning after
I have walked the walk of shame.

Oh & you'll be the end of me
As I have been the death of you
& I quite enjoy your suffering
Oh, I want to watch the view.

Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I believe I've seen the end of it all
Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I've got the cure for it all.

Are you there when I'm ready to top myself?
Are you there when I'm all alone?
Do you even know why I am suffering?
Are you down to your bones?
Are you down to your bones?
Are you down to your bones?

Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
I believe I've seen the end of it all
Sunday morning when the rain begins to fall
It's the end of the world.

I never said I would try for you.
I never said I would die for you.
I never said I would try for you.
I never said I would die for you.
