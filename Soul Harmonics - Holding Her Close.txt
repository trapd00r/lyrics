Send "He Can Only Hold Her (P-Nut demo)" Ringtone to your Cell He can only hold her for so long 
The lights are on but noone's home 
She's so vacant Her soul is taken 
He is what she's running from 
How can he have her heart 
When it got stole 
Though he tries to pacify her 
Whats inside her never dies 
Even if she's content in his warmth 
She gets pained with urgency 
Urgent kisses 
The miss misses 
The man that he longs to be 
Now how can he have her heart 
When it got stole 
So he tries to pass it by 
Cause what's inside'll never die 
As he tries to pacify her 
Cause whats inside her never dies
