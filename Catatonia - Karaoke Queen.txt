Tedium is overcome
From obscurity, through melody
And when I'm blind it helps me
See through your key

No one can touch, no need to rush
Presented by my alibi
When I'm down it brings me round
So easily

At eight o'clock, I take my leave
And when I'm done and dusted
Tonight I'm gonna be

I'll be a karaoke queen, it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a three minute song
It doesn't last very long
But it'll take you to a place I know you'd rather be

Hey you can dance
Oooh sha la la la la la la

Common sense has excuses
Recklessness, its uses
But don't go fusing silence with charisma

At nine o'clock you can count on me
And when I'm up I'm ready
Tonight I'm gonna be

I'll be a karaoke queen, it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a three minute song
It doesn't last very long
But it'll take you to a place I know you'd rather be

Where you can dance

I'm doomed to fail
The stage gives way
It's an apostrophe to my legacy
But though I'm bruised
I'll happily do it all again

At 10 o'clock don't wait up for me
Coz when I'm up I'm ready
Tonight I'm gonna be
Matthew!

I'll be a karaoke queen, it's not me you see
I'm gonna take you down to a place
I know you'd rather be
It's just a three minute song
It doesn't last very long
But it'll take you to a place I know you'd rather be

And you an dance if you want to
Show appreciation
But step up to the mic for the full sensation

And you can dance
And you can dance
And you can dance
And you can ooh la la la ooh sha la la la

And you can ooh la la la ooh sha la la la
