Send "Freak Out" Ringtone to your Cell I think we should jump on the piano
No one's looking we could tear his heart out
It's too late to save us now but no matter
We still have time to dance
So let's dance

& freak out

I think we should rip a hole
Right through the center of this house
It's time to tear it down
Our chance to smoke him out
It's too late to save us now but no matter
We still have time to dance
So let's dance

& freak out

It's time to put off all our hesitation
& get up on the floor
'Cause I am gonna laugh ha ha ha hey
When you do that dance
& freak out
Come on freak out
Freak out
