All around the world you go
All around the world you go
All around the world you go
The more you go the less you know, hey baby
Youâll never stand a chance
All youâre lookinâ for is somebody to feed you
All youâre lookinâ for is something in the air
All youâre gettinâ is some trash to breathe
The more you leave the more we love you, baby
Why should you stand a chance?
All that you love, all that you need
You came in for kix
All that you love, all that you need
You came in for kix 
Youâre a super accident
Youâre a major accident
Everybodyâs tryinâ to pay the rent
- âOut she went!â
Itâs heaven sent, hey baby
Youâll never understand
All that you love, all that you need
You came in for kix
Youâre workinâ so hard on your demand
Itâs all about kix 
Itâs not that funny, is it?
Itâs not that funny, is it?
Itâs not that funnyâ¦funnyâ¦ 
All that you love, all that you need
You came in for kix
Youâre workinâ so hard on your demand
Itâs all about kix 
All that you love, all that you dig
You came in for kix
Itâs all in your head
Itâs all in your blood
Itâs all about kix
