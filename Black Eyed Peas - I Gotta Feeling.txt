I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (Ooo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (Ooo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (feel)

Tonight's the night
Let's live it up
I got my money
Let's spend it up (feel)

Go out and smash it
Like, oh my God!
Jump off that sofa
Let's get-get... off (feel)

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out
And just lose it all (feel)

I feel stressed and
I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out
And losing all control (feel)

Fill up my cup
Mazel tov
Look at her dancin'
Just take it... off (feel)

Let's paint the town
We'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof
And then we'll do it again (feel)

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it, and do it, and do it
Let's live it up (feel)

And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it (feel)

'Cause I gotta feeling (Ooo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (Ooo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (feel)

Tonight's the night (Hey!)
Let's live it up (Let's live it up!)
I got my money (I'm paid!)
Let's spend it up (Let's spend it up!) (feel)

Go out and smash it (Smash it!)
Like, oh my God! (Like, oh my God!)
Jump off that sofa (Come on!)
Let's get - get... off (feel)

Fill up my cup (Drink!)
Mazel tov (L'chaim!)
Look at her dancing (Move it! Move it!)
Just take it... off (feel)

Let's paint the town (Paint the town!)
We'll shut it down (Shut it down!)
Let's burn the roof (Woooo!)
And then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it (Let's do it!)
Let's do it, and do it (Do it!), and do it
Let's live it up (feel)

And do it (Do it!), and do it (And do it!), and do it (and), do it (and), do it (And do it!)
Let's do it (And do it), let's do it (And do it), let's do it (Hey!), do it (Hey!), do it (Hey!), do it

Here we come, here we go
We gotta rock (Rock, rock, rock, rock)

Easy come, easy go
Now we on top (Top, top, top, top) (feel)

Feel the shot, body rock
Rock it, don't stop (Stop, stop, stop, stop)

Round and round, up and down
Around the clock (Clock, clock, clock, clock) (feel)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (Do it!)
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday (Do it!) (feel)

Get-get-get-get-get with us
You know what we say (say)
Party every day
P-p-p-party every day (feel)

And I'm feeling (Ooo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (feel)

A feeling (Ooo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night (feel)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

Ooo-hoo!
