Send "A Moment Forever" Ringtone to your Cell Keep it up my baby don't go don't leave it on top
Keep it up my baby don't go don't do it on top
Keep it on my baby so c'mon let the bubble go pop
Keep it up my baby don't go don't leave it on top

Ohh Yeah!

See all the lovers walk hand in hand in the park
and hide all the action
one couple frozen and bondage forever more
with chains around the ankles
standing like statues, so lucky to see them here
and feeling their presence
their love for each other was taken away by force
for ages and ages

be silent wherever they go
cos their moment´s forever
be silent wherever they dance

Their story goes on that they're moving away by thoughts
from city to city
showing that love can't be killed even after dark, 
and after a death
dancing with shadows so lucky to see them here
and feeling their presence
the chain around my ankles rattling their mellow song forever and ever

be silent wherever they go
cos their moment´s forever
be silent wherever they dance ooooh!
a bow for the couple that shows 
that their moment´s forever
be silent wherever they dance

Keep it up my baby don't go don't leave it on top
Keep it up my baby don't go don't do it on top
Keep it on my baby so c'mon let the bubble go pop
Keep it up my baby don't go don't leave it on top

be silent wherever they go
cos their moment´s forever
be silent whenever they dance ooooh!
a bow for the couple that shows that their moment´s forever
be silent wherever they dance
