Send "Till I'm Gone" Ringtone to your Cell [Verse 1]
I gave him love
I gave my all
I gave myself, I lost control
Held nothing back, I just let go
Now, I'm realizing, I've been all alone

[Hook]
He won't love me
Till I'm gone
But I don't want him
'Cause he's wrong wrong
Now he love me, 'cause I'm gone
But it's just too late
'Cause now I found someone

[Verse 2]
I'm looking
For an everlasting love
The kind that every girl dreams of
But every time you said you love me
Boy you lied
Now all I have for you
is goodbye

[Hook]
[Bridge]
Lord tell him something
'Cause he lost his mind
If I could rewind
I wouldn't give him the time
I'll take all this pain
And throw all away
But I realize
You ain't good enough for me

[Hook (Repeat out)]
