RUN
(Peter Kvint)
Yeah, oh yeah
Cheap thrills and messing around
Youve been busy
Letting her down
Put on a show
Never try to tell the truth
You had it all
You threw it away
How could you know there would be a day
When shed give up
And turn her back on you
Boy, you better run
And tell her that this story has just begun
Tell her that no matter what youve done
She is still the only one
Oh, boy you better run
Cause shes gonna run from you
Now shes saying that its time to move on
Before you know it she will be gone
You better hurry
Better try to make things right
Oh, its about time that you realize
She wont see the tears in your eyes
No, she aint gonna know about the way you miss her now
Boy, you better run
And tell her that this story has just begun
Tell her that no matter what youve done
She is still the only one
Oh, boy you better run
Cause shes gonna run from you
I tell myself its a different story
Tell myself theres no need to worry
Now I know that I got to hurry
I aint going to make it stop
Until Ive made it up to her
Shes still the only one
Oh, boy, youve got to run
No matter where youve been
Its nothing but a sin
Stop acting like a fool
Stop trying playing cool
Boy, you better run
Boy, you better run
And tell her that this story has just begun
Tell her that no matter what youve done
She is still the only one
Oh, boy you better run
Cause shes gonna run from you
