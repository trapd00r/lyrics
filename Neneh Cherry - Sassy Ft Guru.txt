So sassy...
So sassy...

Fellas got to give me the most respect
Cause you know I don't like to waste my time
So don't give me that
I'm laying down I syzzle slow
I might be tripping but I do my thing
I play the games like monkey in the middle - not -
Piece by piece like a puzzle we come together

Guru...

"You never seen a girl like this before
Because she's so sassy completely secure
Check out the way she walks and talks
She got the force to knock it out the box
Now I know this lady for some time
Yes of course she's fine
The only one of her kind - buss it
The lady has so much pazzaz if you step
To her wrong you're getting played the jazz"

Conversations
Don't say the most 
Along the way I've heard some boasting

I roll my dice and take what comes
Numbers, numbers, numbers
As I hang with my chums
I count my lucky days - cause I know when they come
If you're looking for a ride boy watch me run 
All the way to China
Or just between peace and man

"On yes she's nifty-hefty 
The beat plays on
She's bout to rip the roof from
Dusk to dawn
So when you see lady for must give her props
Keep the champagne floran???
Until the music stop
I'm man of my time she's a woman of hers to
Old fashioned but still stashing a few
New styles for roughneck rude
So I'm gonna stuff it in your face like gourmet food. "

And hooked like a picture and look to the wall
And hanging like Picasso seems so tall
Voluptous I had a choice to be monagomous
Me and my baby forgot to check what day it was
Under the covers kissing the way it was
Freshly squeezed so pure and natural
unique in character and this is factual.

So sassy...
So sassy...
