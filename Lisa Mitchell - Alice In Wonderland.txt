Sometimes I feel like alice
In a wonderland chasing rabits
Cheshire cats and mad hatters
A better world well it don't really matter

Well day breaks and life is as dark as the room
The air is laced with sweet perfume
What is it about morning light
That makes everything feel alright

Alright

Well it feels like I have just woke up
In a world where down is up
And up is a long way from here
In the big wheels where they keep on turning
They don't slow down they just keep on learning

Well my name's not Alice but I know how she felt 
When her world started turning into something else

Sometimes I feel Alice
In the Queen's alluring palace
Got the playing cards on my track
Like a twisted game of blackjack

Because it feels like I have just woke up
In a world where down is up 
And up is a long way from here
In the big wheels where they keep on turning
They don't slow down they just keep on learning

Well my name's not Alice but I know how she felt 
When her world started turning into something else

Well sometimes I feel like Alice

Oh my name's not Alice but I know how she felt 
When her world started turning into something else

No my name's not Alice but I know how she felt 
When her world started turning into something else

Well it feels like I have just woke up
In a world where down is up 
And up is a long way from here
