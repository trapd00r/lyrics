You were in the city,
one night all alone
Waiting for a taxi
that could take you home
You swa a man walking
down the street, towards you
And you could see he had no teeth
in his upper jaw
He had dirt in his hair,
he had dirt everywhere
His clothes didn't fit, (His clothes looked like shit, 1995 swedish release)
and one eye was hit
He asked you if you had
a minute to talk
You said you didn't talk to strangers
and you started to walk

His eyes looked sad
and he asked you why
you acted like this,
was it because he looked so bad
I know I scare you,
but I just wanted to say
that you're the most beautiful,
I've seen today

You said
Thank you very much
but pleace now
leave me alone
He said where are you going
You said
I'm going home
Oh pleace would you invite me
to your house sometime
you have just seen mine,
it's here on tha ground

He took a bottle from his jacket
and he said cheers
And you felt it was gone,
that feeling of fear
You said
what happened to you,
how could you
end up like this
You must have had your choices,
so tell me what this is

He said
you don't know a thing about me
All you know is only what you see
Even if I've lost the most
of my brain
I still can see the sun and I can feel
when it rains

I tried to be friendly,
I tried to be nice
But you turned me your back and
you were as chilly as ice
I didn't ask you for money,
I asked you for words
It's not my life that bothers,
it's the way you act that hurts

You said you were sorry,
but how could you know
what someone like him,
suddenly could do
But then you talked
until the taxi arrived
You said you had to go,
you said goodnight

There's only one thing
I wanna tell you
before you go
I know you wanna get home
I know you do
I just wanted to tell you,
I just wanted to say
That I'll remember
with a smile this day
