"There's a point in time where you can't think for yourself"
...Paulie shots!

I'm placeable,
Listen to the dreams you're dreaming
Untraceable, tell me now what are you scheming?
I'm placeable, to the place where you most fear
Untraceable, so help me dear...

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm placeable, innate, yet surely substantial
To repay, you fade away
Sweetness smells so sweet, I, your feet
Just to repay your fade away...

I'm placeable, I have no place now
Untraceable, to your jaded vows
I'm placeable, no more of your face
I'm placeable, so help me please...

[Pre-Chorus]...
[Chorus 1]:
Kill the man, become the monster  (x4)
You are... One sick inividual
You are... So sincere
[Chorus 2]:
I'm the one, get under your beds,
Increase your dreams, and you know it well
Yeah, I'm the one, get under your beds,
Increase your dreams, and I know it well, Hell...

I'm placeable, recognize that you're most favored
Untraceable, tell me now, what are we made of?
I'm placeable, to the place where you most fear
Untraceable, so help me dear...

[Pre-Chorus]  /  [Chorus 1]   /   [Chorus 2]

Kill, the man... become, the monster... (x3)
...[Chorus 1 (x2)]  ...So sincere
