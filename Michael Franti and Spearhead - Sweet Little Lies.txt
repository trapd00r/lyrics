chorus
You tell me lies, lies, lies
Sweet little lies
When I cannot bear the truth

You tell me lies, lies, lies
Sweet little lies
Help me make them all come true

Tell me that the rain won't fall today
Tell me that the taxman lost his way
Tell me that the hurtin ain't gonna hurt no more
Tell me that somebody stopped the war

[chorus]
I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Tell me that the whole world's wonderful
Tell me that the bank account's still full
Tell me that we all got plenty of time
Tell me that I ain't gonna lose my mind (lift me up now)

[chorus]

and you know I'm just a man
with my heart in my hand
you tell me things and hope
and ghosts won't leave me alone
and even though I got no plans
I'm on the run from the man
and just hold on to me
you just hold on to me

Every time I need a prayer
Every time I need to share
Every time I needed someone to hold on to me

[chorus]
help me make them all come true
help me make them all come true
help me make them all come true
help me make them all come true
help me make them all come true

spoken: tell me that the whole world's wonderful
