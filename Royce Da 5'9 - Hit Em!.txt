Intro [DJ Premier speaking]:
Yo Royce. The gloves is on? Don't play around with these motherfuckers. It's time to...

[Royce] (Statik Selektah)
Hit 'em. (It's the Bar Exam)
Hit 'em. (Royce Da 5'9")
Hit 'em.
Go

Verse One:
5'9" stand back he about to blow
Snatch your hoe, let her go she about to blow
That fo fo that he's holdin' is about to blow
I thought I told you motherfuckers it's over
Bliiiiiiip
Stick up
I got the gats out grindin'
Give me any kinda Preme track I rap out rhymin'
And bliiiiiip
Switch up, turnaround and rap bout diamonds
Tell the underground I'm shinin'
I'll be back I promise
What you lookin' at dog?
Your boy is fire
The more time goes by his nose gets higher
Plus he been pushin' that bar
He knows what he wants
He'll fuck a Pussycat Doll before he retires
It's all about black and white
It's like a piano
The white and black cards you dealt 
Life is a gamble
You might rap hard today like you an animal
Then suddenly, tomorrow you gay, like The Sopranos
I done seen it all
Lyrical niggas who dumb it
Down 
For y'all niggas to sing along and still do nothin'
You simple like the ABC's, is y'all countin'?
You like a caption at the bottom, with the ball bouncin'

Chorus:
5'9" stand back he about to blow
Snatch your hoe, let her go she about to blow
That fo fo that he's holdin' is about to blow
Preme tell 'em who it is just so that they know

"Royce Da 5'9" - DJ Premier
Hit 'em
"Just a young nigga caught in the mix" - dead prez
Hit 'em
"It's rugged and underground"
Hit 'em
"You can't run no games" - Xzibit
Go!

Verse Two:
5'9" crystal clear
Pistol in here
You disappear and soon as I shoot it if you appear
You see it clear if I appear to be clutchin' a shottie
The butt on the gun is bigger than Buffy The Bodys
I go upside your head with it and fuck up the party
Oooh, I make your ass loose those couple Bacardis
The 40 long came along with a couple of bodies
I know a couple Corrleones, a couple of Gottis
My story long nigga, I stay deep in the drama
I get my Maury on nigga and sleep with ya momma
I done did wifes, did dimes
Did niggas in when the tripped 
Cause they found out the kids mines
Blew the tec off
Drew the column up on who the best 
Put himself, Nas, Jay on it and moved the rest off
I'm a +Gang+sta as well as a +Star+
Put 'em together and you caught me pickin' up where Guru left off

Chorus
