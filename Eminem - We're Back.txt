(feat. Stat Quo, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater & Ca$his) 

[Eminem:] 
Nothing Can Stop And Nothing Can Change 
And You Better Just Make New Livin' Arrangments 
If You Think, You The Top And King Of The Castle 
You About To Be Thrown Off The Throne And Ripped A New Asshole 
All I Hear Is I'm The Best At This And I'm Best At That 
But I Don't Hear My Name, No ?? Brought Up In Rap 
And I Don't Usually Trip Or Damn Get Caught Up In That 
But When They Say One Of The Best, I'm Nowhere Thought Up As That 
Not Even The Same Leage As Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie Or Maybe 
The Name Me Somewhere Down At The Bottom, Right After Az 
Or Say He Ripped That Biggie Verse, Or That Jay-Z 
Yo His Verses Were Crazy, On That Renegade Beat 
But I Ain't Never Bought No Whole Cd Of Shady 
And All I Hear Is Pop Tunes Come On The Radi-O 
And They Play Em 20 Times In A Row Daily 
And They Very Well Maybe 
The Same Reason They Don't Say Me 
When They Speak On Hip-Hop Legends Which Is Amaze Me 
Cause I Thought The Formula Was To Hit Mainstream 
And Make It Big Ba Big Big Bay Ba Baby 

[Obie Trice:] 
So Maybe The Eighties Made Me Crazy 
I've Been Tryin To Get My Weight Up Since The Ace Slim Shady 
Gave Me The Gate Key, Paved The Way 
So Lately, My Stakes Get Better Each Day 
Replay My Relay Race, When I Was Chasin The Afee At Eighteen 
Eight Years Later His Voice In Beijing 
No Choice I Chase Cream, So 

[Eminem:] Shaaaddyyy, (Stat Quo!) We're Back! 

[Stat Quo:] 
This Is What I Eat, Sleep And Breath And Feed My Kids 
Would It Fulfill All My Family Needs (C'mon) 
I Treat The Mic Like The Block 
Fuck With My Rocks, And Squeeze 
Critics Expecting Me To Underachieve 
I Just Deal With The Hate I Recieve 
By Rolling Back My Sleeves 
Sure Was A Breeze, I Bring Him Right To His Knees 
And Tell Him Suck My Dick
I Take A Bow And Leave 
With A Sack Full Of Unmarked Cheese 
I Find It Hard To Believe 
Who To Pull Or Proceed 
To Be G's And Claim They Runnin Shit 
Nigga I Run Me 
As A Kid, Teacher Said I Had A Mouth On Me 
The Same Mouth Got Me The Deal With Dre And E 
Folk In The Hood Be Askin, Where I Be 
Dogg, I'm Out In Hawaii 
Don't Like It? Drink My Pee 
Record Song For The Detox Lp 
Feet Don't Fail He 
Niggas Got Me Bent Like Cranberry And Belvee 
I'ma Die Wealthy 
Boss In The Game, What The Fuck They Gon Tell Me? 
A Towns Auntre, Aftermath, Shaady! 

[Eminem:] Shaaaddyyy, (Bobby Creek!) We're Back! 

[Bobby Creekwater:] 
Y'all Market Y'all Block, They Sent Me To Corner That 
Rap Game's An Old Flame, My Nigga I Want 'em Back 
Like Mic Check, 
Pimp For What It's Worth I Got The Right Net 
Sittin' Here Excited By Some Shit That Aint Right Yet 
No Regret, Live By A Code You Don't Know Bout 
Y'all Niggas Won't Be Certified Till I Show I 
Go Out On A Limb With Em Cause I'm Wid Him 
Put A Barrel To The Apparel Of You And Some Of Them 
Stand A Chance, At The Dance, Without A Bow Tie 
Shady Records Re-Introduce You Niggas To Mow-Ti 
So High, Of The Light That They Have Given Me 
And The Haters Like A Shofurr Because It's Driven Me 
To A View With A Vendetta I Am The Apitomee 
I Don't Give A Fuck About Ya Nigga I'm Just Livin Me 
We The Reason For The Season So I'm Breezin Through The Track 
Nigga 

[Eminem:] Shaaaddyyy, (Cashis!) 

[Cashis:] 
I Can Prove I'm Here To Do Something You Never Do 
From Hand To Hand Coke Sales, From My Revenue 
I Aint Been Toa Function, Where I Ain't Snuck A Weapon Through 
Cause My Background Reveals A One Eight Seven Too 
To The Block, I'm The Truth 
To The Cops, I'm The Proof Of This 
And Niggas Still Out There, You Just Gotta Shoot 
I Carry Over My Street Ethics, To The Booth 
And The Shady Crime Fam, Al Capone In His Youth 
The Difference Between Me And You, I Already Done It 
And Lived The Street Life, Niggas Run Away From If 
You Follow My Life, In A Midwest Blunted 
Pitchforks Held High, Four Fifth By The Stomach 
You Can Find Me Right Now, On The C.A. Streets 
I'm On The Roof, Of The Building, Shooting At Police 
Some Of The Homies Feel Opposition Can't Kill Me 
I'm A Walking Obituary, Death Live In Me 
I Take Life Through The Pen, By The Way I'ma See 
Or Have You Raped In The Pen, Like American Meat 
I'm Connected Gettin Weight From Ms 13 
With S.K's, A.R's And Mini Fourteens 
I'm Cashis, The Last Of The Real, With A Strap 
On Pro-Sac, D's And E-Pills, It's A Rap 
Get The Block On Tip, Two For Tens Of Crack 
I'm In A Lifetime Contract, Shady's Back 
Nigga
