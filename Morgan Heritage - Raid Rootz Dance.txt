(intro)
"Everything is still everything means, no matter how your day is rough, no matter how people talk about you, you just, that phrase's like "Everything is still everything", you don't let what people say get you down, or, try to go with fags, and, and, and, what's, you know, popular, you just go with, you know, what's in your heart, and what you wanna be, don't try to be like nobody else, just be yourself, don't worry about, you know, if the day is rough, eventually it's gonna evolve in shine bright like the sun, so.. Everything is still everything."
Selassie!
- Now, Switzerland, we want everybody to dance to this ska music. 
Ayeyeye Put on your dancing shoes and dance, 
Aha ha haaaaa ha haaaa!
if you're up or down with a smile
If you sma not to walk around 
Everything

Now if a soldier say a soldier say, 
Everything is gotta go Jah way


If you find out your friend ain't really your friend


If your day starts good, and everything goes like it should,


But, if a soldier say a soldier say

Everyday something new 

Switzerland, 


First attempt! ;)
