Don't you cry, baby blue
Didn't want to be a dream
Just a kiss in the dark
It will break your heart in two
Just a girl, just a night
Come on, babe, that's all right
And so, my sweet,
Don't you cry, don't you argue
Don't you fight
What's so bad, what's so mean
Didn't want to spoil your dream
Baby, don't you run away
Never change the way we did
What's a kiss, what's a night
Well, I'm sorry if that fright
You and me, that's okay
Let's go fighting for the light
Final heartbreak killed my dream
Feeling the pain that made me scream
You love me, so it seemed
But your love was too extreme
Final heartbreak made me cry
Bridges are burning in the night
You made my feelings die
But there ain't complain inside
So, goodbye
Baby, please, take my hand
Just forgive me if you can
It's so human as you know
And what's more, I'm just a man
I won't see her again
I don't even know her name
Don't you say it's a shame
Loving you is not the same
What's so bad, what's so mean
Didn't want to spoil your dream
Baby, don't you run away
Never change the way we did
What's a kiss, what's a night
Well, I'm sorry if that fright
You and me, that's okay
Let's go fighting for the light
[chorus]
Don't you cry, baby blue
Didn't want to be a dream
Just a kiss in the dark
It will break your heart in two
Just a girl, just a night
Come on, babe, that's all right
And so, my sweet,
Don't you cry, don't you argue
Don't you fight
What's so bad, what's so mean
Didn't want to spoil your dream
Baby, don't you run away
Never change the way we did
What's a kiss, what's a night
Well, I'm sorry if that fright
You and me, that's okay
Let's go fighting for the light
[chorus]
