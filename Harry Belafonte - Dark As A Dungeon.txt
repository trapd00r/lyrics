Come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine
Itâll form as a habit itâll seed in your soul
Till the blood in your veins runs black as the coal

For itâs dark as a dungeon and itâs damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
Oh God itâs dark as a dungeon way down in the mines

Oh itâs many a man Iâve known in my day
Who lived just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend for his dope a drunkard his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

Oh I hope when I die and the ages do roll
Yes my body will harden and turn into coal
And I look from the door of my heavenly home
To see a poor miner a digginâ my bones
