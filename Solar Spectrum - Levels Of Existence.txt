A grief of missing understanding
A lot of knowledge ain't of use
A wisdom earned by lifetime spent
Says too much, thinking in abuse

Committed sins have dual power
For those who's able to be taught

Unsure in every single action
Attempting to please everyone
The one who gets no conformation
Of inner "Him" who shines like sun

Complaints about life's deprivations
Make colors pale, existence dim
And there is much more devastating
As long as we just let them be

Chorus:
Conduct my obsession
Caress my beliefs
Perverted disproportions
I'm eager to seek
