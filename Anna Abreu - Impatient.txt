You say you listen but you never do.

you say we're fine but im in this too
you fall asleep and im still awake

i wish you would understund

you're like a rock that i would like to break
or like a coctail that i have to shake

you make me sad when im happy
i wish you could understund

still i go weak when you just look at me
(so dont look at me)

youre such a creep but still you make me feel
( so dont make me feel)

Let me love im impatient 

or cut me loose and let me be free

cause you're the one who's holding the key

i know you love me but it feels untrue

sometimes a wall between me and you

am i a dreamer or am i fool

i've got thing about you

still i go weak when you just look at me
(so dont look at me)

youre such a creep but still you make me feel

( so dont make me feel)
Let me love im impatient
 
 or cut me loose and let me be free

cause you're the one who's holding the key

still i go weak when you just look at me
(so dont look at me)

youre such a creep but still you make me feel

( so dont make me feel)

Let me love im impatient
 
or cut me loose and let me be free

cause you're the one who's holding the key

i'm torn apart so stop dragging my heart around

oh, how i wish that you would undestund

still i go weak when you just look at me
(so dont look at me)

youre such a creep but still you make me feel
( so dont make me feel)

Let me love im impatient 

or cut me loose and let me be free

cause you're the one who's holding the key

still i go weak when you just look at me
(so dont look at me)

youre such a creep but still you make me feel
( so dont make me feel)

Let me love im impatient 

or cut me loose and let me be free

cause you're the one who's holding the key

cause you're the one who's holding the key
