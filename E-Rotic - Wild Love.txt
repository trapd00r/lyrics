I'm in the mood to love so warm and tender
If you want me, I'll make sure heart surrender
Killing you gently, kiss with such a thrill deep inside
Stay here tonight
You make my heart a temple of desire
I want your love, so, baby, light my fire
Just feel my body and you know I need you right now
I need you now
I'm looking for a wild love, streams of fire
Running through my veins
Drive me mad and joy my fantasy
I'm looking for a wild love, waves of passion
Driving me insane
Please try, please try to set me free
Tonight I'm free, but, babe, you can not sleep
And when I'm hurt, just take my hand and seek
At sudden we can get rebow a part of the night
So hold me tight
I'm of love and strong it gets me going
Come close to me, the winds have changed of blowing
Just hold my body, and you feel I need you right now
I need you now
[chorus]
I'm in the mood to love so warm and tender
If you want me, I'll make sure heart surrender
Killing you gently, kiss with such a thrill deep inside
Stay here tonight
You make my heart a temple of desire
I want your love, so, baby, light my fire
Just feel my body, and you know I need you right now
I need you now
[chorus]
