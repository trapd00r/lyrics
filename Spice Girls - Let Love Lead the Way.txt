What makes this world go round
Will the answer let her down
She is so sweet and young
And her life has just begun

What does her future hold
That's a story left unknown

Will she make it through her days
Let her Love lead the way

Part of me laughs
(oooooh)
Part of me cries
Part of me wants to question why
(Question why)
Why is there joy
Why is there pain
Why is there sunshine and the rain
One day you're here
Next you are gone
No matter what we must go on
Just keep the faith and
Let Love Lead the Way

Everything will work out fine
if you let love
Let Love lead the way

Sitting there all alone
in the window of her room
Watching the world go by
brings tears to her eyes

All she sees is hurt and pain
She wants to brake the chain

She'll keep pressing every day
and she'll find her own sweet way

Part of me laughs
(Me laughs and)
Part of me cries
(I cry)
Part of me wants to question why
(Question why)
Why is there joy
Why is there pain
Why is there sunshine and the rain
One day you're here
(You're here)
Next day you're gone
(You're gone)

No matter what we must go on
(I will go on)
Just keep the faith and
(Keep the faith)
Let Love lead the way

I know I know I know I know

You can be all bad
And still can be who you are
You've got to know for sure
That it isn't make believe

You may feel weak
But you are strong
Don't you give up

If you keep holding on
You'll never be wrong
Just close youre eyes cos it lies
Deep in your heart

Yeah

Part of me laughs
Part of me cries
(I cry)
Part of me wants to question why
(Question why)
Why is there joy
Why is there pain
Why is there sunshine and the rain
One day you're here
(you're here)
Next you are gone
no matter what
We must go on
(We must)
Just keep the faith and
Let love lead the way
(lead the way)

Every thing will work out fine if you let love
let love lead the way

Love lead the way
