Send "Big Weenie" Ringtone to your Cell [Intro]
I don't understand..
Why are you bein so mean!?
You're a MEAN, MEAN MAN!

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it 
You walk around and say

All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be 
'So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie 

Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of a sort
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment

Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes - close em'
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next 4 and a half minutes 
We are going to explore into your mind 

To find out why you're so fuckin jealous
Now why do they make you who
Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo 
Syke, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're still listening

Ok now I need your un-divided attention 
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this, 
Undeniable tension from the moment I enter into the room? 

It gets all quiet and whispers 
Whenever there's conversations why am I always mentioned?
I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me 
Is it just because... 

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it 
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be 
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie 

Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremly important 
But I forgot who or what it was
I fucked up, 

Syke, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didin't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I FUCKED up ain't it?
That I could bust one take 

Without lookin at no paper 
It doesn't take a bunch of takes 
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth ok

You're drooling, you have tooth decay
You're mouth is open, 
You're disgusting 
What the fuck you eat for lunch, 

A bunch of sweets or somethin 
What you munch a bunch of crunch-a-munch?
You're tooth is rottin through the gum
Your breath stinks,

Want to chew some gum?
[Yes I do sir what am I on?]
You sir are on truth serum
[Marshall I'm so jealous of you

Please say you won't tell nobody 
I'd be so embarrassed 
I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out

Why I'm saying all these terrible, evil, and awful 
Mean things, is my own insecurities!!]

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it 
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be 
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie 

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like
When he takes 2 hits of exctasy

'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like
Want to check to see? Here's a mirror 
Notice the resemblance here? 
Wait let me put these sun glasses on

Now look in this mirror, how bout' now
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em'
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies

Now take my weenie out of your mouth 
This is between me and you 
I know you're not happy,
I know you'd much rather see me lying

In the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind dying
There's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is 

Mine is like stickin a banana between 2 oranges
Why are you even doin this to yourself?
It's pointless,
Why do we have to keep on going through this?

This is torturous 
My point is this, that if you say mean things,
You're weenie will shrink 
Now I forgot what the chorus is.. you're just a...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it 
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be 
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie 

Fuck off my dick
