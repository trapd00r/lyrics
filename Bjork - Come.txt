Send "Come To Me" Ringtone to your Cell come to me
i'll take care of you
protect you
calm, calm down
you're exhausted
come lay down
you don't have to explain : i understand

you know : that i adore you
you know : that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm

jump off
your building is on fire
i'll catch you : i'll catch you
destroy all that is keeping you down
and then i'll nurse you : i'll nurse you

you know : that i adore you
you know : that i love you
so don't make me say it
it would burst the bubble
break the charm
