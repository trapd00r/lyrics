Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, come fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In Lama land there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come on fly with me, let's float down in the blue

Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, come fly away

Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
Come fly with me, let's fly away
