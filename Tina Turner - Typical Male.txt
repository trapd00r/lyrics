Tell me lawyer what to do 
I think I'm falling in love with you 
Defend me from the way I feel 
Won't you give me some advice 
On how to handle my private life 
I'm sure we can make a deal 
I confess I'm a fool for men with a clever mind 
But your intellect ain't no match with this heart of mine 

 All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male 

 Your sense of justice I'll embrace 
But your defence don't help my case 
I'm deep in trouble with the law 
Something about authority 
Seems to bring out the bad in me 
Hey lawyer gotta catch me when I fall 
Oh they say that you match your wits with the best of them 
But I know when I'm close you're just like the rest of them 

 All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male 

 So put your books aside 
Loosen off the suit and tie 
Gotta open up your heart and let me in 
Open up your heart and let me in
 Send "Typical Male" Ringtone to your Cell
