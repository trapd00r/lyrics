Why is it so hard to believe 
That we're living in a world of dreams 
We don't deny what our love means now 
So I know, truth is just an illusion 

There'll be no more lies 
If we don't deny 
What our love means now 
There'll be no more lies 

No more, no-no-no more (7x) 
There'll be no more lies 
If we don't deny 
What our love means now 

There'll be no more lies 
There'll be no more lies 
If we don't deny 
What our love means now 
There'll be no more lies
