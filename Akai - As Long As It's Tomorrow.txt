Send "Greenest of Stages" Ringtone to your Cell I'm afraid in your greenest of stages
You misplayed this
You have done things wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

I'm afraid in your greenest of stages
You misplayed this
You have done things wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

Humility will benift the ages
You misplayed this
And it will cause your fall
Fall, fall, fall

I'm afraid in your greenest of stages
You misplayed this
You have done things wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

Everything is smaller than anyone sees
And now the universe is closing in on me

Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up
Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up

Everything is smaller than anyone sees
And now the universe is closing in on me

Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up
Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up

I'm afraid in your greenest of stages
You misplayed this
You have done things wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

And all the older guys
Are so homogenized
Into a pale imitation
Of what they were before
For, for, for

And those who stayed the course
Is leaving no remorse
But that was long ago
And it's time to move things on
On, on, on

I'm afraid in your greenest of stages
You misplayed this
You have done things wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

Everything is smaller than anyone sees
And now the universe is closing in on me

Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up
Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up

Everything is smaller than anyone sees
And now the universe is closing in on me

Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up
Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up

It took a long time before I spoke
One day you close your eyes and it's tomorrow
It took a long time when I decided not to wait until tomorrow
And I say this to you

I'm afraid in your greenest of stages
You misplayed this
You have done things wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

And I have read of your plans
To take this to higher places
And I wish you well
Well, well, well

But there's a flaw
In your lack of planning
Or understanding
And now it won't be long
Long, long, long

I'm afraid in your greenest of stages
You misplayed this
You have done things wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong

Everything is smaller than anyone sees
And now the universe is closing in on me

Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up
Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up

Everything is smaller than anyone sees
And now the universe is closing in on me

Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up
Put up, put up, put up, put up or shut up

It's getting dark out
It's getting so dark out
It leaves you open
It's never quite this late

It's been a long time
It's been a long long time
Since I have spoken
Well, I have used my mouth

It's getting dark out
It's getting so dark out
It leaves you open
It's never quite this late

It's been a long time
It's been a long long time
Since I have spoken
Well, I have used my mouth
