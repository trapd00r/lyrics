Hahahaha

Eminem:
It's shit like this, I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Whoops I did it again didn't I, my shit's
Harder to figure out, than what Britneys tit size is (Wooooo)

I probably pissed you off again, didn't I bitch? (So what)
You and Christina Gaguilera, kiss my grits
You know how many shits I give, I wish I did
So I could quit givin' these twisted little kids ideas

This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked, how come I can't, shit 
God damn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this 

Are those pictures I made of us, together on the internet
As close as I'm ever gonna get, to hittin' it from the back
Shit, when it comes to that, I hit harder from the back
Than Everlast, when he's pluggin' DJ Lethal in his fuckin' ass

Just gimme one more chance, Britney hit me one more time 
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is 
Fuck your jewelery, my records almost diamond bitch 

What's goin' on in the world today
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's OK
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Ray (It ain't nuttin' but music)

Bizarre:
Eminem doesn't like *NSYNC, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too (Yea I said it)
Whatever happened to the cast of different strokes
Gary's broke, Todd snort coke, and Dana overdosed (Aww)

I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me (Hee-hee)
I'm up early with my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furley, fuckin' Lavern and Shirley

Kuniva:
A lot of rappers are livin' in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men *woof woof woof*
As bad as the life I had, I'm not mad
And I don't need to be a jackass, to beat up my dad *punch punch punch*

My whole family's country
My grandmothers oldfashioned, she keeps askin' me why I rap with a honky
But granny I'm a flunky, I could be a junkie
I could be hangin' with the hoochies out at the club scene

Kon Artis
So all the indpendent women in the house (house)
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin' mouths

Proof
Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston, the shit shes usin'
Jesse Jackson, reverend scandals, got George Michael, Tevin Campbell
Pee-wee Hermans, peep show places, public restrooms, beat those cases

What's goin' on in the world today
People fightin', feudin', lootin', it's OK
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Ray (It ain't nuttin' but music)

Swifty
Your mom and dad probably mad at us (for what?)
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
They like where I'm from (uh huh), we don't bite our tongue (yea)
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns (blah blah blah)

It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme 
When you work, you ain't gettin' paid for that overtime (damn)
it's only music, media know it, but they blind (that's right)
i ain't in ur life so stay the hell up outta mine (nigga)

And you're the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin'
you people get offended, I don't care, stop cryin'
tryin' to get us to leave, 'cuz what we say just ain't playin 
but holdin' me back from what I say just ain't me 

Kon Artis
now whats these parents so mad for? 
(ur music is bad) for teenage kids who drink more than ted danson in cheers 
carson drinks beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch (shut up) 
(poor or rich) I still do the same old shit, 
I dont jump infront of a camera and say no shit 
when they ask me about my sarcastic-ness 
I just slap them, turn around and ask them this 

(chorus) 
(Eminem)
La La, La
La La La La, La
