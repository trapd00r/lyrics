[50 Cent]
(When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down)
This is what it sounds like when I'm breakin' it down
(Yeah I'm breakin' it down)
Man this is what it feels like, when I'm breakin' it down
(When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down)
It's not my fault (c'mon)
It's not fault (I'm hot man!)
It's not my fault (c'mon)
It's not my fault

Till the sun comes up, every night (c'mon)
We party and we party 'til daylight
We be gettin' it in come on we gettin' it in
A lil' Hennessey, a lil' juice and gin
It's not a fantasy, it's not pretend
We gon' do it, we gon' do it, we gon' do it again
Till the sun comes up, every night
We party and we party 'til daylight

I shouldn't have to tell you shorty you should know (yeah)
I'm really been lookin' into yo' freak show (ah ha)
You gimme a little baby and I'ma want mo'
O.D.B. said that I like it raaaw!
Exotic her body been movin' on the flo' (whoo)
Enough to make a nigga lose control (yeah)
I'm down to go wherever you wan' go
Ya got a man now keep it on the low
I do my thing you know I gets my dough
I got a few s*tacks me and you can blow
We get into the hotel after the show
I know how to romance ya, be my private dancer, yeah

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
On ya mark, get set girl, now here we go
Racin' off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it, girl you turn me on (ha ha)
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down

[50 Cent]
They say I'm not the same it's 'cause I'm filthy mayne
I'm off the chain I don't play no games
I'm hustlin' hard homie I do my thang
You f**k wit' the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips
I'm tryna get her in my bedroom and shit
We can take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord the s*hit make a boom-boom flick
It's oh so many places that we can go
I really want you shorty shorty now you should know
Girl ya body's callin' me hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now we can do it right here

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
On ya mark, get set girl, now here we go

Racin' off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it, girl you turn me on (ha ha)
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down

The way you move (the way you move)
You make me lose (you make me lose)
Of control (of control)
I know you know (I know you know)

You're so seductive, you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell ya, you know I wanna f**k ya
I'm feelin' your style ya better watch me now
My tongue'll be in ya mouth my hands'll be in ya blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have ya I'ma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
On ya mark, get set girl, now here we go
Racin' off to see yo' peep show
It turn me on to see you on the flo'
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down
Ready or not shorty now here I come
Shake that thing girl now back it up
Work it, work it, girl you turn me on (ha ha)
When ya breakin' it down, keep breakin' it down

It's not my fault (c'mon)
It's not my fault, I can break it down
It's not my fault (c'mon)
It's not my fault, can ya break it down?
It's not my fault (c'mon)
It's not my fault, I can break it down
It's not my fault (c'mon)
