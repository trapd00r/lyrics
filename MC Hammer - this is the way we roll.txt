Send "This Is the Way We Roll" Ringtone to your Cell Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm rolling on
This is the way we roll, we roll
This is the way we roll

Yeah, yeah, rolling
Rolling, I'm rolling

Sounds like one of those funky
M.C. Hammer cuts to me money
Yeah, that's what it sounds like, yo
This is one of those records
When the fellas get on the floor
And say baby yea I'm all that

Down the highway
I'm doing it all my way
Money in my pocket (Yo)
I'll say it feels good
That I got it like that
My top dropped
Her hand is in my lap (my lap)

Alpine kickin' another selection
The girlies keep lookin' in my direction
My tank is full
My fame is strong
I got it like that
So I'm rollin' on... 

This is the way we roll
We roll... We roll
This is the way we roll... Rollin'
(Rollin'... Rollin'... I'm rollin' on)
This is the way we roll
We roll... We roll
This is the way we roll... Rollin'
(Rollin'... Rollin'
All through Oaktown I'm rollin' on)

This is the way we roll
We roll... We roll
This is the way we roll... Rollin'
(Rollin'... Rollin'... I'm rollin' on)
This is the way we roll
We roll... We roll
This is the way we roll... Rollin'
(You left turn there's high street)

Gotta keep my business straight
My mobile phone rings yo
I think great (great) good news
And I'm happy as Gilligan

Big Lou say we just hit ten million (ten million)
Thinking back to when I first got started
A lotta M.C.'s yo
They brokenhearted (That's their business)
I don't sweat it because my game is strong
I got it like that so I'm rollin' on

This is the way we roll
We roll... We roll
This is the way we roll... Rollin'
(I'm rollin', I'm rollin' on
I'm rollin', I'm rollin' on
Rollin' rollin' I'm rollin' on... 

Yo! Take me to the bridge (We're rollin')
Now let's show them how
A real posse breaks it down

Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
(You can't stop us we're rollin'
You can't stop us we're rollin'...)

Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'

[Backthe BRIDGE]
(I feel it... I feel it...)

When you break it down this time
You better break it down
I'm rollin' on... 

This is the way we roll
We roll... We roll
This is the way we roll... Rollin'

Five years of hippin' and a hoppin'
'87 Is when the Hammer started poppin' (poppin')
Got strong and now I'm stronger
The ladies love a man who can last longer (longer)

Feels good that I'm holding my own
Ducking the sticks and dodging the stones (they throw)
Dis me but never dismiss me 'cause the Hammer is strong
So I'm rollin' on

Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
To the bridge (it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky...)
You know right about now J.B.
Would probably holler (HOOOO!...)

But sometimes I feel like the Godfather

[To the BRIDGE]

(Can't stop us don't try to stop us
We're rollin'... Hey oh
We're rollin'... We're rollin'
Hey we're rollin' on...)

Yo! Burrell can we make it funky
You see had to slip my
Cousin name in there
You know what I'm saying
That ain't me, that's Jimmy Burrell
You know he gets cousin propers on that one

I'm rollin'

Pass the loser who only can talk
About what they're going to do
Don't you know that I walk (walk)
To a rhythm they'll never understand
The rhythm of a Hammer beatin'
Down on a man's Mind, spirit for oh so long

We're moving up (yeah) movin' on (movin' on)
To a place where our mind runs free
You be you and I'll be me... rollin' on!... 

Now I want the whole posse to
Ake me to the bridge... (we're rollin'...)
Now everybody inthe house break it down... 

Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
(You can't stop us we're rollin'
You can't stop us we're rollin'...)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'

Here it is! All right now
We're gettin' ready to do something real fun
I want to see everybody do that jump... Is dese you?
(Don't you know we're rollin'?...) I'm rollin' on! 

Rollin', rollin', I'm rollin' on
Rollin', rollin', I'm rollin' on! 
Rollin', rollin', I'm rollin' on
Rollin', rollin', 
(I'm rollin', I'm rollin' on
I'm rollin', I'm rollin' on)
I'm rollin' on!... Rollin', rollin'... 
I'm rollin' on!... Yo
Everybody in the house
I'm rollin' on!... Rollin'... Rollin'... 
(You can't stop us... Oh no
Don't you know we're rollin') I'm rollin' on!...
