Here at the party,
Everyone's happy,
Everyone's high.
Get struck by lightning 
Who here would feel it?
Who here could heal it?
Who here would try?

CHORUS:
Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
You're just too high to see the point,
You think your name is 'pass the joint'.

I think I like you,
But you like this whole room,
You sexy machine.
I’m jing-a-linging,
From here to the ceiling.
Inside I’m reeling,
So fresh and so clean.

CHORUS:
Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
You're just too high to see the point,
You think your name is 'pass the joint'.

You're still too amazing to ignore,
But I'm incapable of rescuing you.
You find it too damn easy to get bored,
That's why you're always trying something new.
And then when you can't hold up,
They're all over you,
Flies on cake, flies on cake...

CHORUS:
Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
You're just too high to see the point,
You think your name is 'pass the joint'.

Chemical party, lover down...
It's not the walls, it's not this town.
I'm just too drunk to make my point,
But you think your name is 'pass the joint'.
Oh you think your name is pass the...
Lalalalalalalala
