If the sun shuts down and decided not to shine no more
I would still have you, baby
If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war
I'll be fighting with you, baby

Cos I know if I'm falling
You won't let me hit the ground
If the boat is sinking
I know you won't let me drown

No matter what anyone could say
This is the only place for me
And no one could ever take that away
Nothing could come between us

If the sun shuts down and decided not to shine no more (No more)
I would still have you, you, you ,you, you, you, you
If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war (To War)
I'll be fighting with you, you, you ,you, you
Because it's us against the world
The world, the world
You know it's us against the world
The world, the world, ohh

Now if I'm lost at sea 7 days I'm not alone
If I'm holding you, you, you, you, you
And if it all ends, everybody in the world is gone
I'll be standing with you, baby

And if it's the last breath I take
I'll leave my cares with you
If there's a wall between us, baby
I know I'll break through

No matter what anyone could say
This is the only place for me
And no one could ever take that away
Nothing could come between us, no-oh

If the sun shuts down and decided not to shine no more (No more)
I would still have you, you, you ,you, you, you, you
If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war (To War)
I'll be fighting with you, you, you ,you, you
Because it's us against the world

Nothing's stronger now than you and I
Cos your love is all I got
And this we're never gonna stop,
No, whoa
There's no distance here when we're apart
Come on in from the cold
Lay your head on my shoulder
Ride like a soldier
I'ma stay right here

If the sun shuts down and decided not to shine no more (No more)
I would still have you, you, you ,you, you, you, you
If we see the last day and they say we gotta go to war (To War)
I'll be fighting with you, you, you ,you, you
Because it's us against the world
The world, the world
You know it's us against the world
The world, the world

Because it's us against the world
The world, the world
You know it's us against the world
The world, the world

Because it's us against the world
The world, the world
You know it's us against the world
The world, the world, oh
