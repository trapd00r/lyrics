As usual, I'm in a tricky predicament
Weather in my thoughts, on the roof sneaking a cigarette
Dear California, it's been nice to know ya
Tell me, will you miss me when I'm gone?
 
'Cause he loves me as I leave, so I'm gonna go
And I'm not in companies when you feel it most
And you keep my memory, hope ya keep me close
Would you love me as I leave?
 
This alchemy is making me suspicious
As if I slipped you some belladonna
That I crossed town to get, don't you know?
Yes, my grand friend checks it
 
Oh he loves me as I leave, so I'm gonna go
And I'm not in companies when you feel it the most
And you keep my memory, hope ya keep me close
Would you love me as I leave?

Ever-changing as the sea, it's my only hope
It's just me and my pup in the open road
But your face is like a paper-cut to the heart
Slip away while you sleep
 
It's easy, it's easier
 
Than it seems
It's easy, it's easier
Than it seems
 
Just go, I'll go, don't cry
I don't know, I don't know, but you fly
(Hey!)
Paper-cut to the heart
 
Oh he loves me as I leave, so I'm gonna go
And I'm not in companies when you feel it most
And you keep my memory, hope ya keep me close
Would you love me as I leave?

Ever-changing as the sea
Would you love me as I leave?
Dear California
Would you love me as I leave?
Dear California
Would you love me as I leave?
Dear California
Would you love me as I leave?
Dear California
