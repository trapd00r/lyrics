I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

See the morning sun, see the morning sun
On the hillside
If you're not living good
You gotta travel wide, you gotta travel wide

Said I'm a living man, said I'm a living man
And I've got, I've got work to do, ooh
If you're not happy, then you must be blue
You must be blue, people say

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

See a morning sun
On the hillside
If you're not living good, I beg you
Travel wide, travel wide

Said I'm a, said I'm a, said I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, if you're not happy
Then you must be blue, must be blue, you must be blue

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
