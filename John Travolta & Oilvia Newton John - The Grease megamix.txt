Why its a Grease Lightning (Grease lightning)

I got chills they're multiplying
And I'm losing control
Cause the power you're supplying
It's electrifying

You better shape coz I need a man 
And my heart is set on you 
You better shape up 
You better,to my heart I must be true

You're the one that I want 
The one that I need 
Oh yes indeed

Why it's a Grease lightning (grease lightning)
We'll get some overhead lifters 
And some four barrel quads oh yeah
(keep talking whoa keep talking)
Fuel injection cutoffs and crome plated rods oh yeah
(I'll get the money I'll kill to get the money)

With a four speed on the floor they'll be waiting at the door
You know that I ain't braggin she's a real pussy wagon
Grease Lightning
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Go Grease Lightning you're burning up the quarter mile
Grease lightning go grease lightning
Go grease lightning you're coasting through the hit lap trial
Grease lightning go grease lightning
You are supreme the chicks'll cream for greae lightning
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Summer loving had me a blast
Summer loving happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be
Summer days drifting a way to oh oh the summer night

Tell me more, tell me more 
Did you get very far?
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car?

She swam by me she got a cramp
He ran by me got my suit damp
I saved her life she nearly drown
He showed off splashing around
Summer sun somethings begun but oh oh the summer nights

Tell me more tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more tell me more
Did she put up a fight?

It turned colder that's where it ends
So I told her we'd still be friends
Then we made our true love vow
Wonder what she's doing now
Summer dreams ripped at the seams but oh those summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
