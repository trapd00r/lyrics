Hey this life is never fair
The angels that you need are never there
oh but, sometimes he comes to me
in the dead of winter dead of night
hes all that i can see

Hold on to me ahh ahh
Hold on to me  ahh ahh
hold on to me, yeah eh yeAh
hold on to me

We all get our Glory
our little bit of fame
but theres no truth at the heart of any of it
just the brilliance and the passion and the bitterness remainds

He brings me down
Oh, down into the ground
I never will get ah-ya ah-ya ya-out
Hush your highness don't you breath
No, baby hold me in your arms i'm shivering
But whats all this for, 
If i was the battle baby you have won the war

I'll protect you from the night, it will never fall
I'll protect you from the truth, won't hear it at all
I am the center of the universe, yeah i am the truth
and i'm the pain that you feel, yeah i felt it for you
I am the center of the universe
I am the center of the universe

When youre in the whirlpool, and they try to suck you in
remember you aren't gonna die until you are out of life
and when you think youre drowning baby i could always swim

Oh, how he brings me down
Oh, down into the ground
I never will get ahya ah-ya ya-out
I never will get ahya ah-ya ya-out
Hush your highness don't you leave
No baby hold me in your arms I'm shivering
But whats all that for
If i was the battle baby you
and If i was the battle baby you
if i was the battle baby you have won the war
