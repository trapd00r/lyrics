Send "We Are All Made of Stars (Downtempo)" Ringtone to your Cell Growing in numbers 
growing in speed
can't fight the future
can't fight what i see
People they come together
people they fall apart
no one can stop us now 
'cause we are all made of stars
Efforts of lovers
left in my mind
i sing in the reaches
we'll see what we find 
People they come together
people they fall apart
no one can stop us now 
'cause we are all made of stars
People they come together
people they fall apart
no one can stop us now 
'cause we are all made of stars
Slow slow slow, come come
someone come come come
even love is goin' 'round 
you can't ignore what is goin' 'round
Slowly rebuilding 
i feel it in me 
growing in numbers
growing in peace
People they come together
people they fall apart
no one can stop us now 
'cause we are all made of stars
People they come together
people they fall apart
no one can stop us now 
'cause we are all made of stars
People they come together
(people they come together)
people they fall apart
(people they fall apart)
no one can stop us now 
(no one can stop us now)
'cause we are all made of stars
(we are all made of stars)
We are all made of stars
people they come together
we are all made of stars
(people they fall apart)
we are all made of stars
(no one can stop us now)
'cause we are all made of stars
(we are all made of stars)
