When I feel all alone
And nobody knows
Still got a smile for awhile
I can't let it show
Dry my tears, hide my fears

And when I'm backstage feeling down
And the lights come on
No time to worry
Gotta Hurry, Gotta sing my song
Gotta shake it off, and strike a pose
Here I go

Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want, just cause I want it

I'm super cool, super hot
Livin' like a rock star
You think I'm super
You think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super, I'm super duper
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super super, to be super super girl

When I walk in the room
Everybody stops
Cameras Flashing, people fighting
For the best shot
They like my hair, the clothes I wear
Everybody wants to know what I'm doing next
Sometimes I wish I could stay home
Just be by myself
I wanna be more carefree
Can't you see
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that
Don't get what I want, just cause I want it

I'm super cool, super hot
Livin' like a rock star
You think I'm super
You think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super, I'm super duper
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems
To be super super, to be super super girl

Wish you could see
I'm like everybody else
Struggling to let go
And always be myself

I'm super cool, super hot
Super, I'm super super, super super

On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super, I'm super super
So you wanna be just like
So you wanna be just like
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watching me
It's never as easy as it seems

To be super super, to be super super girl.
