Send "How Could I Forget?" Ringtone to your Cell introverted boy 
you are not interesting, boy 
you think you're intellectual 
but no one's talking to you now

I might be an introvert 
to you, a shallow fashionista
deep as any paper plate
dressed just like the girl beside you

how could I forget 
a waste of cloth
of course, I do remember
on the back deck drunk and awkward
I think we accidently met

I know you've got some place to get to
and I really got to get somewhere
remember when I said 
that Vincent had some tickets for me there

how could I forget 
a waste of breath
of course, I do remember
all the things you said were pointless
now you go on dropping names
