Mitsumeteta awai negai o egaki
Naze furueteiru? kodoku o kakae shounen wa seiten no sora ni nanimonai koto no imi o

Naze ni rinen wa haru haruka tooi yakusoku no koe mou kikoe yashinaisa

Nagare katachi o kaete yuki kieru ima mo kokoro ubaware

Yaketsuku kusari no ato urabureta koe koko ni hitori

Naze ni rinen wa haru haruka tooi yakusoku no koe mou kikoe yashinaisa

This is my pledge to you

Mada umaku ikirarenai no sa kaerareru no wa tada ...

Ashita ni ikasarete mo nanimo kawaru hazu no nai hibi mada owarenai

Komiageru kokoro ga mada saku no nara kotae te miro yo

Dare mo iyase yashinai


Drawing the vague meeting that he had been watching
Why is he trembling? From the feeling that rises up, the boy
Shoots arrows of sound in the changing sky

Why is the regret still running?
Somewhere far away the voice of a promise
It cannot be heard it anymore.

Still guessing shapes, it disappears
Even now, his heart is taken away and the scars from the chain burned on
The voice that I had hated Here, alone

Why is the regret still running?
Somewhere far away the voice of a promise
It cannot be heard it anymore.

This is my pledge to you

I still can't live well.
What I can change is only--

Even if tomorrow forces me to live
My days will not change
I can't say it anymore

If you are going to rip up
The voice and the dreams that I build up, then answer me
No one will be forgiven
But it can't be said. It can't be said. It can't be said.
