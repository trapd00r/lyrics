I have been given 
one moment from heaven 
as I am walking 
surrounded by night, 
Stars high above me 
make a wish under moonlight.

On my way home 
I remember 
only good days. 
On my way home 
I remember all the best days. 


I'm on my way home 
I can remember 
every new day. 

I move in silence 
with each step taken, 
snow falling round me 
like angels in flight, 
Far in the distance 
is my wish under moonlight.
