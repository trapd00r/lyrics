If you see me walking down the street
Staring at the sky
And dragging my two feet
You just pass me by
It still makes me cry
But you can make me whole again

And If you see me with another man
Laughin and jokin
doing what I can
I Won't put you down
Cuz i want you around
You can make me whole again

(Chorus)
Looking back on when we first met
I can not escape and i can not forget
Baby you're the one, you still turn me on
You can make me whole again
Time is layin' heavy on my heart
Seems I've got too much of it
Since we've been apart
My friends make me smile
If only for while
You can make me whole again

(Chorus)
Lookin' back on when we first met
I can not escape and I can not forget
Baby you're the one, you still turn me on
You can make me whole again

For now I'll have to wait
But baby if you change your mind
Don't be too late
Cause I just can't go on
It's already been too long
But you could make me whole again

(Chorus)
Lookin' back on when we first met
I can not escape and I can not forget
Baby you're the one, you still turn me on
You can make me whole again
(repeat and fade)
