Look out the window and drank and chill out we get high!
It's 1 A.M. and the crowd is still live
Relax to the groove by me just move with ya' boy
Got shit poppin' like always you know so enjoy
Dont make yourself at home got big meat on the grill
Ladies and homies all in the mix its time to chill
Char-La-La brought the on' what is asked in the blunts
Roll up some Bob Marley joints some skunk datz tight
And Nate got a hundred piece
So we piece so properly on the O.C.
We in the zone bombed out feelin' good j'ya know
Got the homegirls and homies from the hood j'ya know
2-1, 1-9, 2-0
We all in the house and it's a Long Beach thang
Where I was born and hungout
To all my players and hustlers and gangbangers listen up
It's about time I kick a rhyme to fuck shit up
Now who throws shit?

Now the party is bumpin', thumpin' back to back
And Daz on the turntable puttin' down a scratch
I'm on the mic so I'ma bust me a rap
And I'm a dedicate this one to a crack of hoodrats
The Dogg Pound nation Lex and Big Pac-sy
These is the peoples I see rockin' the party
Ever they go gonna pop-lock on the flo'
Well do the Boogaloo shrimp and pimp the ho
I got to owe em' my life cuz I'm a O.G.
I got the love in the hood cuz I'm livin' homie
I got the seals when it comes to rockin rhymes
So put ya fists up to the side it's yours I got mines
Now everything is live dont you agree?
And if you do then he gon' move it with the nigga D-O-Double G
We ridin' with the hat to the side when we ride
Ya'll know how we do on the Eastside
You see this thing is we like to keep it harder
And for real party people just like Afro Pimp and Wadda
What do you want?
Matter fact what do you need?
Cuz we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint
So pass the bottle aint no need to squabble
And hand it to the little homie let him have a swallow
It's a Eastside thang nigga bring yo ass
G's up Ho's down nigga you know the program

No one throws a Eastside party like we do

(So watch ya clock)
The clock tickin'
But it wont stop tickin' cuz everybody kickin' it
We gettin' at the bitches, witches
The main thing gangstas do
Skip the bump cuz the rumps what I came to view
New pussy in the hood shall I kill it? (Kill It!)
The way she got it poppin' oh its probably hotter than a skillet
But baby dont tweek like you aint no freak
Peep I keep my game tight it aint no leaks so we
Can keep this on the down low
And take a walk with the dog and lemme show you what the pound for
Candle lightin romancin'
If I can just get the last dance in
