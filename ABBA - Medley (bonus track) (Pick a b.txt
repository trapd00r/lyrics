Gonna jump down, spin around, pick a bale of cotton 
Gonna jump down, spin around, pick a bale of day 
Gonna jump down, spin around, pick a bale of cotton 
Gonna jump down, spin around, pick a bale a day 
Oh Lawdy, pick a bale of cotton 
Oh Lawdy, pick a bale of day 
Oh Lawdy, pick a bale of cotton 
Oh Lawdy, pick a bale of day 

I say me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton 
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of day 
I say me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of cotton 
Now me and my buddy gonna pick a bale of day 

Oh Lawdy, pick a bale of cotton 
Oh Lawdy, pick a bale a day 
Oh Lawdy, pick a bale of cotton

On top of old Smokey, all covered with snow 
I lost my true lover by courting so slow 
For courting's a pleasure and parting is grief 
And a false hearted lover is worse than a thief 
On top of old Smokey, all covered with snow 
I lost my true lover by courting to slow 

When you wake up in the morning, you hear the ding dong ring 
And you go marching to the table, see the same old thing 
See the fork on the table, nothing in your pan 
If you say a thing about it, you're in trouble with a man 

Let the midnight special shine a light on me 
Let the midnight special shine it's everloving light on me 

If you ever go to Houston, well you'd better act right 
And you'd better not gamble and you'd better not fight 
For the sherrif will arrest you and he'll take you down 
And before you understand it, you are prison bound 

Let the midnight special shine a light on me 
Let the midnight special shine it's everloving light on me 
On me, on me 
Let the midnight special shine a light on me 
Let the midnight special shine it's everloving light on me 
On me, on me 
Let the midnight special shine a light on me 
Let the midnight special shine it's everloving light on me 
On me, on me 
Let the midnight special shine a light on me 
Let the midnight special shine it's everloving light on me 
On me, on me
