Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry 
Nowhere to go, nothing to do with my time
I get lonely
So lonely
Living on my own

Sometimes I feel I'm always walking too fast (so lonely)
And everything is coming down on me, down on me
I go crazy
Oh so crazy
Living on my own

Dee do day day
Dee do day day
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do day day
Dee do day day
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Sometimes I feel nobody gives me no warning
Find my head is always up in the clouds
In a dreamworld
It's not easy 
Living on my own, my own, my own

Dee do day day
Dee do day day
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do day day 
Dee do day day 
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Dee do day day
Dee do day day
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do day day 
Dee do day day 
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Dee do day day
Dee do day day
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do day day 
Dee do day day 
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely yeah
Got to be some good times ahead

Dee do day day
Dee do day day
I don't have no time for no monkey business
Dee do day day 
Dee do day day 
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely yeah
Got to be some good times ahead
