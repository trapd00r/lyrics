-You came into my life 
-I don't have to wonder no more, I can feel it all in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
-It's deep down in my soul 
Feel the Burn 
I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
-Its deep down in my soul
It's Soul Music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
-It's deep down in my soul 

Yo, I first took breath in Hemstead, Long Island 
Born in American ancestry from Ireland 
You ain't knowin me, you'd better stop smilin' 
Aint nothin funny once my dummies start whiling 
You talkin loud now all of a sudden it's silent 
Your premonitions say it's about to get violent 
You want permission just to blink your own eyelids 
I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win 
No stick moves, aint no cap peeling 
Where I come from real men don't catch feelins 
We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin 
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceilin' 
Mass appealin, done it since the '80s 
Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies 
Spend money like crazy, aint got no babies 
If I don't make it in heaven I'll run shit in Hades 

Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul 
-Its deep down in my soul 
It's Soul Music 
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul 
-It's in my soul 
Soul Music 
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul 
-It's deep down in my soul 
Soul Music 
Tryin to find an explanation deep down in my soul 
-It's deep down in my soul 

Yo I shit on competition 
Spit on percussion 
Beats are bonecrushin 
One deep I'm bum-rushin 
Guns they get stuck in 
Someone starts buckin 
The jewels that I'm truckin got pimps upchuckin 
You can't hold me down 
You can't hold my hand 
A full grown man with the one God plan 

I represent the colors that never run 
God bless DMC 
God bless Reverend Run 
R.I.P. for the J.M.J. 
Tell Big and Scott LaRock that we all say hey 
Be like Tupac or be like Kid 'n Play 
Do you wanna burn out or just fade away 
I can rock the mic with no delay 
With my head to the ground every time I pray
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away
Cause this type of shit happens everyday

Feel the burn
-I can feel it all in my soul
It's Soul Music
-It's deep down in my soul
Feel the burn
-It's in my soul
It's Soul Music
-It's deep down in my soul

Feel the burn
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
-Its deep down in my soul
It's Soul Music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
-It's in my soul
Soul Music
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul
-It's deep down in my soul
Soul Music
Tryin to find an explanation deep down in my soul
-It's deep down in my soul
Feel the burn
