I'll still be loving you 

Here we are much more than friends 
The truth is love’s story ends 
But what’s it gonna do 
Though we tried to work it out 
Too many times we had our doubts 
But every word I say is true 

From now til the end of time 
As long as the sun will shine 
You’ll always be a friend of mine 
And I’ll still be loving you 
Although I have to say good bye 
You’ll stay here in this heart of mine 
And that is the reason why I’ll still be loving you 

I don’t know how we fell apart 
So close but yet so far 
And that’s y nobody knows 
But you’ve been so good to me 
A better friend there’ll never be 
So deep inside I hope you know 

From now til the end of time 
As long as the sun will shine 
You’ll always be a friend of mine 
And I’ll still be loving you 
Although I have to say good bye 
You’ll stay here in this heart of mine 
And that is the reason why I’ll still be loving you 

I will still be loving you 
As long as the sun shines 
Better believe that I’ll be loving you 
I will still be loving you 
As long as the sun shines 
Better believe that I’ll be loving you 

From now til the end of time 
As long as the sun will shine 
You’ll always be a friend of mine 
And I’ll still be loving you 
Although I have to say good bye 
You’ll stay here in this heart of mine 
And that is the reason why I’ll still be loving you
