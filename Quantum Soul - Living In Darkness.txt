[Chorus:]
Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel (Ah)
Tell me that I, I was wrong (Yeah)
I was born to let you go (I was Wrong)

[Verse 1:]
Arh this shit ain't been the same sense
I let you go and sense you became this
We had a burn that could spark any flame
Now I'm like Oran jones walking in the rain
We was too peas in a pod but not the same
You was feeling a thug and despised all lames
You more for the love and despised all games
And I was more bout the bitchs and pilling them in the rain
(Every Sound) that I hear is telling me I'm wrong
I couldent say in your face I'll say it in this song
I could say it million times that I played it wrong
Now I gotta spend my days alone, an all

[Chorus:]
Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was born to let you go

Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was born to let you go

[Verse 2:]
Yeah let it burn let it burn-0 look a bee hell in the heart is Inferno
Teaching me a lession but I still never learn
So I keep back tracking moving round in a circul
Now I'm hanging out in the club with no purpus
Wall in between and I can't scratch the servis
I'm starting to feel worthless like was it realy worth it
Fuck up so bad I wonder will we ever work it (out)
But it seems like a long shot my head hurtin shit you killin me
Don't shot, thort that I was sceeming but I stumbled on the wrong plot
I admit I did you wrong, ma an all

[Chorus:]
Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was born to let you go

Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was born to let you go

[Verse 3:]
Ar I live in dark days and bright nights
I know iv fallan, I'm tryin to turn my wrong into rights
Ah but this shit gettin critkal it's crazy
Couse I know that I'm the reason why your misrable
I'm just a man baby doin what a man does
No question I know your searching for the answers
Aahhah life is so unpredictable I would never of
Prodicted I would of got rid of you ah
And I question that a reason
But shit don't just happen shit happen for a reason
I shoulda kept it loyal it was more like a treason
I shoulda called you back wen you was leaving a know?

[Chorus:]
Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was born to let you go

Every sound that I hear
Every soul that I feel
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was born to let you go
