[Verse 1:]
Crip niggas, Blood niggas, Ese's, Asians
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, White Boys, Jamaicans
Latin Kings, Disciples, Vicelords, Hatians
All these muthafuckers been patiently waitin'
Since the west coast fell off the steets been watchin'
The west coast never fell off I was asleep in Compton
Aftermath been here the beats been knockin'
Nate Dogg doin' his thing DPG still poppin'
I got California love fuckin' bitches to that Pac shit
& westside connection been had it locked bitch
I'm in the rear view my gun's is cockin'
I'll put red dots on that nigga head like rodman
All stars, phat laces, gun charge, court cases
Faught that, not guilty I'm back
Niggas hate me been there, done that, sold crack
Got jacked, got shot, came back jumped on Dre's back, payback
Homey I'm bringin' CA back
& I don't do button up shirts or drive Mayback's
All you old record labels tryin' to advance
Aftermath bitch take it like a muthafuckin' man.

[Chorus:]
If you take a look in my eyes
You see I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game tell them where you from
Nigga Westside! [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I'm lowridin' homey, 6 Tre impala
Gold D spinnin' chrome hydraulics
Run up on my low-low you stop breathin'
Hollow tips make niggas disappear like houdini
Gang bangin' is real
Homey I'm livin' proof like Snoop Dogg C-Walkin' on top of the devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse about this & that
Cause red strings in this converse & this a Dre track
Keep jibberin' jabberin' I'll pull a .38 magnum
& get the clickin' & clackin'
You'll homies will wanna know what happened
Come to Compton & see Thriller like Michael Jackson
I might be Spike Lee, All this gun clappin'
Prior to rappin' I was drug traffic
In the dope spot playin' John Madden
Homey I ain't braggin' I took 5
You wanna die? ...Run up on that black 745...

[Chorus:]
If you take a look in my eyes
You see I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game tell them where you from
Nigga Westside! [x2]

[Verse 3:]
New York New York, big city of dreams
I got my L.A. Dodger fitted on I'm doin' my thing
Got me fuckin' wit G-Unit you know the drama that brings
I got niggas in Westside Compton & Southside Queen's
& Buck told me in Cashville I'm good when I come through
So I don't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Po'
I'm gangsta more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play bishop I paint that picture now who got the juice
You niggas is nuts so, I take off your roof
Leave your ass streched out like a Cadillac Coupe
God gotta let me in Heaven all the shit I been through
I was an OG in the hood before I turned 22
Homey I'll let the .38 special rip through that vest
& I now I'm contemplatin' whether or not he left that shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back
I'm startin' to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rappin' these Dre Records.

[Chorus:]
If you take a look in my eyes
You see I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game tell them where you from
Nigga Westside! [x2]
