Tears of the feeble, hands of the slaves
Skin of the mothers, mouths of the babes
Building the towers, belongs to the sky
When the whole thing comes crashing down
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why

Under the shelf, the shelf of the sky
Two eyes, two suns, too heavenly blinds
Swallowing rivers, belongs to the sea
When the whole thing washes away
Don't run to me

I'll be going down, for the rest of the slide
While the rest of you harvest the gold

And the wreck of you, is the death of you all
And the wreck of you, is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the death of you all
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the break and the fall

Under the red, break of the lights
Heroes in stretchers, inch to the site
Blowing to pieces, belong to the wind
When the whole thing blows away
I won't pretend

I'll be going down, for the rest of the slide
While the rest of you harvest the souls

And the wreck of you, is the death of you all
And the wreck of you, is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the death of you all
I'm the death of you, I'm the break and the fall

Behind the blood red break of the lights
Lies the wreck of you for the rest of your life

And the wreck of you, is the death of you all
And the wreck of you, is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the death of you all
I'm the death of you, I'm the break and the fall
