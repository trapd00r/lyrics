My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes
I went and set the thames on fire
I must come back down

She's laughing in her sleeve boys
I can feel it in my bones
But anywhere, anywhere I lay my head
I'm gonna call my home

Well this upside-down
Seems that my pockets filled with gold
And the clouds they've covered over
The wind is blowing cold

And I don't need anybody
'Cause I learned to be alone
Anywhere, anywhere I lay my head
Gonna call my home
Anywhere, anywhere I lay my head
Gonna call my home
