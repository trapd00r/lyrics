Save me
Well come on girl and 
Find me
While I'll just sit and 
Wait here
I'm waiting for the
Moment that somebody opens 
My luck
My luck is slowly fading
I'm losing it 
Unless this 
Is nothing but a 
Dream 
I can't remember it was

Hey girl 
You didn't say your name now
Tomorrow I'll remember
Remember that you're so..

Hey girl 
You didn't say your name now
Tomorrow I'll remember
Remember that you're so..

Hey there 
You didn't say your name girl
Tomorrow I'll remember
Remember that your name was starting with an "s"
And ending 
Well endings are scary
The story of my life is
I'm always very close but then it slips away

Hey girl 
You didn't say your name now
Tomorrow I'll remember
Remember that you're so..

Hey girl 
You didn't say your name now
Tomorrow I'll remember
Remember that you're so..

Hey girl 
You didn't say your name now
Tomorrow I'll remember
Remember that you're so..

Hey girl 
You didn't say your name now
Tomorrow I'll remember
Remember that you're so..
