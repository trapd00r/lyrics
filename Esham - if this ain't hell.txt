Free your mind and you ass will follow... 
The kingdom of heaven is the man 
Free your mind and your ass will follow... 
The kingdom of heaven is the man 
Are you woke, or are you sleepin'? 
The devil's groove is slowin' creepin', 
It's too late, what's my fate? 
Will they let me in heaven's gates? 
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's doors, 
I see whores fuckin' on the floors. 
The fire's burnin', the cross is turnin', 
Upside down, now I'm learnin'. 
I know you knew, well I did too, 
The devil's in the soup, 
I drink the witch's brew. 
Red Rum got to get me some, 
Bloody Mary, now my body's numb. 
I go, you go, 
The serpent and the rainbow. 
Adam and Eve, I believe, 
Pickin' fruit off the wicket trees. 
Will I bite? 
I just might, 
If I do then I'm through. 
Lord forgive me, how I lived, 
How's your wife, and my kids? 
I did the crime, I'll do the time, 
White man trapped inside my mind, 
Adam and Eve, Jesus Christ, Elvis Presley, Vincent Price. 
Nappy hair, black sheep, 
In wolf's clothing, it's all deep. 
Prophecies, comin' true, 
Something you all never knew. 
Will you love me, will you hate me? 
Would you let your daughter date me? 
Where would I take her out on a date? 
We'll go knockin' on heaven's gates. 
The President wants me dead, 
For some of those things I said. 
Heaven's gates, the White House gates, 
Water Gates, paper plates. 
Look inside your dollar bill, 
In God we trust, if you will, 
The pyramid is the great seal. 
And all that stuff they had to steal. 
Black man runnin' through six degrees, 
The Bible in his hands, still on his knees. 
Still got to ask the other man, please, 
Gimme powder milk, and welfare cheese. 
(Chorus 4x) If this ain't hell, I can't tell, 
Sell my soul inside my cell. 
Washington, Redskins, Black skins, let me in. 
Welfare in DC, 
The President says vote for me. 
If I do, it seems odd, 
How one man, becomes God. 
White House, White man, 
God is money so understand. 
His plans, master plan, 
Is to kill off the black man, Jewish man, China man, 
It really don't matter with gun in hand. 
War sucks, big bucks, 
Tell me they don't give a fuck. 
(Chorus 2x) 
What is the difference?(What is the difference?) 
Between(New Orleans!) 1825(And New York!) 1992(Washington!) 1776(Miami!) 1995 In Cut City, 
There are no black people left, 
There are no black people left in Cut City! 
There are no Negros left, no coons left, no Jigs left, no Niggers left!
