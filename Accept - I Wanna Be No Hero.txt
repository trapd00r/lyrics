When I´m down and when I´m feeling sad
You bring me up, you make me glad
Even if I'm really out of control
You stay by me when I stumble and fall

I'm confused tonight - I'm feeling blue
You find a way to help me through
Want you tonight 'cause I feel time is right
Need your sweeps because deep down inside

I can give you nothing but love babe
Try to change, but it's pretty hard
I wanna be no hero, but I know I would die for you
I wanna be no hero, but I'm ready to fight for you
I wanna be no hero, ooh, but I can give you love

Life is a mess - oh yeah

I know that living's not easy with me
But take my love - it´s fair indeed
You drive away all my sorrows and pain
My love is strong, more than a game

I can give you nothing but love babe
Try to change, but it's pretty hard
I wanna be no hero, but I know I would die for you
I wanna be no hero, but I'm ready to fight for you
I wanna be no hero, ooh, but I can give you love

I wanna be no hero - need you tonight
I wanna be no hero - stay by my side
I wanna be no hero - need you tonight
I wanna be no hero - ooh but I can give you love

I can give you nothing but love babe
Try to change, but it's pretty hard
I wanna be no hero, but I know I would die for you
I wanna be no hero, but I'm ready to fight for you
I wanna be no hero, ooh, but I can give you love

I wanna be no hero
I wanna be no hero
I wanna be no hero
I wanna be no hero
