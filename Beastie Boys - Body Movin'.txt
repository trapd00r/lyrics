Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk

I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong?
The ship is docking, inter-lockin
And up-rockin electro-shocking

We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it till the break of dawn

Puttin bodies in motion cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame

Like a bottle of Chateau Neuf Du Pap
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Mike D with the master plan
Ooh my my and thank you ma'am
And when I grab the mic you scream Ooh god damn
The creme de la creme is who I am

MCA where have you been?
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim

Ad Rock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play Defender, I could be your hyper space

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'
