You're gonna say I told you so
I never should have let you go
Ain't it funny that here we are
The two of us in two different bars

In separate cages dancing slow
We ain't got nobody to call our own
You can always go back home
You just might be there alone

I'm drunk and you're insane
I can't quit and you won't change
Ain't no halfhearted Romeo
Why do you treat me so?

Like our love's a joke
Hurts too much to laugh
Can't you at least smile
When you call me that

Days are harder than you would believe
I ain't having luck making ends meet
If time were money then look at me
I'm richer than a poor man should be

Price of admission is much too steep
For broke uneducated clowns like me
It may be true I was first to leave
But now I'm begging you please

My heart's on my sleeve
And I'm tipping my hat
Can't you at least smile
When you call me that

Not much is certain but this is true
My arms are useless if they don't have you
They hang around me with nothing to do
I'm hoping you and yours are lonesome too

Neon's buzzing and here I am
Last one standing, last call again
While you're unfolding in a stranger's hands
I'll drink up and be somebody's man

Angels can walk I've seen it before
They turn handles, they open doors
They act like devils, now you've been warned
They'll vanish when love is war

I'm down on my knees
And you won't have me back
But can't you at least smile
When you call me that
