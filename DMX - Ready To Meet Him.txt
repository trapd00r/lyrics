[Talking]
Let us pray
I thank you Lord for my birth, and everything that's followed
I thank you Lord for today, and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank you Lord for the love of my life, and a friend
I made a promise and I'm loving my wife to the end
I thank you Lord for your guidance, cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now, Lord, this is your house
I thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody, in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing, and I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need you here with me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's something better after here, but everybody, won't go
So I ask you to forgive them, and we'll hope they see
And I thank you for the love that, they've given to me
I will not abuse it, nor will I lead them astray
You see I love them like children, that I see everyday
And I pray, no we pray, together
Get us through the bad weather, and we'll love you forever
Let your thought and my heart, go hand in hand
I first thought, but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as you permit me
Please give me, the strength I need to live, bear with me
Amen

We each walk the path, that we've chosen

[Singing]
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the lord

Lord, you left me stranded
And I don't know why
Told me to live my life
Now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly
I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me you would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still coming at me
Just missing
Sometimes I think all you doing me is just listen
I thought that I was special
That's what you told me
Hold me
Stop acting like you don't know me
What I do so bad that it sent you away from me
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me
(My child I'm here, as I've always been, it was you who went away
And now are back again, what did I say)
Follow your word, and be true
(What did you do)
Well, what I wanted to do
(What have you seen) 
Darkness and hell at a glance 
(What do you want) 
All I want is another chance 

I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

(Just because you went away, my doors are not locked, wanna come back home, 
all you gotta do is knock) 
Ya see, I left home a boy, I returned as a man 
Full grown, and I'm still not able to stand 
(I gave you a hand) 
Well...but I was looking the wrong way 
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray 
And that prayer, took me from here to over there 
Back to over here, 
Now they got me like where? 
Do I belong? 
Do I fit in? 
Things on my mind, where do I begin? 
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart 
I'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start? 
(Thou shall not steal) 
But, what if he stole from me? 
(Thou shall not kill) 
But what if he's tryin' to kill me? 
(Thou shall not, take my, name in vain, no matter how hard it rains, 
withstand the pain) 

I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right

To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord 

Our father, who art in heaven 
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27 
No longer afraid to knock on your door 
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war 
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord 
Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword 
And now that I've seen, what I need to see 
Please take me, where I need to be 
(What have you learned) 
It's better to tell the truth than to lie 
(What have you learned) 
To love my life until I die 
(What have you learned) 
Violence isn't always the key 
(What have you learned) 
You can't always believe what you see 
(What have you learned) 
It's better to forgive and forget 
(What have you learned) 
Give as you expect to get 
(What have you learned) 
That I can't go on without you 
(What have you learned) 
I must've been a fool to ever doubt you 

I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

I'm ready to meet him
