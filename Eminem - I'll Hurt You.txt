[ Intro ] [ Busta ] 

Yeah, Guess who it is 
Ayo Dre I think they in trouble 
Scott Storch why you have to do it like this to 'em 
Feels like a new day, listen 

[ Verse 1 ] [ Busta ] 

Now every time I come in I hit ya niggas with shit regardless 
Uou get retarted,then you niggas aint got a clue. 
On how the fuck I do what I do, and say what I say, 
And spit what I spit, you aint never even gotta question who 
Cause you know that I’m the only nigga that could ever convince 
my villi turn the place into a mutha fuckin' zoo 
Than I come in I spit cr crazy sh sh sh shit and 
ma ma ma makin ni ni ni niggas do exactly what I want'em to 
From my point of view instead of tryin to step up 
you still tryin to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew 
These niggas panic and fret and get schizophrenic 
and let they emotions out and I doubt they could ever test my crew 
Take a second check it I reckon my records are 
better than whatever record you recorded that why your shit is through. 
You fuckin idiot I dont think you get it im one of 
the greatest ever period every syllable is true 

[ Chorus ] [ Busta Rhymes ] 

Now if you aint runnin you aint handicappin your vision 
I think its simple and I think that its really plain to see 
No matter how much you try no matter how much you make an effort 
you niggas could never ever really fuck wit me. 
Cause ill hurt you .. and I will learn you a thing or two 
And ill hurt you.....and ill finish your career for you.....I’ll 

[ Verse 2 ] [ Busta Rhymes ] 

Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas you bunch of 
Bumblin fools who got me rumblin dudes all the way down the block. 
Keep'em stumblin and jumblin over they words and vowels 
Throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock 
And you runnin outta time sick and tired of all your 
Ma ma mumblin ma ma mublin na na nigga I got it locked. 
Every single time you put my shit in the cd playa and 
Turn up the volume you bang your head with courtesy of knock I 
Continue to crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas 
You struggle while I humble a nigga wit the glock 
Than I watch you while I keep a fumblin while I got you 
Ta tremblin for one of my niggas bust your head wit a rock 
Before I start to do another thing that'll make you crown me 
the king wit such a butterswing nigga follow the flock 
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds the summer bling 
while im climbin and from a glimpse tell you bitch to get off my yot 

[ Chorus ] [ Busta Rhymes ] 

[ Verse 3 ] [ Eminem ] 

Shit on the mic and doodle my doo doo 
You do not have a fighting chance to move you are covered in my poo poo 
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid 
Dou dou dou dou dou dou ga ga ga goobers are glued to you 
You don’t have a clue as to what we're about to do do you? 
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have it watch 
So you just made me sneeze I’m allergic to beats like these 
Excuse my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott 
You're probably wonderin why there’s thunder and everyone 
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block 
Cause busa bus and flipmode just tiptoed into the club 
Then with shady quietly try not to start a riot with Doc 
But since we already started we might as well have a party 
So gather out everybody come on lets get our drink on 
And you aint got to do nothin special for this occasion 
Just reach in your closet, throw somethin on and get to the club 

[ Chorus ] [ Busta Rhymes ]
