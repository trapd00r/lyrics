Send "Stand Strong" Ringtone to your Cell Angel on my shoulder, it seems you have fallen.
Drowned in the depths of my heart, you'll never be forgotten.
How come your souls mislead you, and sent you on your way?
You'll have no one to guide you, freewills been set astray.
I will rise above everything you ever stood for.
You're fucking pitiful.

And it's the same for me now when you run away, this is the time for me too.
Right now we set in straight.
This is my last will to live I am falling down, falling down.
No fear of the lesson I learned from you.
Your sincerity burned into fate.
What's it to you it's the same for me.
Further running the fate is set free.
