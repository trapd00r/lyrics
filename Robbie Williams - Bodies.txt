(Gregorian chant-style intro, lyrics missing)

God gave me the sunshine, then showed me my lifeline
I was told it was all mine, then I got laid on the layline
What a day, what a day, and your Jesus really died for me
Then Jesus really tried for me

UK and entropy, I feel like its *fuckin* (beeped out) me
Wanna feed off the energy, love living like a deity
What a day, one day, and your Jesus really died for me
I guess Jesus really tried for me

Bodies in the bodhi tree, Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family, Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery, and that’s the way it’s gonna be

All we’ve ever wanted is to look good naked hope that someone can take it
God save me rejection from my reflection, I want perfection

Praying for the rapture, cause it’s stranger getting stranger
And everything’s contagious it’s the modern middle ages
All day every day and if Jesus really died for me
Then Jesus really tried for me

Bodies in the bodhi tree, Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family, Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery, and that’s the way it’s gonna be

All we’ve ever wanted is to look good naked hope that someone can take it
God save me rejection from my reflection, I want perfection

(Gregorian chant-style chorus, lyrics missing)

Bodies in the bodhi tree, Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family, Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery,
Bodies in the bodhi tree, Bodies making chemistry
Bodies on my family, Bodies in the way of me
Bodies in the cemetery, and that’s the way it’s gonna be

All we’ve ever wanted is to look good naked hope that someone can take it
So God save me rejection from my reflection, I want perfection

Jesus didn’t die for you, what do you want?
(I want perfection)
Jesus didn’t die for you, what are you on?
(I need some ...) [missing]

Ohh
