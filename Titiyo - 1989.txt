Well, I'm afraid of that picture
From 1989
Faded colours and worn out texture
From 1989

Oh my oh my

Well I've been young and I've been stupid
But it's left behind
I regret the things that I did
And I feel fine

We can't go on like this
Don't go on yourself like this
We can't go on like it's 1989

Oh no
Oh my

Let's go back, I'll be your angel
I'll make a deal with time
I don't know if that would change you
Or give you peace of mind

We can't go on like this
Don't go on yourself like this
We can't go on like it's 
1989, 1989, 1989, 1989

We can't go on like this
Don't go on yourself like this
We can't go on like it's 
1989, 1989, 1989, 1989

We can't go on, no
We can't go on like this, oh no
We can't go on
We've gotta move on now
We've gotta move on
(Repeat)

Gotta move on now
Now
