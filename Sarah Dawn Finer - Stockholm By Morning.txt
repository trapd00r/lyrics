Send "Stockholm by Morning" Ringtone to your Cell It's 2 am, at JFK
Been waiting forever
My flight was late

But I'm alright, I'm OK, I guess

-Cause I know I'll see you
In a couple of hours
But my heart gets anxious
When I think about your lips
Your kiss, it's hell baby
Feeling like this

From LA to New York
To London to our front door
Soon I'll be in your arms
Where I belong, babe
Stockholm by morning
It's just a million miles
When I'm away from your smile
But it won't be long
'Til I'll be home in your arms
Stockholm by morning

An ocean between
The two of us
Ain't an easy thing
When I miss your touch
Your taste
Your smell

If I can only get
Through this day
I count down the seconds
Count down the minutes
-Cause nothing really matters
In this world
Baby, when you're not in it

From LA to New York
To London to our front door
Soon I'll be in your arms
Where I belong, babe
Stockholm by morning
It's just a million miles
When I'm away from your smile
But it won´t be long
'Til I'll be home in your arms
Stockholm by morning

Baby, it's a spiritual thing between the both of us
It's two cautious hearts
Turning the corner into trust, baby
You take me, you take me there

From LA to New York
To London to our front door
Soon I'll be in your arms
Where I belong, babe
Stockholm by morning
It's just a million miles
When I'm away from your smile
But it won't be long
'Til I'll be home in your arms
Stockholm by morning

It won´t be long 'til I'll be home
Cause I need you, And I miss you
It won´t be long baby
