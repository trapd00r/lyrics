Mother, give me back my old room. I won't 
make a mess like I used to, I won't play my 
records loud at nights, I'll keep it quiet. Mother, 
let me have my old bed back and lay out clothes 
for me. 

People give me work and money. They depend 
on me now, if they only knew how thin the ice 
they walk on is. If they only knew how thin the 
ice they walk on is. 

Mother, please make my decisions like you once 
did, this time I won't pester you about it, I'll 
surrender. 

Mother, these streets are too cold for me. I'm 
standing by your door. A plant under each arm, 
let me move back in. 

Father, the last time you offered to teach me all 
about the Baltic Sea, it was wasted on me. Now 
I'm ready, throw me once again the footballs you 
tried to throw and this time I will catch and 
learn and know. 

Mother, if that's not enough bring me all the way 
back to my original address to your womb. 

I have trouble sleeping but I don't recall I had 
while in your womb.
