People, are you ready?
Fighters, are you ready
Dreamers, are you ready
If you're truly ready
Come on get ready

They could take me up,
Take me down
I don't care
I'm not found
'Cause we don't understand
The meaning of hamebaham
He said don't let them fool ya
He means the one who rules ya
I say you got to seize the power to be free
And I don't mean the money
And I don't mean control
But I mean the power over our heads and our souls

People are you ready
We got nothing to lose
I won't let them rule my dreams
I won't let them tease me
Don't fall for temptations
or the lives they offer
Where are you, my sisters?
Where are you my brothers?
