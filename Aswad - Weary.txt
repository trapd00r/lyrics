Yes I will you know that I will 
Yes I will cos I'm sure that I will 
Love you love you love you 
So no matter what they do 
And no matter how they contradict 
My philosophy, I know that 
I will keep on loving you 
So no matter what they do 
And no matter how they contradict 
My integrity, I know that 
I will keep on loving you 
See I will keep on loving you 
Until the wind stop blowing in the air 
Oh oh I will keep on loving you 
Until the morning dew stop falling 
Lightly on the ground 
Oh I will keep on loving you 
Until until 
So no matter what they do 
So no matter how they kinda fool me 
Trying to fill my head with lies 
I will keep on loving you 
So no matter how they persecute 
My decision through righteousness 
I will keep on loving you 
Ya see I will keep on loving you 
Until the sun refuses to give 
Its light to all 
Oh I I'll keep'on loving, you 
Until the moon it stops glowing at night 
Oh I I'll keep on loving you 
Until until 

Until all the mountains 
Have crumbled down 
Yes all of them are washed 
into the sea you see 
They could try a little more 
They could really come to cold I up 

But I know that 
I will keep on loving you 
For the fear of his wrath 
Yes the fear of him is always present 
Always ever present in my heart 
I will keep on loving you 
See even when I'm down there 
In their prison cell I know that 
I will keep on loving you 
When the times get rough 
And they say there's not enough 
To go around 
I will keep on loving you 
Yes I will I'll keep on loving you 
When life gets dreary I won't get weary 
You see I and I aswad by the grace of God 
Living in the righteous way
