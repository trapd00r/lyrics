Bang, banging the door
I just have to get out
Sweet talk 'til I'm bored
Stop killing my time
You're way up in the air
Always flashing around
It's all making me sick
But looking good from above

Here comes the first attack
Five fingers to black it out
There's no turning back
I'm proud to say
I'm paying the price

I'm on top of your world
Once and for all and forever to be
The one on top of your world
I know you're out of the game
Start spreading the word right now

Deep deeper and down
Doing all that I can
Working harder than hard
Still you don't understand
Every word that I speak
All the things that I do
Got a problem with that?
Got a problem with you!

Here comes the first attack
Five fingers to black it out
There's no turning back
I'm proud to say
I'm paying the price

I'm on top of your world
Once and for all and forever to be
The one on top of your world
I know you're out of the game
Start spreading the word right now

Saying it's good to be back
Making it hard to forget
Give in
Get out
This time I'm on top of your world
Once and for all and forever to be
The one on top of your world
I know you're out of the game
Start spreading the word right now
