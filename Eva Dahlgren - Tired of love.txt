When you called me on the phone last night
I said that I was tired I hung up
and went back into my dreams
You heard I wasn't sleepy
but it's easier to lie
when the truth is
it doesn't matter what you feel
I didn't know
your love was so deep
you never told me
when I needed you so desperately
but if I say okey come on
I know you run and hide
I know you would
It's so easy to forget when you're with others
'cause you're busy all the time
with showing you're okey
But when I meet you accidentally
you say my love can we talk
I know I never will forget the pain
