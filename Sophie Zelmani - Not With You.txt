Kissed by the rain not by you
Warmed by the spring not by you
Held in a ring dance not by you
Touched by a ghost not by you

Hours on the shore not with you
Filled by the wind not by you
Long for the evening not for you
All those feelings not for you

I'm here, I’m here, I’m flying
I might only miss one thing
I have stopped to talk about it
But it could be dream

Taking a picture not of you
Remembering times not with you
Love has nothing more to do
I'm here not with you
