As I develop the awakened mind
I praise the buddhas as they shine
I bow before you as I travel my path
To join your ranks, I make my full time task

For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
Respect to Shantideva and all the others
Who brought down the dharma for the sisters and brothers

I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing

There's nothing here thats not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too

If others disrespect me and give my flack
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience

I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before

As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing only love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate

Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So that we can work to release them until they've cleared
Therefore, it only make sense
To thank our enemies despite their intent

The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself
I strive for a happiness of mental wealth

With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good of all

I try to make my every action for that highest good
With the altruistic wish to achieve buddahood
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To make my every action for the good of all beings

For the rest of my lifetimes and 
Even beyond I vow to do my best to do no harm
And in times of doubt i can think on the dharma
And the enlightened ones who've graduated Samsara
