Soft kiss and wine
What a pretty friend of mine
We're finally intertwined
Nervous and shy for the moment we will come alive
Tonight
Secret valentine

[Chorus:]
We'll write a song 
That turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's for nothing at all

Lay down, be still
Don't worry talk they will
I'll be loving you until
Morning's first light
Breaks tomorrow 
I'll take care of you tonight

[Chorus:]
We'll write a song 
That turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's for nothing at all
Nothing at all

When guilt fills your head
Brush off rise up from the dead
This is the moment that we will come alive
Brace yourself for love
Sweet love, secret love

[Chorus:]
We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's for nothing at all
(We'll write a song)
That turn's out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's for nothing at all
Nothing at all
