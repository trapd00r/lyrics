Who can say where the road goes,
Where the day flows?
Only time

And who can say if your love grows,
As your heart chose?
Only time

Who can say why your heart sighs,
As your love flies?
Only time

And who can say why your heart cries,
When your love dies?
Only time

Who can say when the roads meet,
That love might be,
In your heart.

And who can say when the day sleeps,
The moon still keeps on moving
If the night keeps all your heart?
Night keeps all your heart

Who can say if your love grows,
As your heart chose?
Only time

And who can say where the road goes,
Where the day flows?
Only time

Who knows?
Only time

Who knows?
Only time
