Patiently Waiting Lyrics

[50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I owe you for this one

[Chorus]
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flowz been hot for so long
If you thinkin Im fuckin fall off your so wrong

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
destination heaven, sit and politic with passengars from nine eleven
The lords blessins leave me lyrically inclined
shit I aint even gotta try to shine
God's a seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
straight out the good book, look, niggaz iz shook
50 fears no man warrior, swing swords like Conan
picture me pen in hand write linez knowin the source'l quote it 
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pap, should that make me bigga?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitta?
In this white man's world Im similiar to a squirrel
lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringin again
These industry niggaz aint friends, they know how to pretend

[Chorus X2]

[Eminem - Hook (heart monitor beeps)]
If ya Patiently waitin to make it through all the hatin
debatin whether or not you could even weather the storm.
when you lay on the table they operatin to save you
itz like an angel came to you sent from the heavenz above

[Eminem - Verse 2 (heart monitor stopz)]
They think they're crazy but they aint crazy lets face it, shit basically
they just playin sick, they aint shit They aint sayin shit.. spray'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
and turn this day into fuckin mayhem you stayin wit me?
Dont let me lose you, Im not tryin to confuse you
when I let loose with this uzi and just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message am I gettin through to you?
You know whatz comin you motherfuckerz dont even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killaz tied up in a knot
The Jugganautz of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this - nothin like survivin the shot
Y'all know what time it iz az soon az Fifty signz on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, cuz I get alot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (50 Cent: woo)- nuclear shower
theres nothin spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty

[Chorus X1]

Its the gun squad ya'll when the shots go off
Itz fifty, they say Itz Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fukin top blown off
Itz fifty, man that wasnt Fifty, they don't holla my name


[50 Cent - Verse 3]
You shoudln't throw stones if you live in a glass house
and if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
cuz I'll break your face, have your ass runnin
mumblin to the Jake, you goin against me dawg you makin a mistake
Ill split you leave you lookin like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all themzippers Im the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
the way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you callin her wifey
I fuck her feed her fast food, you keepin her icy
Im down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94': "We dont love them hoez"
I got pennies for my thoughts, now Im rich
see the twentys spinnin lookin mean on the six
niggaz wearin flagz, cuz the colorz match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holez
muthafuckas

[Chorus X2]

(50 Cent)
Its fifty (X3)
