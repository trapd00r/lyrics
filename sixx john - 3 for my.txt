There they go

Machine shop

Ladies & gentlemen, pleased to meet you
I go by the name of sixx john
Of course you know mike shinoda

Uh oh, let's go, let's go
1 time for my machine shop crew and then it's
2 times sob & lp too and then it's
3 times it's mike and sixx on the track and then
4 times when we come in through the back
They're saying

Oh no
Close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let every body know
Get on the mic and
There they go

Oh no
Close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let every body know get on the mic and
There they go

Dangerous bitch i cant really hang with out this
Everybodys so afraid to buzz shit
Make me wanna hang it up and quit

Dangerous bitch i cant really hang with out

Dangerous bitch i cant really hang with out this
Everybodys so afraid to buzz shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit

Forget about all the things u heard before
Bout time that we're kicking down the door
Everybody's gonna hit the fucking floor
Please mike don't hurt me anymore
I don't gotta have a secret life or alibi
Everybody knows why i'm here
Not just for some crack
Get a bottle
Lets crack u over the head with a bottle of beer
So just listen up there powder-puff
Better believe i'm not playing
You can love it, you can hate
But don't mistake it everybody's saying

Oh no
Close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let every body know get on the mic and
There they go

Oh no
Close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let every body know get on the mic and
There they go

What you really wanna do is this
Just make believe that i don't exist
But you won't cos everytime you go to spit...
[yo check this out..]
I talk over you just like this [shit]
It's annoying just for you
You could scream all day til your face is blue
I'm getting in your head and you know it too
That's just me you don't know my crew [machine shop]
My man sixx john understand though
The way that the way he blows
You can call him rambo
Never missed a shot, never run outta ammo
Come out a heat like a god damn commando
And add in sob
Ryu, tak, vin skully
Cheapshot and now you see
Fuck with me? nah! sixx..

Oh no
Whatever u felt when you see that door closed
I'ma belt for the back
Straight to the bar so i can act
I figured you guys would get a little surprise
Your eyes wide when it's me and mike shinoda
I'm just plain ol sixx john from the nam district
This is not suppose
I still talk with awkward speech
I'm like a dog that's off its leash
Step out with a fort minor patch on a black tee
Niggas gonna walk these streets
I ain't trippin homie
Talk is cheap
Acapellla or we can walk on a beat
And if that ain't enough action
I got 17 pages in a little magazine i keep


We got this place rocking beat knocking non stoppin
If ya'll all with it let me hear it now
We got this place rocking beat knocking non stoppin
If ya'll all with it let me hear it now

1 time for my machine shop crew and then it's
2 times sob & lp too and then it's
3 times it's mike and sixx on the track and then
4 times we do it like that
