Oh Oh Oh Oh Don't Ask Me To Dance
Im Scared This Feeling's Out Of My Hands
That Look Just Took My Breath Away
Its Plugged Me Into You

And Im Tuning In Tuning In
Slowly Like A Radio (Radio, Radio)
You Pull Me In Pull Me In
Baby And I Can't Let Go

Can't Stop Now (We're)

Too Hot Bodies With Chemistry Thats On The Rise
Its Electric Magnetic Electric
The Heat Screams Out And Echoes Around All Tonight
Two Hot Bodies Bound Together With No Choice
Its Electric Magnetic Electric
Star Crossed Lovers Drown In The Sound Of This White
Noise 

Oh Yes Oh Yes Im Hearing It Loud
I Must Confess I Like It
Its Everything I Wanted And More
You Give Me Bait I Bite It

And Im Tuning In Tuning In
Slowly Like A Radio (Radio, Radio)
Its Coming In Coming In
The Signal Is Out Of Control

Can't Stop Now (We're)

Too Hot Bodies With Chemistry Thats On The Rise
Its Electric Magnetic Electric
The Heat Screams Out And Echoes All Around Tonight
Too Hot Bodies Bound Together With No Choice
Its Electric Magnetic Electric
Star Crossed Lovers Drown In The Sound Of This White
Noise

(Its Electric Magnetic Electric)
(This Right Noise)

Oh Oh Oh 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh

Too Hot Bodies With Chemistry Thats On The Rise
Its Electric Magnetic Electric
The Heat Screams Out And Echoes All Around Tonight
Too Hot Bodies Bound Together With No Choice
Its Electric Magnetic Electric
Star Crossed Lovers Drown In The Sound Of This White
