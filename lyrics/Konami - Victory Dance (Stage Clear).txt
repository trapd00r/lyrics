At the center of my heart there sits a throne 
That the rightful occupant's not always 
free to call His own 
For how can I give the King 
His place of worth above all else 
When I spend my time striving 
to place that corwn upon myself 

Battle cry, to engage 
For the war, set the stage 
And the armies march and kings arise 
For the choice, time has come 
Mine or Thy will be done? 
And the pain reflects in holy eyes 
For the will to obey 
From the night to the day 
And the seasons change and rulers die 
Not of flesh, not of men 
Wage the war deep within 
On and on it rages undenied 

I take my crown, cast it down 
Castles burning, Castles burning 
Learn to grow, grow to be 
A flesh and blood Theocracy 
To take the loss, bear the cross 
Raise the Kingdom, raise the Kingdom 
Burn away all I've been 
To resurrect Theocracy within 

And the would-be rulers of my heart 
That I place upon the throne 
Each lead the kingdom of my life to ruin 
To bring every thought into submission, 
to tear the idols down 
is to break the chains, to rearrange 
to give the King his crown 

Battle cry, to engage 
For the war, set the stage 
And the armies march and kings arise 
For the choice, time has come 
Mine or Thy will be done? 
And the pain reflects in holy eyes 
For the will to obey 
From the night to the day 
And the seasons change and rulers die 
Not of flesh, not of men 
Wage the war deep within 
On and on it rages undenied 

I take my crown, cast it down 
Castles burning, Castles burning 
Learn to grow, grow to be 
A flesh and blood Theocracy 
To take the loss, bear the cross 
Raise the Kingdom, raise the Kingdom 
Burn away all I've been 
To resurrect Theocracy within 

Father, use me to be Your hands down here 
A mirror to reflect Your glory into hurting eyes 
And let me see the world with vision clear 
and not through selfishness and lies 
For if I am consumed with my own cares 
What right will I have to speak the words 
"The Kingdom come"? 
And if I am consumed with my own will 
What right to pray "Thy will be done"? 

As all around me I see bleeding souls 
Please give me strength to never pass them idly by 
And as the angry stormclouds start to roll, 
May they see comfort in my eyes 
For just as you are full of mercy and love 
The same to others, You have called me to be 
And by the covenant of grace, above and below 
Within our souls: Theocracy 

Battle cry, to engage 
For the war, set the stage 
And the armies march and kings arise 
For the choice, time has come 
Mine or Thy will be done? 
And the pain reflects in holy eyes 
For the will to obey 
From the night to the day 
And the seasons change and rulers die 
Not of flesh, not of men 
Wage the war deep within 
On and on it rages undenied 

I take my crown, cast it down 
Castles burning, Castles burning 
Learn to grow, grow to be 
A flesh and blood Theocracy 
To take the loss, bear the cross 
Raise the Kingdom, raise the Kingdom 
Burn away all I've been 
To resurrect Theocracy within
