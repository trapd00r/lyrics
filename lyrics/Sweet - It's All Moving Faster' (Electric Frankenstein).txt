It's hard to make a livin'
When it's just too hard to breathe
We're takin', never givin'
Forgettin' things you believe
It's all around the city
At such a rapid pace
It all becomes a pity
When somone shoves it in your face

New York City's such a bore
It's all moving faster
Can't buy feelings from some store
It's one big disaster

We're takin' it all for granted
Then they put you to a test
Didn't they know what they created
Would become this much a mess
So finish what you started
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
You made us all evil hearted
Now you'll never be the same

New York City's such a bore
It's all moving faster
Can't buy feelings from some store
It's one big disaster
New York City's such a whore
It's all moving faster
Can't buy feelings from some store
It's one big disaster

It's all movin' faster
And I can't keep up this pace
It's one big disaster
And I'm fallin far from grace
It's all movin' faster
You try hard to put me down
It's one big disaster
But I'll never hit the ground

New York City's such a bore
It's all moving faster
Can't buy feelings from some store
It's one big disaster
New York City's such a whore
It's all moving faster
Can't buy feelings from some store
It's one big disaster
