I know a place
Where the sun's always shining,
With lovely flowers around everywhere.
Come take my hand,
I'll show you I'll guide you.
I know this place
It's deep down inside you.

I know a place
Where people not fighting,
With smiling faces around everywhere.
Come take my hand,
I'll show you I'll guide you.
I know this place
It's deep down inside you.

Come take my hand
I'll lead you just follow me.
To wonderland,
It's deep down inside of you.
Come take my hand
I'll lead you just follow me.
Come take my hand,
Come take my hand.

Come take my hand
I'll lead you just follow me.
To wonderland,
It's deep down inside of you.
Come take my hand
I'll lead you just follow me.
Come take my hand,
Come take my hand.

Fantasize, energize,
Only you can rise, rise.
If you really wanna do it,
Get in to it, baby move it.
Slip slide to the place,
Bring a happy face, bass.
Treble rebel is what I am,
I boogie in the wonderland.

It's up to you to find,
What you're looking for,
As I rock, rock, rock to the rhythm,
I can give you more, more,
From the soul, take control,
Find yourself never to old.
Come, Come take my hand,
And I will take you to this land.

Take a chance, to enchant,
On the floor as you dance.
Come, come take my hand,
Travel with me to a land,
Of happiness for everyone,
Run, run here I come.

Pick it up, pick it up, don't be late,
Feel the groove don't be late,
To go inside take a ride,
Now you now you can't deny.
What you feel is it real,
Let it go and you will know,
What to do it's up to you,
Follow me it's nothing new.
Come, come take my hand and
I will take you to this land.
