You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
But me myself, I got nothing to prove
 
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
 
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights way out before us 
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
 
You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights way out before us 
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car, and we go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job and 
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll be promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs
 
So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights way out before us 
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and I would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
 
You got a fast car
It is fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight or live and die this way
