The Calm Before
Matt Elliott

Here comes a storm
The dust & papers dance around the room
It tells of a storm
The sky is a painted viscous swirl of troubled hues
There′s a storm
The branches rock & dance & creak & wave
We're in for a storm
I′ve got this headache that I've had for days
Here comes the rain
The first few drops caress & gently dance
They light up your face
You smile in wonder looking through the eyes of a child once again
But soon the gentle drops become the deadly wolf of a gale
Our voices become lost beneath the chaos
Here comes a storm
The way the wind it starts to play and race
It whispers a storm
& Here comes a storm
Just as everything was falling into place here's a storm
There must be a storm
Don′t we need it
Just to clear it
To blow the dust away
Away, to a place where it can never be found or thought of again

Draw me the shades
The beasts that softly whisper in your ear & keep you awake
We all have ghosts & monsters dear it′s best to give them a face
& Then you simply take it, burn & throw the ashes away
The creeping doubts will disappear without trace
Here comes the dawn
I can't believe we′ve been sitting here all night talking this long
About exactly when & where it started going so wrong
Dissecting every aspect as if it was fine all along
I told you that I'd never been all that strong
Here comes a storm
& With it come the things that we will have to face in this storm
& Here comes a storm
Just as everything was falling into place here′s a storm
There must be a storm
Don't we need it
Just to clear it
To blow the ashes away
Away, to a place where they can never be found or thought of again

This patch of blue, this ray of sun
The sense of a strange uneasy calm
Perhaps that was all, perhaps we′re done
Or maybe the worst is yet to come
& All is calm & cold as death
As all of nature holds her breath
But soon enough she'll blow
She'll howl
She knows
& She will howl
She′ll blow us deep into the ground
To the ground
Where we can only pray that we′ll never be found
