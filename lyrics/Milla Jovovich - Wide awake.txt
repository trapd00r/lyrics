Wading into the dotted light
Wet my brain before it dries
Move so fast you block out the sky
Read my lips before they die

-And I'm wide awake-

Storm keeps breaking
Into the living room
Tears the roof off
Smashing windows
Fling myself out of the ceiling
Don't let gravity anywhere near me

-And I'm wide awake-
