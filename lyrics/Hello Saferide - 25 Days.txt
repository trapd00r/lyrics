25, 25 days. That's too much, that's too much! 
25, 25 days. That's too much, that's too much! 
25, until I get to see you. 25, until I get to know 
if what we just started will have conquered 
backpacker girls with newly braided hair and 
Mano Chao records. It will soon be 24. Oh! 
You're so worth waiting for. 

24, 24 days. Still too much, much too much. 
24, 24 days. Half an hour done just writing this 
song. 24, oh I see mouths moving. 24, and I nod 
at what might be the right time to nod. You and 
I hadn't even met 24 days ago. I must have been 
so low! And I didn't even know! 

23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 10 
(because I slept for so long those days) 9, 8, 7, 6, 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 

I get a text from you, saying you're off to 
Havanna airport as we speak. I start brushing 
my teeth. Ten minutes later: “Sorry I mixd up d 
days :)”. YOU STUPID FUCK. YOU STUPID 
FUCK. You stupid fuck, you need to come 
back. Oh. 

I'm at Arlanda airport with a famous flower in 
my hand waiting for you. I see the doors open- 
ing, I see the passengers pouring out fresh like 
gingerbread cookies and wearing what appears 
to be new, funky hats, I see from a distance it's 
someone I know well you're approaching, I can 
see it, I take a step forward.
