...And The Halls Of The Whisperer Nocturnal Voices
Lyrics: Bellhharar Belphegor / Music: Bergelmir Malphënger
Arrangements: Fenrir Viernövich and Bergelmir Malphënger

In turn of the chaos kingdom and terror
A fighter's soul
He travels my road of obscurity
Declaring the great celebration of the blood

I have nightmares at night
With the souls that I sacrificed
So that my sanctified armor
If it perpetuated with the spilled blood

The call becomes pleased
When the cruel spirits
That stop until my feet
And they ask your master for mercy

In the halls of your hell
Nocturnal voices whispering my name

Depraved angels... temples in tears
They give me force to send my hate scream
To all that against my blasphemy
It is opposed until the death
