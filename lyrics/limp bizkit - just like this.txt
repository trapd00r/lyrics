Just like this

Do you feel it
Then get up

Just like this

Do you wanna catch the vibe
That's keepin' me alive
Following these fat ass beats
Till I die

Fill 'em with tension
The sick dimension
Rumble the earth with
My lowered suspension

Watch the ground move
Let the sound prove
That it ain't fake when
The girls get naked

Don't call it a comeback
We bring that beat back
And we made sure that
John kept them beats phat

A lyrical rampage
Burnin' your headset
Open your minds
My rhymes ain't dead yet

I want you to stand up
Put them hands up
I'll break it on down
'Cause you're pumpin' my band up

Like this
Just like this

Come on
Get up
Get up

Get up
Get up

Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world
Is throwin' at me

The rhythm's so insane
It's flowin' through your vein
Triggerin the neck poppin'
Nerve up in your brain

I don't even know ya
But came to show ya
The Bizkit's Limp
When the night is over

We shake the whole place
Make this earth quake
And it ain't fake
When we start the riots

So rock the bells
Psycho females doin' time
Blowin' up the phone lines

Call it a stampede
Comin' to your town
We ain't gonna hold back
We're comin' to get down

I want you to stand up
Put them hands up
And break it on down
'Cause you're pumpin' my band up

Like this
Just like this

Come on
Get up
Get up

Get up
Get up

Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world
Is throwin' at me

And I'll do what it takes
If I make some mistakes
It's okay 'cause it's all
Just the way it should be

A-break it

Limp Bizkit's in the house, y'all
Limp Bizkit's in the house, y'al
Limp Bizkit's in the house, y'all
Hey-yo John
Bring that beat back

Uh

Just like this
Do you feel it
Just like this
Yo, bring that beat back
Like this

Music is key
It's the way we're set free
From all this world
Is throwin' at me

And I'll do what it takes
If I make some mistakes
It's okay 'cause it's all
Just the way it should be
