Take a part of me
The plan slips out of me
I won't be won't be the one
Who can never look back and care about you
It's like I'll always be the one you only hear about

Talk, let it tumble out
I let myself fall down when you're around
I'll race you to the top, you're up ahead
Every little thing that they said has gone away
I'll always grow dark when you're playing games
Come on inside can you stay and play it all away

'Cause I can only talk with you
I just want a peep from you
Everything swims around
Got both feet on the ground
Hoping everything will stop but it's swirling around
And all I wanna do is change
But I'm so stuck in my ways
And every time I talk I forget
There's this whole world outside of my head
Sometimes I knock but there's nobody there

'Cause I can only talk with you
I just want a peep from you
Everything swims around
Got both feet on the ground
Hoping everything will stop but it's swirling around
And all I wanna do is change
But I'm so stuck in my ways
And every time I talk I forget
There's this whole world outside of my head
Sometimes I knock but there's nobody there

The plan slips out of me
