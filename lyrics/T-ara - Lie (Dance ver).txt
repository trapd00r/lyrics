Same place I've always been
Crossing the roads again
No more tears
My hands
Calm and tired and alone
We're not alone

Same old dreams
Lost at sea
Caught in a net which
Startles me, guide me but they
Keep burning out, keep burning out
Turning into things they never thought
They'd be


March around
Jericho loved the music
And fell
Into your arms
(breathless)


Heard a sound
Did you hear the dance of
The whispher of a storm coming


Oh, oh, funny how
We spent this time waiting around
Oh, oh, it's a lie
Everything you had till now


Saw her dancing
The slow gate-way
Open this
To say her name
Saw her falling
Cast away
Cast away
She learned to fly away


Oh, oh, funny how
We spent this time lashing out
Oh, oh, it's a lie
Everything you had till now


Same place
Always been
I'm lost on these roads again
Just as I got near the end
I keep falling in the holes you left in me


Oh, oh, funny how
I've spent this time on the ground
Oh, oh, it's a lie
Its a lie
Everything you've said till now
