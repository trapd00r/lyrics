I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feeling gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter 'cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win 'cause he's my bestfriend
But now I'm guilty, I'm fallin' for his girlfriend

I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
It's like a trap that I'm sinking into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin' 'cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel possesed by you
I have these thoughts at night of undressing you

It's kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't so he keeps on trusting me
Leaves me alone with you while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me with this temptation
Now I'm confused 'cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin' you sayin' to comeover
Now what do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
It's gettin' rougher 'cause I suffer from a burnin' heart

My burnin' heart

Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel and now you wanna leave me lonely
What did I do? Baby, did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken and now you make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love and now we are departed
Girl, I buy you anything your heart desires
I have to let you know, baby, you're my fire

Warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
This sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just being with you and seeing the two of us
Walking along the beach 'cause, girl, you are my peach
So sweet and tender my love I surrender
No need to pretend that you want it to end
I'll never let you go you're forever my girl
You know why? 'Cause girl, you are my world

My burnin' heart

Totally tongue tied every two seconds I keep watching you
He's my best friend but I can't help clockin' you
How could this be, how could we both love you?
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reenforce upon the sores that's already there
So many times my mind was locked up and we passionately stare

Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction 'cause I fiend for you desperatley
I stand here fantasicing because you're next to me
What can I do with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind and so I'm feelin' nervous

I wanna tell you how I feel but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though it drives me crazy to see you sitting with him
A tear rolls down my cheak because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're saying before they can be said
Hear the thoughts you be thinkin' before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brotha for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl

My burnin' heart, heart, heart

My heart is burnin' you know it's yearin' for your sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
You know you love me why must you deny yourself
What I can offer you yet you want somebody else
It's not that well then girl what could it be
I hope I'm good for you 'cause baby, you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then acted fool and cool and cruel like a church

Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby, you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you 'cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire

My burnin' heart

I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya the feeling gets stronger
You sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter 'cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win 'cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty I'm fallin' for his girlfriend

I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
It's like a trap that I'm sinking into

Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feeling comes right back

But you keep callin', you sayin' to comeover
Now what do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
It's gettin' rougher 'cause I suffer from a burnin' heart

My burnin' heart
My burnin' heart
My burnin' heart
My burnin' heart
