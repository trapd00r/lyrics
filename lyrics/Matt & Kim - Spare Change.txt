And it all
Comes down to hope
Came down on me
I'm beggin you now
I'm beggin you please
Comes down to hope
Came down on me

Someday spare change
Won't feel the same
Stand up real tall
And wait to be called
Thoughts so strong
I feel them when you're gone

And these
Old walks in the park
And meetings after dark
A sore sight
For sore eyes
Wild and free, you've got no place to be
Oh, comes down to hope, came down on me
