Fergie:
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up
Shut up
Just shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

We're tryin' to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we're tryin' to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy
For tryin' to be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

Will.i.am:
Girl, me and you were just fine you know
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love you know
Walks on the beach and stuff you know
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yellin' when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bullshit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bullshit)
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quit this lecture

Fergie:
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

We're tryin' to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we're tryin' to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy
For tryin' to be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

Taboo:
Why does he know she gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough?
Cause fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin'
For a lovin' transition
Girl it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Few mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin'
"Who the hell!"
Who the hell?
What the hell's going down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and

Fergie:
Shut up, just shut up, shut up.
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up.

We're tryin' to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we're tryin' to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy
For tryin' to be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up

Will.i.am and Fergie:
Girl our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?
I never been a quitter
But I do deserve better
Believe me I will do bad
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Who-o-o-a-a!

Fergie:
We're tryin' to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we're trying to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy
For tryin' to be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

Will.i.am:
Stop the talking baby
Or I start walking baby (repeat)
Is that all there is?... (repeat till fade)
