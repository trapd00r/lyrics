Says huckle up, baby
Says huckle up, baby
Just huckle up, baby
Huckle up all day long

Gotta let me go
Gotta let me live

Huckle up, huckle up all day long

Huckle buckin' now
Huckle buck now, baby
Huckle buck now, baby
Huckle buck, now huckle buck all night long

Huckle up baby
Said huckle up, baby
Said huckle up, baby
Said huckle up, baby
Huckle buck all night long

Ooh, said huckle up, baby
Said huckle up, baby
Oh, huckle up baby
Huckle up all night long
