Well disaster, it strikes on a daily basis 
I'm looking for wisdom in all the wrong places 
But still want to laugh in disappointed faces 
But you can't help me 
Blinded by these 

Heroes and Thieves at my door 
I can't seem to tell them apart anymore. 
Just when I've figured it out: 
Darlin' it's you I'm without. 

Well I'm stubborn and wrong ,
But at least I know it. 
I keep moving along and hope I can get through this, 
But maybe this song is the best I can do it 
So I'm patiently waiting on these 

Heroes and Thieves at my door, 
I can't seem to tell them apart anymore. 
Just when I've figured it out: 
Well darlin' it's you 
Darlin' it's you oh, 
Darlin' it's you I'mâ€¦ 

Without your comforting logic 
Like these days are the ones I'll miss 
And I seek a solitude that I can't find without you
Ah ah, ah 
La da da 

Well it seems like I'm getting closer somehow 
A flicker of peace that I've finally found 
Thank you for believing in me now 
'Cause I do need it 

Give me a year or two, 
And I'll mend my ways and see these mistakes, and
When I see the truth 
Well darlin' trust me 
When I can't see 
I'll be coming back; I'll be coming back 'cause there are

Heroes and thieves at my door 
I can't seem to tell them apart anymore 
Just when I've figured it out 
Darlin' it's you 
Darlin' it's you 
Well, darling it's you I'm without 
Ah, ah, ah.
