When I cry, you cry, we cry, together
Said I cry, you cry, we cry, together
Said I cry, you cry, we cry, together
Said I cry, you cry, we cry, together

I love my life, I love my wife
A bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me
I'm livin' in hell, but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me, because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Martine
Let's get the party cracking right here, fuck VIP
Now when my baby loves me, home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by telling her lies
She ain't surprised at me, she's just surprised that we
Been together for this long, and I can be
The one to mistreat her, thought it last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry, we cry together

From what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin' school, gettin' high with the hottest bitches
Livin' life so free that we ain't fearing
The ills of the world, and the heat of drug dealing
You and I then made a killing, and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever a tie this close
Not the love between us, but your love for the dough
You went OT, started makin' m-o-n-e-y
All my good niggas gotta die, wish it could last forever
I wish death was pleasure
'Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

Wash away your tears, my love
You ain't got to cry no more, my love
I'm putting on everything out, my love
And my pain, it's my love
And I want this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear, 'cause the nigga died happily
My mama warned me life was a mothafucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night, she'd just look at me
Tears in her eyes, and they be saying shit like
'I don't want my baby to die'
Brought so much pain into her life, I gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried, I cried, we cried together
