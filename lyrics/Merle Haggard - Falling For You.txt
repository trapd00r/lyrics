You bring me happiness and leave me loneliness
My world is in distress 'cause I'm falling for you
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies
You're a heartbreak in disguise and I'm falling for you

Oh darling, when you're near my world is happy dear
But when you disappear I'm afraid that we're through
I love in misery you're so unfair to me
It's all a mystery why I'm falling for you

Oh darling, when you're near my world is happy dear
But when you disappear I'm afraid that we're through
I love in misery you're so unfair to me
It's all a mystery why I'm falling for you
