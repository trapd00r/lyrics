I'm watching somebody's heart break in two.
And wondering if somewhere your crying to.
Shadows in a mirror tell me that I'm wrong.
Shadows in a mirror, tell me that we're through.

I'm watching somebody's world at an end.
And wondering if someday we'll love again.
Shadows in a mirror tell me that I'm wrong.
Shadows in a mirror, tell me that we're through.

Oh and I, I still need your love.
I can't see my life darling without you.

Shadows in a mirror, shadows in a mirror.

I'm watching somebody's world at an end.
And wishing that somehow we could love again.
Shadows in a mirror tell me that I'm wrong.
Shadows in a mirror, tell me that we're through.

Oh and I, I still need your love.
I can't see my life darling without you.
Shadows in a mirror, shadows in a mirror.
Shadows in a mirror.
