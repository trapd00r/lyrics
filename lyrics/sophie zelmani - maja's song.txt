Couldn't lend him
To you forever
Said the hard man
From above

Made you to
A giver and a savor
But also to a loser of love

Made your heart
Big enough to carry
Every kind of pain

Made you to a dream
For marriage
But also to someone
I must drain

Gave your eyes
The colour of an ocean
Where anybody could drown

I'd swear an oath
On your sterling friendship
But I will always
Let you down

In storms and rain
It's hard to light the candle
And I'm sorry when
It's snowing on his stone
The gravel-walk's so familiar
With your footsteps
That's a sound that could
Make me leave the throne

Couldn't lend
Him to you forever
Said the hard man
From above
