In his wall of madness 
Deep inside his brain 
The Deathripper's calling out 
To end his pain 

The punishment, the after math 
The final blow, the last laugh 
Hes holding too little 
Of the sanity he grasps 

A grisly plot he made 
Now locked up in a cage 
A lion pacing back and forth 
Holding back his rage 

His clenched fist only shows 
His hatred as it grows 
How much more can a man hold back 
Until his head explodes 

Sentenced to death 
With no hope in sight 
Murdering victims 
Robs them of life 

His sentence set in stone 
Hes gonna make 'em pay 
His only chance for freedom 
Will be your judgment day!

In his wall of madness 
Deep inside his brain 
The Deathripper's calling out 
To end his pain 

The punishment, the after math 
The final blow, the last laugh 
Hes holding too little 
Of the sanity he grasps 

A grisly plot he made 
Now locked up in a cage 
A lion pacing back and forth 
Holding back his rage 

His clenched fist only shows 
His hatred as it grows 
How much more can a man hold back 
Until his head explodes
