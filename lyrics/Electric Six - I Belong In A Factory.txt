Life in 360 degrees
I'm just one of the busy bees
Buzzing in time to the one two threes
Doing heavy lifting that destroyed my knees

Kids today they never say please
But today's angry youth ain't angry enough for me
I'm being all I can be
On a working man's salary

I belong in a factory
Maybe one day I'll take a day off or three
And I'll build you a house in a tree
So you can look down at the factory
Consume me

In due time you will come to see
There is nothing wrong with you that's not wrong with me
With everybody here stepping on my feet
It's a wonder that both ends always meet

But we separate the chaff from the wheat
Today's middle class is just so bourgeoisie
And I'm picking up my disease
On a working man's salary

I belong in a factory
Maybe one day I'll get my foreman to see
That productivity is going way up in the factory
Because of me

Once I was led to believe
That you'd return and come back to me
Working the earth and planting our seeds
Growing alfalfa, carrots and peas

Now my heart it just bleeds
And bleeds and bleeds ever since you felt the need
To open your mouth and sneeze
All over my working man's salary

I belong in a factory
Maybe one day when it's under lock and key
We can start a colony
For people who used to be people in a factory
Like me

Let's hear it for the factory
The only thing that's understood me truly
Made a factory man out of me
Three cheers for the factory
Go factory!
