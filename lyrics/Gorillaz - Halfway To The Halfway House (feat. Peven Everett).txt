I, I wait
What ya gotta say now?
When I pick you out baby
What ya gotta say now?
You're coming on to me, just
We're going to religion
Like water, we're moving baby
And we're running through life's cycles
This is the ego shaking
We need to escalate it
We're only halfway to the lover waiting

Halfway, halfway to the halfway house
We're not takers

We're feeling the same chill
It's giving momentum
We're feeling the same thrill
Whatever we do, trust
Imagine a broadcast, the central in mountain
You say that you want your cherryade fountain

Cherry (Cherry)
Cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found mercy (I found mercy)

Play piano, I'll sing mercy
Cherry-ch-ch-ch-cherry, baby
Cherry, cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found mercy (I found mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)
Swim in the light!
(Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)
Gotta get out!
(Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)

Cherry (Cherry)
Cherryade fountain
(Cherryade fountain)
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found, I found, I found mercy baby
I found
Cherry, cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found
I found mercy (I found mercy)

Do that, G
I found mercy
