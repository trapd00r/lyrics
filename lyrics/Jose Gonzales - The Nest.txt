Saw them gathering sticks from the ground
By the thicket while assembling a nest.

On alert for any lingering threats.
Building frantically without rest.

Walls grew dense and blocked out the sun.
Caving in everyone.

Darkness fell wiped out a once joyous tone.
Then famished, like possessed ended up eating their own.

Saw them gathering sticks from the ground
By the thicket while assembling the nest.
