Hey yeah we had everything 
Vinyl in mono 
And we looked the other way 
Man we were so dumb 
Is this the part in the book that you wrote 
Where I gotta come and save the day 
Did you miss me 
Did you miss me 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 

Well they say that rock is dead 
And they're probably right 
99 girls in the pit 
Did it have to come to this?

Oh God you owe me one more song 
So I can prove to you that 
I'm so much better than him 
Oh god please listen fast 
Here comes the crash 
We're gonna rise above 
We gotta smash it up 
You won't abandon us again 

Give us brilliant boys we wanna fuck, man
Full of ecstasy, hard drugs and bad luck 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Turn the lights back on 
You burn so hard 
But you won't burn long 

Three chords in your pocket tonight 
Are you, you the one 
With the spark to bring my punk rock back
(I don't think so) 

Oh God I wanna hear you say 
I wanna hear you say, that you're sorry again 
Oh God you owe me one more song 
So I can prove to you 
That I'm so much better than him 
Oh God I'd give you anything 
To hear you say that I was right 
And you were wrong 

Oh God before I leave this life 
Enable us to love,
A hooker's never gonna come 
Just give it back to me 
Blow out all of the lights tonight 

Oh yeah 
Drive a million miles down the PCH 
(And now he's gone) 
I slashed his tires, I bled his brakes 
(It had to be done)
Their hand-job lives were just too cruel 
(But) mercy was done 
We drowned them all in their swimming pools 
Run away, run away, run away yeah 

Oh God I wanna hear you say 
I wanna hear you say that you were wrong again 
Oh God I wanna hear you say 
I wanna hear you say that 
That I'm so much better than him 
Oh God you owe us one more song 
Get out of my life 
See this world as it really is 

Is it just a sad slide show 
Can you make a hooker cum? 
And enable us to love 
I need one thing that's divine 
Let me hear it tonight 
Let me hear it tonight 
I've gotta hear it tonight 
You're gonna let me hear the lost chord tonight 
yeah
