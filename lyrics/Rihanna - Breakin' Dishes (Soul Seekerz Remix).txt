I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

He been gone since three thirty
And coming home, lately at three thirty
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby you goin' get it

Now I ain't tripping (Ah!)
I ain't twisted (Ah!)
I ain't demented (Huh!)
Well, just a lil bit (Huh!)
I'm kickin' ass
I'm taking names
I'm on flame
Don't come home late

I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All Night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police and lights
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tongiht
I'm a fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an

I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire

I am getting restless
I am getting testy
And I can't believe he's always out
Every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I am looking round for something else to throw

I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All Night (Uh-huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police and lights (Uh-huh)
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
Ohhhhh

I don't know who you think I am (I am.....)
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come I'ma huff and puff
and blow this, blow this whole
Blow this, blow this,
I'm a blow this, blow this whole
blow this, blow this,
I'ma blow this, blow this whole
Blow this house house down!
Dishes, breaking dishes, breaking dishes

I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All Night (Uh-huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
