Jerome, Jerome, put on that Bobby Womack

Nah girl I wanna go way back, ah yeah check this out

Yeah, I might be wrong but sometimes I feel like you can't get to the future, until you address your past. Ya dig? Just listen

Hook:
If I could go, if I could go
Back in the day to say the things I didn't know before...Mmmm
I could be so much better
Life would be so much better, Yeah
That would be nice right now
Thinking of opportunities that I missed out on, yeah
Take me back (me back)
Take me back (me back)
Take me back (me back)

Jones:
Man it gets hard not to reminisce
When I sit and think about the lips on you I haven't kissed-
From the, days of you dating the dude that had my initials
To that, one night that I saw you strut and we took that good picture-
It's just a, different scenario 'cause life has kept moving
And now I watch your Snapchat just so I know how you're doing-
I'm mean I'm, I'm proud of you, you've accomplished alot
But when your husband comes on, yeah that's right when I stop
Not all the time, cause honeslty I've been trying
To get you off of my mind
So I can keep moving forward
Finally I realized I'll probably end up dying
With you, still on my heart when i get to go meet the Lord-
At least you'll get to see heaven, twice
'Cause you're an angel in your own way
But yet and still you're so much badder than my worst day
The "what-if" is what really kills me in the first place-
You're the only reason I have mixed feelings about my birthday, damn
Happy Anniversary by the way..

Hook:
If I could go, if I could go
Back in the day to say the things I didn't know before...Mmmm
I could be so much better
Life would be so much better, Yeah
That would be nice right now
Thinking of opportunities that I missed out on, yeah
Take me back (me back)
Take me back (me back)
Take me back (me back)

VII's Verse:
June 6 2006.....My family was homeless
That’s 666......The devil was on it my greatest opponent
Mama was a beautician.....and she heavily gifted
Medusa/Poetic Justice braids.....these snakes be having me twisted
Father figure what I was missing
Figure the fathers
Only go farther
To figure what’s missing just from a distance

Well, at least he consistent

Got 4 brothers, never had a victor so sweet
Vegetarian personalities.....they don’t wanna meet
My la familia
Made up a heaven
Even through hell, oh well
Bottomless pits or
Milk and honey
You Couldn’t even tell, oh well
Hung with Vice Lords, 'Disciples and them Crips (and them Crips)
Forgive my vice lord
What I Decide to pull
Is Gone leave me crip

From my future because of my past
Project housing moving so fast
Euphoria never ever came first
But best believe we making it last
Even though we been through hell and back
And even thick and thin (Even thick and thin)

I still wish i was that kid again

Hook:
If I could go, if I could go
Back in the day to say the things I didn't know before...Mmmm

That would be nice right now
Thinking of opportunities that I missed out on, yeah
Take me back (me back)
Take me back (me back)

Dolla Black Verse:
On granny front porch with kinfolk whip ride by hollin bingo
Young kings living day by day our own vibes and lingo
Staying up long nights on the 64-
Turned to early mornings in the driveway
Then early mornings in Sunday School
Trying hard just to stay awake
No heartbreak really had it simple-
Moms really gave us the best she could unh
Trip about anything
Boy I wish you would
Only time I seen people killed-
Was on sidelines or a hard drive
Posterized on a hard drive
Whole hood out here going live
And them summer vibes was the greatest trips-
I had just to see my Pops (see my Pops)
My Chi’ family loved to have me back
All love up on the block unh (Love up on the block)
My old hood off Old Canton
Where Leeland dubbed me Dolla unh (Leeland dubbed me Dolla)
Freestyling on the the bus battling bars-
Just tryna make a dollar unh (Tryna make a dollar)
Now I’m out here making dollars unh (Out here making dollars)
Plenty dollars just to pay the bills
Past due and pay me later bills
Now I know just how my people feel
Never noticed how the time flies-
Til you’re looking back over everything
Talking bout all the things I would’ve changed
Knowing I can’t change a thing, mane...

Hook:
If I could go, if I could go
Back in the day to say the things I didn't know before...Mmmm
I could be so much better
Life would be so much better, Yeah
That would be nice right now
Thinking of opportunities that I missed out on, yeah
Take me back (me back)
Take me back (me back)
Take me back (me back)
