My spirit is willing but my flesh is weak
My eyelids grow heavy and I might just fall asleep

Walking around in my sleep
Running into walls I cannot see
Falling and scraping up my face
Ignoring the softest spoken grace

How many times will I go and take the bait
Only for this hook to rip right through my face

How can I love you back?
What can I do to show you?

His piercing eyes meet mine
Please simply stay awake.
Talk to me and I'll hear you
Don't fall asleep this time
Gotta stay awake, gotta stay awake

Don't you see me reaching for you?
I swear I really do love you.

How can I love you back?
What can I do to show you?

His piercing eyes meet mine

His piercing eyes meet mine
Please simply stay awake.
Talk to me and I'll hear you
Don't fall asleep this time
Gotta stay awake, gotta stay awake

Contemplating you is like a dream
I never want to wake up from what I finally see
Perfect circles turn in orbit
Following a perfect path from your perfect hand

When I look into your eyes
It's a world I can't believe
I can see my destiny
To be like you

Whispering fingertips
Leave your fingerprints
All over everything

Contemplating you is like a dream
I never want to wake up from what I finally see
Perfect circles turn in orbit
Following a perfect path from your perfect hand

Whispering fingertips
Leave your fingerprints
All over everything

When I look into your eyes
It's a world I can't believe
I can see my destiny
To be like you

Whispering fingertips
Leave your fingerprints
All over everything
