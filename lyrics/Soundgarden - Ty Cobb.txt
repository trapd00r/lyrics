I'm sittin' in a magic hat
With smoke and mirrors
And tire rubber fires
Watch me disappear
What made it slow you down
Sucking on a ball and chain
Another motherfucker goes down the drain

Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll
Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll

Sick in the head
Sick in the mouth
And I can't hear a word you say
Not a bit, don't  give a shit
I got the glass, I got the steel
I've got everything
All I need is your head on a stake

Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all
Just add it on to the hot rod death toll
Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all
Just add it on to the hot rod death toll

Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed
Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed
Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all
Hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all, hard headed fuck you all
Just add it on to the hot rod death toll
To the hot rod death toll
To the hot rod death toll
To the hot rod death toll
To the hot rod death toll
Yeah!
