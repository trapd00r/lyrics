Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck gettin' dirt and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity?
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a matchhead

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city

Cool town, evenin' in the city
Dressed so fine and lookin' so pretty
Cool cat lookin' for a kitty
Gonna look in ev'ry corner of the city
'Til I'm weezin' at the bus stop
Runnin' up the stairs gonna meet ya on the roof-top

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city
