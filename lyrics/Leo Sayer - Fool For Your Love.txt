Ooh, but love was just so hard to find
Until you came along into my life
And I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine
And ever since that day I've been hooked
And nothin' could tear me away
This livin' with you's like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday
Ooh, I'm reachin' the highest of highs
Every time I look in your eyes
You ask how I feel I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside
I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you want me baby
And for your love I would do anything
Ever night I'm a fool for your love, yeah
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
Hey I'm just a fool for your love
Drivin' home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
Runnin' the lights, well I wish I could fly
Just to get back faster to you
I waited all day by the telephone
Starin' at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to you hold you
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
Baby I'm just a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
Ooh, you're givin' me chills up my spine
I'm feelin' so fine, goin' out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I'll love you right up until I drop, you know
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for you love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for you love
You've got a fool on your hands baby
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool
I'm just a fool
