Time to hit the party all my girls come round
Tonight I'm feeling naughty and I can't hold it down
Cruising to the club and the joint is blowing up
I just want to dance and show you what I got

I see you look at me
Boy I like the way
Do you feel my energy?
Do you like what you see?
Cause tonight I'm going to make you say what

You love the way I dip down
Come on when I my hip for side to side
It turns you on
You love the way I dip down
Come on 
I can feel you watching me the way your body moves

I can feel you staring hypnotised by me
From my eyes to what I'm wearing
Loving every part of me
Boy you know you look so fine
If you got some time

Come and spend it with me

I see you look at me
Do you feel my energy?
Do you like what you see?
So come and spend some time with me 

You love the way I dip down
Come on when I move my hips for side to side
It turns you on
You love the way I dip down
Come on 
I can feel you watching me the way your body moves

Now is the time
For you to make a move on me
Don't hesitate my baby baby
Now this is the time 
I can make you
