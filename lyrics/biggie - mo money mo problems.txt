I'm comin' out, I'm comin'
I'm comin' out, I'm comin'

Now, who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop
Who jewels got robbed, who's mostly Dolce down

To the tube socks, the same ol pimp
Ma$e, you know ain't nuttin changed but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales pullin' all the love

You don't believe in Harlem World nigga double up
We don't play around, it's a bet lay it down
Niggaz didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the golden sound

Can't no PhD niggaz hold me down, Cooter
Schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggaz spend no dough on the booty
And then ya yell there go Ma$e, there go your cutie

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see

Yeah yeah, ahaha, it's the D to-the A to the D-D-Y
I know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops

I know you thinkin' now
When all the ballin' stops, nigga never home
Gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop

Now whatcha gonna do wit a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours
Violate me this'll be your day, we don't play and
Mess around, be D.O.A., be on your way

'Cause it ain't enough time here, ain't enough lime here
For you to shine here, deal with many women
But treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see

Uh, uh
B-I-G P-O-P-P-A
No info for the D.E.A.
Federal agents mad 'cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement

My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders

Playboy, I told ya, bring ya might to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's 'cause you run with lame dudes too much

Me lose my touch, never that
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at?
Throw your rolees in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high

While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, nigga see
B.I.G. be flossin' jig on the cover of Fortune
Five double oh, here's my phone number

Your man ain't got to know, I got the dough
Got the flow down pizzat
Platinum plus like thizzat
Dangerous on trizzacks
Leave yo' ass flizzat

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see

What's goin on?
What's goin on?
Somebody tell me
What's goin on?
What's goin on?

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see
