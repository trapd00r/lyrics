Trap trap in the bando, I don't wanna look like you
My young nigga with the Rambo, you be getting jooked right through
Gotta have scrams on the block cuh you know what the hood might do
All my 150 niggas trap cuh we don't wanna look like you

Trap trap in the bando, I don't wanna look like you
My young nigga with the Rambo, you be getting jooked right through
Gotta have scrams on the block cuh you know what the hood might do
All my 150 niggas trap cuh we don't wanna look like you

[Sneakbo:]
Look at me, look at me
I don't wanna look like you
I got a fast car on the drive
And I got a pushbike too
Us man smoke bare weed
Dem man bunning bare food
Give me one spark of the zoot
I'm about to kill this tune
Tell a boy move, man can't chat to my crew
Man can't do what I do
Man best move, when you see [?] come through
That nigga there move loose
Vroom vroom vroom, man might pull up on you
Ting go boom boom boom, now look at you
You, you, you and who?
You had too much attitude (that's right)
My niggas be clapping you
Before all the fame, I'll show you what hammers do
Don't let Capo spaz on you
Load up the something, ba ba ba ba bap on you
Free Maggie B
Free all my niggas, man, free all the Gs
Free MK, Littlez and Twigz
Real niggas like PDC
When fisherman come back home
Bare man better go home
Reckless with the big ting
Lock it down, on one road

[S-Wavey:]
Already told you niggas about the trap
Like my nigga M Dargg, I ain't run that back
7 out of 10, yeah that shit was wack
You ain't even bad, you ain't even gotta act
If I go Wooly then I'll link in Thames
Your man dem broke, go half on the ben
In a bigger whip, riding round with a skeng
With a bad bitch, yeah, her name is Gem
When I'm pushing [?] I don't mean no boxing
My dons are really tryna box em
Come through yeah on a boss ting
My man dem is clapping, your girlfriend is catting
The pagans are chatting, see anybody, we'll wrap him
Shoutout my haters in Clapham
S-Wavey, I'll definitely clap him

Never seen them in the field
But they're doing all that rap
Young nigga in the bando
Tryna count all them racks
Met your girlfriend and I slid through
Now she want a car ride back
Turn a good girl to a bad bitch
Now I want them all like that
Got pussy, got pussy, got Gucci, don't know about you
Got bitches, got bitches, they stay cause they want a round two
I was fucking his bitch for a minute and he never knew
Put my dick in the bitch, then my nigga was fucking her too
Mr doo-doo-doo, in the cut man, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, drop road, doo-doo-doo
Still up on my block, young niggas and they're savage with it
Roll around the block, big bag, no baggage in it
Don't care about the tool, blow out his belly, saw rice, bit of cabbage with it

Trap trap in the bando, I don't wanna look like you
My young nigga with the Rambo, you be getting jooked right through
Gotta have scrams on the block cuh you know what the hood might do
All my 150 niggas trap cuh we don't wanna look like you
