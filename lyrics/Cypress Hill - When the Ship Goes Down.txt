Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down

Livin' on phat pockets on flat wit tha gat
Rollin' around nine deuce Cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke ya ass if ya wanna come chat

That's why some pigs an tha kids come sweatin'
They follow a hollow point shells hard ta swallow
Why wallow when ya come ta roll on I put tha clip
An dust bring ya ass on

Kickin' dust on ya head as tha gat busts
My grip surrounded
I'm about ta get rushed I brushed wit death
How many shells stuffed in my closet [Incomprehensible]

When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When tha ship goes down)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When tha ship goes down)

When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When tha ship goes down)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(Ya better be ready)

Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down

I told tha boyz get tha sawed off glock
And tha rest of tha gats as I strapped on tha bullet-proof vest, boom
I think I got one to tha chest hot damn
I didn't want to kill a man

Shit, I still stand tall with tha hill clan y'all
Better stand back niggaz 'bout ta fall
I'm comin' out blastin' like Yosemite Sam
Get tha cheese an tha bread for tha ham

When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When tha ship goes down)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When tha ship goes down)

When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When tha ship goes down)
When tha ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(Ya better be ready)

Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
