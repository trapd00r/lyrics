Too much time thinking about all of my mistakes
My heart, my mind, my soul, my body ache
A hunger for, the loving arms of your embrace
I walk along the lonely road

I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong, girl
I'll carry the load
All the grinding time I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road

Too much time thinking about everything that went wrong
I cry my eyes out every time I hear your song
I hope this path leaves me back where I belong
I walk along the lonely road

I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong, girl
I'll carry the load
All the grinding time I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road

Too much pride, for me to up and take the blame
Weep inside girl it's killing me with pain
Every night, I sleep I call your name
I walk along the lonely road

I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong girl
I'll carry the load
All the grinding time I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road
I walk along the lonely road
My back is strong girl
I'll carry the load
I'll carry the load
All the grinding time I pay the debt that's owed
I walk along the lonely road
I walk along the lonely road
I walk along the lonely road
