Lately I have seen to see you all the time
And you allways seem to find the seat right next to mine
I think I can read, the question in your eyes
It's not hard, I might be dumb, but I ain't blind

If you really wanna know, just how I feel
Better get up your nerve and begin to talk to me
If you really wanna know, you can't be shy
So don't waste any time, you won't know until you try

Everytime you pass me by, you wave and smile
And a little bird told me I've been on your mind
You keep asking my friedns about me all the time
Forget my friends, say don't know, but I don't mind

If you really wanna know, just how I feel
Better get up your nerve and begin to talk to me
If you really wanna know, you can't be shy
So don't waste any time, you won't know, until you try

So if you really wanna know, just how I feel
Better get up your nerve and begin to talk to me
If you really wanna know, you can't be shy
So don't waste any time, you won't know until you try

So don't waste any time, you won't know
If you really wanna know, just how I feel
Don't waste any time, you won't know until you try
