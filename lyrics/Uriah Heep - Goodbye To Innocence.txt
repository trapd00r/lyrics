9 o' clock on Monday morning, always runnin' late
Prior to commitments, she would always miss the gate
Now it was pretty obvious that she was teacher's pet
But just like any teenage boy we took what we could get

To say goodbye to innocence
What she's teachin' you don't learn at school
So say goodbye to innocence
She's breakin' all the rules
And she's nobody's fool

Turning up for classes, she was never there on time
And what she had been up to was on every school boy's mind
Young imaginations left to wonder can go wild
But she was no delinquent, she was just a wild child

To say goodbye to innocence
What she's teachin' you don't learn at school
So say goodbye to innocence
She's breakin' all the rules
And she's nobody's fool

Every school has got one but they're sometimes hard to see
Flirtatious confrontations always been the death of me
Now you could make her master class if she gives you the glance
But if you're late make no mistake, there'll be no second chance

To say goodbye to innocence
What she's teachin' you don't learn at school
So say goodbye to innocence
She's breakin' all the rules
And she's nobody's fool
