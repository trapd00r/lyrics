I think I was wrong
I think you were right
That all my angry words
Will keep me up at night
And through the old screen door
I still can hear you say
"Oh, Honey won't you stop
Treating me that way?"

If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
'Cause babe I've changed

Tell it to me slow
Tell me with your eyes
If anyone should know
How to let it slide
I swear I can see you
Coming up the drive
And there ain't nothing like regret
To remind you you're alive

If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
'Cause babe I've changed

I crossed the canyon a thousand times
But never noticed what was mine
What you'll remember of me tonight
Well, it almost makes me cry
Yeah, it almost makes me cry

Oh, ballbreaking moon and ridiculing stars
Oh, the older I get, the closer you are
Don't you got somewhere that you need to be?
Instead of hanging here making a fool of me

If you could only see
What love has made of me
Then I'd no longer be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see the change in me
If you could only see
What love has made of me
But I'll forever be in your mind
The difficult kind
But you won't see
No you won't see
The good in me
But babe I've changed
Cause babe I've changed
