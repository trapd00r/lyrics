Hey, yo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, shut up and listen

I'm not the artist they're gonna turn to a puppet
I've been myself in the darkness and I'm the same way in public
Guess I'm a target 'cause they aren't in charge of what they are stuck with
I wear my heart on my arm and spill the guts out my stomach
All of a sudden I'm hunted 'cause they don't like what I said
But only dummies would choose to follow a wolf that was dead
Tear the flesh off of your bones and keep your ghost in my head
You lookin' just like a clown and I'm the bull in the pen
And the labels aren't able to get in touch when they call
'Cause I know all the A&R's and I'm ignorin' 'em all
Don't need a manager to help me, I keep blowin' 'em off
And all the rappers who doubted me, I've been provin' 'em wrong
They wanna give me a record deal to control me officially
'Cause as long as I ain't signed I'll keep exposin' the industry
And they know if I put my name on that line it's a victory
Then they'll censor my message and try to rewrite my history
I don't need the publicity, I need all of my friends
To know if I disappear tomorrow it's because of them
They don't want you in power, they want you willin' to spend
All of your money on products so that they get their percent
But I'm a different breed of person, liquor seepin' through the surface
Try and cut me and I'll drink the blood, the stitch is leakin' bourbon
And my fans are amazin', I officially deserve 'em
I'll effectively eliminate and burn who tries to hurt 'em
This my element, the weapons and the skeletons are evidence
Of everything I did while I defended what was delicate
Machete blades and severed heads and human teeth are necklaces
Electric fences hummin' through the night while I'm confessin'

That I am, whatever you say I am
It makes no difference to me, if you won't shake my hand
I got my freedom of speech and I will make my stand
I will never take a seat to please the mainstream plan
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
It doesn't matter to me, if you guys see my plan
You are my gasoline and I'm the flame you fan
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm just a person who ain't afraid of the scrutiny
I'm not scared of the truth and so through that there's immunity
And my dreams aren't only somethin' I experience lucidly
They are what I've accomplished and what I'm 'bout to do musically
Save the cars and the jewelry, you know I can't be bothered
With all that superficial garbage, I'm a actual artist
I only do this for therapy, not to fill up my wallet
They poppin' Xanax to party, a party's not what I call it
I call it drug-addicted rappers if I'm perfectly honest
I call it numbin' of the pain of bein' chained to the bottom
Of a ship that's sinkin' quick inside a Promethazine bottle
They say it's lit, but it's really just a sickness that they swallow
And they can't mold me, they can't change me, 'cause I'll only use to save me
And I'll stay me 'til they hate me, or the pressure drive me crazy
I've been medicated, hated myself, and couldn't escape it
Now I face what I'm afraid of, embrace all the confrontation
While my name keep comin' up in all the same conversations
"He's pathetic, he's a racist, he's a vulture, man, I hate him"
"I don't get it, he's so basic, and the culture should replace him"
"I'ma take him off the playlist" and I just laugh while they complainin'

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
It makes no difference to me, if you won't shake my hand
I got my freedom of speech and I will make my stand
I will never take a seat to please the mainstream plan
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
It doesn't matter to me, if you guys see my plan
You are my gasoline and I'm the flame you fan
I don't know, it's just the way I am
