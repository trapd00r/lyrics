Yo Biz, let's send this out to the propmaster Kool DJ Red Alert
Bring the beat in, Todd
Yeah, this is how we're doing it for the '93, we're on the smooth tip
Ha ha, yo Biz, kick something funky for 'em, word up

Now people always want to know my strategy plan
For me to use the weird name as "Diabolical Man"
Well I got diabolical beats, raggedy clothes
And aw hell, I'm even wearing diabolical drawers
I'm not White as Barry cauce I'm Dirtier than Harry
With a rap that's big and fat that Mariah couldn't Carey
So don't come to me with that same ol' same ol'
'Cause I'll knock your butt somewhere over the rainbow
I write rhymes that jam more than jelly
So call me the Arthur without the Fonzarelli, or Nelly
'Cause I am so bad when it comes to a rap jam
Even robins scream, "Holy hip-hop Biz man!"
I grab the microphone and go every which way but loose
'Cause I'm the ugly ducking that seduces Mother Goose
And I don't be using flipping tongue twisters
But I still get better in time like The Whispers
But older crews you see can't stay as loose as me
Cause old school rappers just ain't what they used to be
So up your nose with a rubber hose
And every brother knows that your style's older than my grandma's clothes
But gray skies is going to clear up, so put on a happy face
Take off that frown and chear up, and put on a happy face, cause
