[Intro:]
[Dr Dre:]
Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S. 

[Eminem:]
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fucking right! 

[Dr Dre:]
To the rap mobile, let's go! 

[Lady:]
Marshall! 
Marshall! 

[Eminem:]
Bitches and Gentleman! 
It's showtime! 
Hurry, hurry step right up! 
Introducing the star of our show, his name is... 

[Lady:]
Marshall! 

[Eminem:]
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now 
So without futher ado, I bring to you... 

[Lady:]
Marshall! 

[Verse #1:]
Your bout to witness hip hop in its 
Most purest, most rawest form flow, almost flawless 
Most hardest, most honest, known artist 
Chip off the old block but old doc is back! 
Looks like Batman, brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his on pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges 
Oranges, peach, pairs, plums, syringes
[VRRM VRRM] Yeah, here I come 
I'm inches away from you, here fear none 
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so 

[Chorus 2x:]
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around what is this? 
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down 
On these clowns, can i get a witness? 

[Dr Dre:]
Hell Yeah 

[Verse #2:]
Dre gotta move fast, gotta perform mirracles 
Gee willycores Dre, holly bad syllables 
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham 
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals 
So, skip to your loo, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it was till everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say it hate it
On an eighties songs and 
exagerate it all So much
they make it all up 
There's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans 
It just means so much more to so much more 
People when you rapping and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll 
To Marshall and Andre's carnival 
C'mon, now! 

[Chorus 2x:]

[Verse #3:]
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo 
Two old friends, why panic? 
You allready know whos capable, the two caped heroes 
Dial straight down the center 8 0 0 
You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and Elton, play career russian roulett 
And never even seen me blinging get me busting a sweat 
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely 
Ease over these beats, and be so breezy 
Jesus, how can shit be so easy 
How can one Sandra be so leavy
Turn on these beats MC's dont see me 
Believe me, BET and MTV 
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo sheezy 
Can't leave rap alone the game easy 
'Til we grow beirds, get weird and disappear into the mountains 
Nothing but clowns down here 
But we, ain't fucking around round here 
Yo Dre! 

[Dr Dre:]
Whuddup? 

[Eminem:]
Can I get a hell yeah? 

[Dr Dre:]
Hell Yeah 

[Chorus 2x:]

[Outro:]

[Eminem:]
So there you have it folks 

[Lady:]
Marshall! 

[Eminem:]
Has come to save the day 
Back with his friend Andre 
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because 

[Lady:]
Marshall! 

[Eminem:]
And Andre are here to stay and never go away 
Until our dying day, until we're old and grey 

[Lady:]

[Eminem:]
So until next times friends 
Same blonde hair, same rap channel 
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming 
Your host for the evening 

[Lady:]

[Eminem:]
