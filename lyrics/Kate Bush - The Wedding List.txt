No I'll never give the hunt up
And I won't muck it up
Somehow this was it I knew
Maybe fate wants you dead too
We've come together in the very same room
And I'm coming for you

Do you think I'd ever letcha
Get away with it, huh?
He swooned in warm maroon
There's gas in your barrel
And I'm flooded with doom
You've made a wake of our honeymoon
And I'm coming for you

All of the headlines said "Passion Crime"
"Newly Weds Groom Shot Dead Mystery Man"
God help the bride
She's a widow all in red
With his red still wet

She said
"I'll put him on the wedding list
I'll put him on the wedding list
I'll get him and I will not miss"

Now as I'm coming for you
All I see is Rudi
I die with him again and again
And I'll feel good in my revenge
I'm gonna fill your head with lead
And I'm coming for you

When it's all over you'll roll over
The butt of my gun
One in your belly and one for Rudi
You got what you gave by the heel of my bootie
Bang-bang out like an old cherootie
I'm coming for you

All of the headlines said "Passion Crime"
"Newly Weds Groom Shot Dead Mystery Man"
God help the bride
She's a widow all in red
With his red still wet

And she sure got him on the wedding list
I got him on the wedding list
I got him and I did not miss
I pinned him on the wedding list

After she shot the guy
She committed suicide
(I'm coming Rudi)
And later when they analysed
They found a little one inside
It must have been Rudi's child
(I shot shot shot him honey)
Never mind she got the guy
(He hit the ground Rudi)
An eye for an eye
(Ashes to ashes, dust)
An eye for an eye
(I hit him hit him)
An eye for an eye
(Rudi)

Eye for an eye
(Rudi)
(I'm coming coming coming honey)
Eye for an eye
(Rudi)
