All my life
All my time
Oh it's got a price
Oh gonna pay for mine

I know you really care X2

Oll my friends they got
Old apathy in the brain
They got no ideas in their heads
They got no path that I can't see
Don't you think that I don't blame them
Don't you think that I can't shame them
Don't you think that I don't want them
Don't you think that I ain't one of them
One of them X3

I know you really care X3...

You're just another exile X8
