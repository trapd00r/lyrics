I heard you on the wireless back in '52
Lying awake intent on tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through

They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machines on new technology
And now I understand the problems you can see

I met your children
What did you tell them?
Video killed the radio star

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seemed so long ago
Do you remember the jingles used to go

You were the first one
You were the last one
Video killed the radio star

In my mind and in my car, we can't rewind we've gone too far
Pictures came and broke your heart, put the blame on VCR
(Video killed the radio star)
