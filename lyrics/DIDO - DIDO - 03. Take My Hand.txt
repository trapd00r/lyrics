Everytime I walk away
It feels so wrong
Tell me why
I'll never stay 
Where I belong

oh Take me home
I dream of the dawn 
in the blue of your eyes
oh Take me home

Chorus
What keeps me loving you
It's easy to know 
when we touch
What keeps me loving you
It's easy to know
When it's love

Everytime I say goodbye
I can't be free
So tell me why
I never try
To let it be

oh Take my hand
Tomorrow will come
if you hold me tonight
oh take my hand

Chorus

What keeps me loving you

I dream of the dawn 
in the Blue of your eyes

What keeps me loving you

What keeps me loving you




Take me home
together we're strong

Chorus
