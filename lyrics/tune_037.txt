I've been waiting for so long,
For someone just like me.
Stuck between right and wrong,
This fucked up fantasy.
I've got nothing but blood,
To let the wrong one in.
Lost in the garden of lust,
It's an original sin.

She came after me,
With a pocket knife.
Stuck here in a dream,
Nightmare of my life.
Nothing left to do,
Just sit there and scream.
Wake up next to you,
And try to go back to sleep.
Try to go back to sleep.

I've been waiting for so long,
For someone just like you.
Tell me your favorite song,
I'll sing a different tune.
I've got nothing but blood,
Upon these hands of mine.
Let you out in the sun,
You hung me out to dry.

She came after me,
With a pocket knife.
Stuck here in a dream,
Nightmare of my life.
Nothing left to do,
Just sit there and scream.
Wake up next to you,
And try to go back to sleep.

Whoa, whoa.
Baby you've got some nerve.
Whoa, whoa.
Cold revenge has been served.
Whoa, whoa.
And I'm freezing alone
Whoa, whoa.
For reasons unknown.

She came after me,
With a pocket knife.
Stuck here in a dream,
Nightmare of my life.
Nothing left to do,
Just sit there and scream.
Wake up next to you,
And try to go back to sleep,

And try to go back to sleep,
And try to go back to sleep.
