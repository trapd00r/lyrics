No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Listen, little child, there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
You know there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me

Goodbye, my friend 
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end 
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it 
Time will never change it, no, no, no

No, no, no, no

Just a little girl, big imagination
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world (Into the world), what a revelation
She found there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye, my friend 
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end 
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it 
Time will never change it, no, no, no

No, no, no, no (You know it's time to say goodbye)

The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

Goodbye, my friend 
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end 
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never, never ever change it

No, no, no, no (You know it's time to say goodbye)
No, no, no, no (And don't forget you can rely)
No, no, no, no (You know it's time to say goodbye, and don't forget, on me you can rely)
No, no, no, no (I will help, help you on your way, I will be with you every day)

No, no, no, no (I will be with you every day)
