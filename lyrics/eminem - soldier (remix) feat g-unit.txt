I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Da da da da da 
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo 

Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug kept shit appealing
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
Never lived to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if its true
If it's you, what you say in your raps is what you do
So they feel, it's part of ya obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets face to face are you for real?
The confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, if you can conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it
'Til its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze 

I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble

I love pissing you off, it get's me off
Like my lawyers, when the fucking judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'm violating. All the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch is news
Pistol whipping mother fucker bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it You sweat bullets 
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better, cause instead of you murdering
You can hurt 'em then come back again and kick dirt in them
It's like pouring salt in your wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits as soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody's hearts just stop, they call the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking at the Hot Rock's parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether its your fault or not cause

I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I can do it
Don't even try, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spill the illest shit ever could drive me to it
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Mother fuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
And Lord have mercy on anymore of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity 

I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier - these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier - even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never stumble
