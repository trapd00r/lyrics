Running with my rain face on
Today I woke up feeling sad
I know that you said
That one day I would be glad

Oh, the choirs of winter
Birds are calling
To me and
All the leaves I came to love
Are falling

Ribbons on evergreen
Owls that pull them apart
I can hear you singing, my funny valentine
Oh, you know that breaks my heart

Choirs of winter
Birds are calling
To me and
All the leaves I came to love
Oh, you know that breaks my heart

Running with my rain face on
No idea of what to say
No idea of what to do
In this fear that never goes away

All my dreams where here
All my dreams, my tears
All my dreams where here
All my dreams

Oh, you know that breaks my heart
