Well I know things haven't been 
Working out too well lately 
I want too many dreams 
To drown in your wishing well 

And I heard you crying in the chapel 
On this great big happy sunny day 
And I know I live in a jungle 
Somethings never change 

I believed for much too long 
Friday night ball and chain 
And even if our colours fade 
I know now 

And I heard you crying in the chapel 
On this great big happy sunny day 
And I know I live in the jungle 
Somethings never change 

oooohhh yeah 
mmmm mmm mmm ya 

Well I know things haven't been 
Working out too well lately 
I want too many dreams 
To drown in your wishing well 


And I heard you crying in the chapel 
On this great big happy sunny day 
And I know I live in the jungle 
Somethings never change 

I heard you crying in the chapel 
On this great big sunny day 
I know I heard you in the chapel 
Somethings never change 

I heard you crying in the chapel 
On this great big sunny day 
I know I heard you in the chapel 
Somethings never change (fade)
