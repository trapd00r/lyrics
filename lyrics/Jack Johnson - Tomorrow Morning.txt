Well that's alright, if that's alright
Two thousand miles but still that's alright
And that's alright, if that's alright
I'll see you in the mornin', if that's alright

What would you do if I wrote you a song?
Would you give me some lovin' when I get home?
Or would you be mad at me if I had a hard time gettin' a hold of you
I try all the time

And I'll bet that
You don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wonderin' where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow mornin' comes

And what would you do if I sang you this song?
The connection is bad but that's only the phone
'Cause when my words kiss your ear
I'll be right there
The message is long 'cause baby this is your song

I'll bet that
You don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wonderin' where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow mornin'...

I'll bet that
You don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wonderin' where I'm at
Well I'll be home home when tomorrow morning..
And that's alright
'Cause I'll be home when tomorrow morning..
And that's alright
'Cause I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes
