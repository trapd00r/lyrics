Well I couldnt let go of the day just yet
These thoughts in my head
Keep me from my bed

And these walls are glarin' Down at me
All alone
In the dim
My tears
They shed

Yeah

And my heart leaps out of its Bars
Will tomorrow be much worse
Is this love a blessing or a curse?

And all i know
Is that I
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

Well I couldnt let go of the night just yet
These feelings I share
Circle round in my head
And the time is ticking on the wall
Only seems
To get a second silence in this bed

Yeah

And my heart leaps out of its Bars
Will tomorrow be much worse
Is this love a blessing or a curse?

But all i know
Is that I
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
