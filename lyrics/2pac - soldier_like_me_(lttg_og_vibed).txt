[Intro: 2Pac]
So what I'm gonna do, hopefully is... I wanna be, uhm not a wannabe I am 2Pac Shakur!

2Pac!
2005!
Guess who's back? G-G-Guess who's back?
G-G-Guess who's back? G-G-Guess who's back?
Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Posse deep as I role through the streets
Muthafuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so long you think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beat, I'm robbin' niggas through the teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play tuffy
Last time them niggas rushed me, I ain't bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me, ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buck shots
Them niggas got enough knots, I'm poppin' corrupt cops
You muthafuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Muthafuckin' Soldier, ready to role & take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Role to the door, through a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' 'cause wouldn't stop until they rugged out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's & them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
20 cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin' to keep a nigga down, but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped, I'm a Soldier.

[Chorus:]
I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G 'cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do 'cause that ain't you, you just frontin'.
You ain't?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
It's 2Pac in the mad bitch
In them .64 rag on them things, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghosts on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the backseat, nigga when we clown.
Homey is you down?
B got the strap & she anxious
Hurry up 'fo she spank shit
Comin' round the corners, spittin' rounds
They payin' homey down
Caught them sucker ass bitches outta bounce.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day.
Stinkin' biatch!

[Chorus:]
I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G 'cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do 'cause that ain't you, you just frontin'.
You ain't? (2Pac)

[Outro: 2Pac]
Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.

Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

Everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.
