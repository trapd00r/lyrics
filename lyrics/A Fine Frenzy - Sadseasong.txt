Sea is always changing
Rearranging
Rains came without warning
Stormy storming

Vessel once so mighty
I held on tightly
But waves, they played like giants
Water lions

Down down down how I miss you now
Down down down how I miss you now

Life without a witness
Is a lonely business
No one here to rise with, none to lie with

Wish it were a bad dream
Sad sea, sad dream
Wish I could awake
