Well everybody knows about Hollywood skunks
Soulful saints and funky monks
My tinsel town is made of steel
Let's twist and shout, let's make a deal!

Hollywood or Hollywood not
Immortalizing on the spot
Never sold out always in stock
Are you deaf or does this rock?!

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
Lookin' for the teacher, Sikamikanico
Never gonna reach her, Sikamikanico

Don't you know 'bout Frank Sinatra
That I'm gonna 'cause I gotta,
We don't just play, we display!
Got to get it up, gonna do it my way!

I shimmy my sex into the cave
You might receive my radio wave
Shake it girl, you won't get hurt
I knock my dick into the dirt

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
Lookin' for the preacher, Sikamikanico
If we're gonna reach her, Sikamikanico

Anybody want some, Sikamikanico
Everybody on the run, Sikamikanico
Rock and roll reason, Sikamikanico
Never gonna treason, Sikamikanico

Hey, Ho, Let's go
The flow of the fro, wanna - a giggolo
Let them know that the timber low eskimo had to go,
Find a ho, to sit upon my big toe
Hey Joe, a radio dope, yo
Is never gonna overthrow my Hollywood bungalow
Oh no, it will not bleed, my nose, that you blow
Hey ho, let's go

So paperboy said you are bad news
Sweet child of mine would be confused
It's plain to see we rock the groove
If you don't like it, time to move!

You're not the press, you don't amaze me
I'm not your dick so don't appraise me
Never gonna fit your critical shit
You better watch out, you might get hit

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
Lookin' for the teacher, Sikamikanico
Never gonna reach her, Sikamikanico

Anybody want some, Sikamikanico
Everybody on the run, Sikamikanico
Rock and roll reason, Sikamikanico
Never gonna treason, Sikamikanico
