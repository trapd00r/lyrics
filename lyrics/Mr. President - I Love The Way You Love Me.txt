REFRAIN:
To hold you
To feel you
To keep us stay together
To kiss you
To need you
Is what I'd wish forever
I love the way you love me
I love your way can't you see?

TELEPHONE CALL:
Hey baby it's me
What you doinÂ´ right now
Yeah I'd love to come to see
You but I don't know how
I'm really busy,
And I ain't got time
Yeah you know that
You're always on my mind
When I get time I'll
Be around to see you
Oh baby, you know
That I miss you too
What would you say
To a candle light dinner
Call me soon I'm your winner
