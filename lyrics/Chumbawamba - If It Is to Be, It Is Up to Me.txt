If it is to be, it is up to me [repeats]

And as we sail, blows wild the gale
And as we sail, blows wild the gale

If it is to be, it is up to me [repeats]

Sweet flows the water
Yellow as royal piss
Speech turns to stammer
Your lips are too tight to kiss
I've never seen rabbits
Looking as scared as this

And as we sail, blows wild the gale

If it is to be, it is up to me [repeats]

And as we sail, blows wild the gale
And as we sail, blows wild the gale

If it is to be, it is up to me [repeats]

A five times champion
Wouldn't row as fast
Caught in the eddies
Between future and past
Blowing a hurricane
From the Royal arse

And as we sail, blows wild the gale

If it is to be, it is up to me [repeats]

And as we sail, blows wild the gale
And as we sail, blows wild the gale
