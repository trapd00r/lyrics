Working Monday through Friday takes up all of my time;
If I can get to the weekend, everything will work out just fine...
That's when I can go crazy, that's when I can have fun;
Time to be with my baby, time to come undone...

Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to free my soul...
Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to lose control...
Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to free my soul...
Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to lose control...

Couldn't wait to get older, thought I'd have so much fun;
I guess I'm one of the grown-ups, now I have to get the job done...
People give me the business - I'm not living in fear,
I'm just living in chaos, gotta get away from here...

Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to free my soul...
Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to lose control...
Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to free my soul...
Where's the party? (Where's the party?) I want to lose control...

Don't want to grow old too fast, don't want to let the system get me down;
I've got to find a way to make the good times last, and if you'll show me how - I'm ready now!

Slow down you move too fast, gonna make the good times last,
Gonna let my hair hang down - I'm ready now!
Slow down you move too fast, gonna make the good times last,
Gonna let my hair hang down - I'm ready now!

Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
Someone tell me, where's the party? (Where's the party?)
Come on, come on, come on... where's the party? (Where's the party?)

Don't want to grow old too fast, don't want to let the system get me down;

We can make it all right, we can make you dance, we can make your party last all night...
We can make it all right, we can make you dance, we can make your party last all night...

(Go madonna!)
