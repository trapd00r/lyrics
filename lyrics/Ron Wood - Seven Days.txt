Seven days, seven more days she'll be comin'
I'll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive

She been gone ever since I been a child
Ever since I seen her smile, I ain't forgotten her eyes.
She had a face that could outshine the sun in the sky

Kissing in the valley
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way.
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
And the night always brighter than the day

Oh, seven days, seven more days that are connected
Just like I expected, she'll be comin' on strong
Seven more days, all that'll be gone

Well, kissing in the valley
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
And the night always brighter than the day

Oh, seven days, seven more days she'll be comin'
I'll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive
Oh, seven more days, all I gotta do is survive
Oh, seven more days, all I gotta do is survive
Oh, seven more days, all I gotta do is survive
