Couldn't lie to myself again
When I know we'll meet much faster
And I couldn't lie to you again
When I know the war you're after

We couldn't save ourselves from this
Got a world spinning backwards
But I wouldn't wait for time to cease to exist
To know what comes after

I'm not walking away from you
I'm not, I'm not walking away from you
