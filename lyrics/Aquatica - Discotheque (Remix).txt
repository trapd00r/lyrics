"stripping silence in my mind
wondering how i was so blind
with crowded motions, surrownded by ocean
i'm looking into the eyes of god
and i feel alive

i like when you play with my mind
you take all my dreams for a ride
when you share all the things that you hide
i like when you play with my mind

when you let your emotions play
when my thoughts want to fly away
when i hear all the sounds you say
is when i like that you play with my mind

when you let your emotions play
when my thoughts want to fly away
when i hear all the sounds you say
there's no place i want to stay
i like that you play with my mind".
