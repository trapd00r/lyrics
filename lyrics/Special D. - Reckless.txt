I see the sky is falling
Down to the beauty ground,
Wipe away tear drops slowly,
I feel a lonely sound.
Memories fade and drifting,
Back to reality,
Save the last hope,
Deep inside of me.
Keep the faith you will see,
You still can believe in me,
Keep the faith I will be,
All that you need from me.
Covering shameless motions,
Nothing abscurs my life,
Longing for you forgive me,
I scream there's no reply.
Memories end up asking,
Am I the 'Queen of Pain',
Kiss me, bless me,
Stop this celebrate.
Keep the faith you will see,
You still can believe in me,
Keep the faith I will be,
All that you need from me.
You need from me.
Keep the faith you will see,
You still can believe in me,
Keep the faith I will be,
All that you need from me.
You need from me.
