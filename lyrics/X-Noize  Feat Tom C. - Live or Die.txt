like the wheel of misfortune
like the hands that have sinned
i walk around and beside you
never noticed you damaged skin

like the lies you are spreadingare
are the same you were told
i walk around and beside you
and you skin feel so cold

i'm caught inside your web again
slowly loosing my sight
i'm always running torwards the bright light
shoudn't keep going but i might
yes i might

now spin the wheel of misfortune
now it's you that have sinned
you walk around and beside me
still i can't seem to win

i'm caught inside your web again
slowly loosing my sight
i'm always running towards the bright light
shouldn't keep going but i might

i am falling to your web again
slowly loosing my sight
running towards the bright light
shoudn't keep going but i might
yes i might
