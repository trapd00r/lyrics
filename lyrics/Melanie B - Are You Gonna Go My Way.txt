Never knew I’d feel this way babe, I feel so easy.
Never thought I’d see the day when I’d walk so tall
Now I think about it, you make me take a fall.
But worrying about it, don’t seem so smart, smart at all.
So stay another day, just stay.
You put summer in my soul, you got me on a roll.
So stay another day now.
If you stay it’s gonna be blue skies all the way.
Remember why I took so long, so long to find you.
I know I took a few wrong turns and I lost my way.
Baby you’re the one thing I call my lucky break.
Maybe we got something, something that’s been worth the wait.
So stay another day, just stay.
You put summer in my soul, you got me on a roll.
So stay another day now.
If you stay it’s gonna be blue skies all the way.
Wherever we go, just as long I know I know I got you the skies will be glorious blue.
Wont you stay another day? Come on and stay.
You put summer in my soul, you got me on a roll.
So stay another day now.
If you stay it’s going to be blue skies all...
