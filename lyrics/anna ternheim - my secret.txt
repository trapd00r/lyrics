Today must have been one of the strangest days
Some would say that you won't find love that way
The best days are not planned by common sense
By lack of time
You just happen to be where everything feels fine

It's a new secret i have found

From today i'll change my priorities around
I'm no longer in command, and people say
I'm off solid ground and you're to blame
But they don't understand, people never do
It's confusing, i don't expect them to

It's a new secret i have found

Today must have been one of the strangest days
I found a place where i could stay
And people say that it will kill me,
But they don't understand
People never do, but it makes sense to me
To be senseless to change my plans for you

It's a new secret i have found

And i'm off solid grounds for you
