Steppin' up in the club
All tooled up like a thug
Rub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-rub-a-dub-dub

I light up like a genie and I blow up on this song
Aladdin; no kiddin', boy I need a rub
Me and my speakers speak in sub, sub, sub
You know who I am, I run this fuckin' club
Dub-a-dub-a-dub-a-dub, club-a-club-a-love-a-love

Basslines and ass anything fast
Humpin' on my leg
Yo, I'm the fuckin' best
Making your money last
Hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast throw it in the bag

Basslines and cars anything fast
Know who I am, run this fuckin' club
Speaker speakin' sub
Throwin' fire like a mob
Flash, bang, thunder
Demolition job

M-I-A, You know who I am

I can nail a sound and that shit will make you jump
I can smash a beat so that track will make you run
I'm tooled up to the tee, I tie up just for fun
Get ready for the steady of stream weights by the ton
