I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
I'm not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
I'm not the road that you think when you lookin' for a short cut
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
I ain't the money man, which your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dish rag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone

I'm not the the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride, you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Like the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
Because I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That your scheming to check out
Unless your looking to check out (Shot, shot, shot)
What a mess now (C'mon)

Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone

I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and telling me I changed
Dam right I fucking changed
When there's fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it

Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till its gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
Till it's gone
But what can I do if I do till its gone
