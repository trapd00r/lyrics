Jedi Mind Tricks... Canibus
Yo
I grab Mics bust the raw
Take flight adjust the Yaw
Break your bicuspid with your own jaw
Metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born
Technically you don't even exist, God
A flick of the wrist, you'll be gone
Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm
I'm an enigma I rip bars
Or burn your star with 5 points
Plus the mic I ripped thus far
I stomp on ya forehead
Peel the top of your fucking face off like an orange
And eat the carnage
My God that sounds horrid, eating MC's
Is like eating garbage they make me vomit
Discombobulate prostates re-hydrate dry lakes
Wipe Ammonium Nitrate across the side of ya face
Anthropomorph, illogically speaking I'm out of ya league
Who can match the Bident with my top speed
Scourge of the earth, verses are merged into dirt
Heart line is flat lined through the therapy era
Sentences go through re-synthesis
I leave 'em looking bleaker than Memphis
Without Rockefeller membership
Don't be an optimist and try to rock with Bis
You end up in an iced-out sarcophagus

(Vinnie Paz)
Every rapper better fear me
'Cause Vinnie Paz is a beast
And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace
You trying ta walk through the fog where sun leaks
Ya trying to walk two dogs with one leash
You can't overstand the mathematics
How rip I bars, walk through walls perform magic
Tibetan Black Magic, I'm a warlord
I'll stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard
I'm a born lord, I was baptised
To see the universal through a cats eyes
Here come the black skies;
It's all darkness
I breathe life into Jesus Christ's carcass!

(Canibus)
Once I duct tape ya to the front of a Mack trucks, face ya
Drive through a brick wall, pull the parkin' brake up
Ask you for you proof of registration, say what?
I can't understand a word you saying, you fuck!
Peel you off till you drop on the floor
Drag you to the manifold,
Make you put your mouth around the exhaust
Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough
I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off
I'm in for hardcore Hiphop, the surrogate father
Protecting rap like the exoskeleton of a Lobster
I'll moonwalk on water, harpoon jackers
And drag 'em back to the harbour for the local photographers
Now point four fingers and watch through binoculars
Look what Harry Potter did to Andrew Galotti, Kid
Whether enemies exchange negative energy
But you can't forgive and forget with an elephant memory
'Cause You-Know-Who snatched the mic from You-Know-Who
But lets keep that between me and you!
Me and JMT,
Rippers that'll rip your ass
I got an empty mag- Get 'em Vinnie Paz!

(Vinnie Paz)
I get a bloodlust when I see a slug bust
Hit your mug with a .38 snub and watch the blood rush
Nothings above us, y'all better back off
'Cause you a devil like the Canaanite in Sackcloth
We busting Gats off
It's a clean kill
It doesn't seem real when your spleen spill
So listen to what I'm spittin' at y'all
La illaha, il Allah il Allah
Come on y'all your getting hit in the chest
'Cause Vinnie Pazienz and Canibus is the best
Ripping the rest
And all y'all seek is ashes
I love reading Koran in pitch blackness
I love reading the psalms to bitch actors
I love reading the palms of bitch rappers!>
