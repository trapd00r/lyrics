I think I'll be okay
Another dis, another day
You left me standing like a stranger without a face
I think I lost control
I feel my head is in slow mo'
Infatuation leads right to emotion overload

Temptation, frustration

I know everybody wants you
It's not a temporary issue
Just once I think I'd like to see you
Get it on with me
I know everybody wants you
It's not a temporary issue
Just once I think I'd like to see you
Get it on with me
Get it on with me

The methods that you use
Just make me more and more confused
Anxiety has got me tiptoeing around the fuse
I'm trying not to bend
I'm playing like I'm hard to get
With all this pressure I will wind up snapping in the end

Temptation, frustration

I know everybody wants you
It's not a temporary issue
Just once I think I'd like to see you
Get it on with me
I know everybody wants you
It's not a temporary issue
Just once I think I'd like to see you
Get it on with me

I'm in control
But you don't know
Where do we go?

I know everybody wants you
It's not a temporary issue
Just once I think I'd like to see you
Get it on with me
I know everybody wants you
It's not a temporary issue
This time I think I wanna see you
Get it on with me
Get it on with me
Get it on with me
