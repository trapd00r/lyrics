Me and my love on a lazy Saturday
Eating oysters, candle light and a bottle of chardonnay
Cruise and a kiss
We're on our way to bed
When his phone began to ring
And it's you again

I'm not prepared to share my man with no one else
The morning sun is shining bright,
The postman rides his yellow bike
He finds you dead down in a ditch
So leave my man alone you bitch

Went to this party, me and my lovely man
Wearing my finest dress
And my mood was the best.
We took a little dance with my hands inside his pants
You again interrupting:
"Can I take you from him?"
I'm not prepared to share my man with no one else.

I'm not prepared to share my man with no one else
The morning sun is shining bright,
The postman rides his yellow bike
He finds you dead down in a ditch
So leave my man alone you bitch
