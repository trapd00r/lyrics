-Told you a story once, 'Made a measure' the theme, under
Pressure with dreams.
-Aderlessens and fiens
-Learned lessons indeed, the sound was allright-
-Had a taperecorder, on pause to make it tighter
-Had a lighter iiin the air, even during 'Resume'. Alcohol and hey,
Filling the beautiful way, the suitable way.
-We had women seduced, cold VoodooLab floor while my
People produced. People read the news;
-Sherlock be out bombin.
-Still calm on the charts without cash or stardom. 
Bonded with natrual fellas;
-The rap guerilla, -Standing by the railroad and thyming accapellas.
-Dwellas on the 'green line', devine,
Time Breathing, -The retro all over the metro across Sweden.
-The pee keeps feeding the heads so 'fuck ya'!
-Didn't think we'd rock hard? I'ma make ya recall; Style thorough.
Added the salt to stay raw,
-Like a badass whore who just padded her bra. 
-And when the rapper's feel fragile and far from the hardest;
-That's when the facts are bleeding, and takes you back from
where you started.

Chorus:
-Yo, Pee! I walk the fire for you! -That's what you ought to do,
Ru! I walk the fire for you.
- That's what you ought to do, Pee! I walk the fire for you, so c'mon;
Fire walk with me! Fire walk with me!

-The heat's on fire, sparking flames like a lighter. _still egnite ya,
Won't fight ya. -But delight ya.
-Exite ya, step into my Magic Villa chilling. -Tall building on top
Of the hill fulfilling.
Killing the 'B/S' for my squad and empire. -And light a torch for
The reals at the camp fire.
-The champs, physicaly amped to spot biters. -Allright then,
Love to Tee, Diaz and N-Light-N,
We're reaping the crops-from both sides of the border check the chaos.
-Natrual bond, rap marauders.
Predicted to shine several times a decade. -Pee the rhyming
Executive, bound to stay payed,
Nowadays made, played dues with Sherlock.
The Scanian half Dane linked with Thomas Rusiak,
the Polac -In business hot like Adrak, -yo Ru, it's time to
Stack that and stuff it like a tampac.
-Hile you fantasize about combat, full metal, we stay, settle
The scores, whores, they hate us some more.
-Hate us even more, you still wont understand, -The caps we
Peal's the one on top of the can; on warpath.

Chorus:
-Yo, Pee! I walk the fire for you! -That's what you ought to do,
Ru! I walk the fire for you.
- That's what you ought to do, Pee! I walk the fire for you, so c'mon;
Fire walk with me! Fire walk with me!
