One less thing to fear
Come take me for a ride now
Ain't that just what friends are for
Cold comfort in the crossfire
I'm gonna need a miracle
Confused and distorted, it's all very well
Ring up the curtain, descend into hell
Too late for your shadow, one less thing to sell
Incomplete, the feelings are there
What do you mean, why should i care?
No operator, no secrecy here
Five, four, three, two, one dimensional
I want to get what i feel i deserve
Not just the pleasure of your company
Not just a measure of the promises you made
And what's more
I don't believe a single word you say
Would it matter anyway?
Strayed for a moment, so let's make a deal
You keep to the valley, i'll keep to the hill
Too late for your shadow, one less thing to feel  incomplete, the feelings are there
What do you mean, why should i care?
No operator, no secrecy here
Five, four, three, two, one dimensional
Indiscreet, yet so self-aware
You play a part in everything i seem to fear
So what's the problem, is everything clear?
Five, four, three, two, you're one dimensional
