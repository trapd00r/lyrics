Boy I know you want me I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin' won't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and every time you need me you give me signs
But when I ask you what's the deal you hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me you gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love it's all here for you, oh yeah

When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you keep actin' this way you're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play you better hurry up
'Cause every time I come around crews run around your way
I see you on the corner but you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you baby you seem so shy
What's the problem baby never had a girl like I
I can see right through you and you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together 'cause you're running out of time

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Yo, close your eyes, shorty
You're guaranteed to be hypnotized
By the remix that Wyclef provides
I don't care 'bout your size girl shake your thighs
All I'm tryin' to do in the hood is stay alive
Make a little money with Destiny's Child
Thugs hear this song, they dance, they go wild
Like Texas, they movin' like no-limit soldiers
They went from a dream to the young supremes, sing it girl

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
