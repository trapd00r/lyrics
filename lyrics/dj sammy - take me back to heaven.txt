It's not my world - No love to find
It's not my world - Going down with time
It's cold, It's changed
Need the one to help me rearrange

It's not my world - where there's no peace
No sign of joy - It lives in me
I need to see a better day
If I just fly, I'll find my way

Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back to Heaven
Take me back...

Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back to Heaven
...Ah yeah...
I can fly
