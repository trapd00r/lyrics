At least I won't be shot for singing
I'm a free agent, I can "protest"!
This must be freedom, I must be happy
So let Mandela rot in prison
Someone should tell him how lucky he is
Read him George Orwell, explain about Naipaul
Because he must understand how he needs us
What with our culture, and our charm, and our brains
But how could he understand?
Heathen have no soul...
