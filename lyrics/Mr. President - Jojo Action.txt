JoJo c'est la vie (2x)

His name is JoJo
He's sexy talking - hip hip hip
And JoJo go-go
He's funky walking - tip tip tip
He's sweet as honey can be
A coconut tree
I feel lazy crazy

When JoJo's acting
Selecting he says - you you you
He takes you dancing
Romancing makes you
Blue blue blue
He's like a bird on a tree
A sweet harmony
I feel lazy crazy

Chorus:
JoJo Action - satisfaction
Candy apple tree
JoJo Action - satisfaction
JoJo honey bee
Listen JoJo Action
Gimme satisfaction
JoJo c'est la vie
Listen JoJo Action
Gimme me satisfaction
JoJo come with me

When JoJo' s smoking
He's joking kind of - tip tip tip
Gives you illusion
Confusion very - hip hip hip
He makes you fire and ice
And JoJo's so nice
I feel lazy crazy

Chorus

Rap:
Hey JoJo, you are down at the disco
Turn up your collar
And you're ready to go-go
Hip hip hip, let's do it
Tip tip tip, come on
You're the man
The center of attraction
That's why they call you JoJo Action
Hip hip hip, everybody, tip tip tip
Come on!

Chorus
