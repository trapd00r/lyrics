[Verse 1:]
I was raised, to believe what I see,
So I pray, to God, 
Give me strength, help me breathe, 
When they suck, life from me, 
Somethings wrong, Anything

[Chorus:]
Wrong with me, I don't see, 
Anything, wrong with me.

[Verse 2:]
So I write, and I pray, 
and I live, day to day, 
and I wait, for the sun, 
and I love, everyone, 
still they find, something wrong, anything

[Chorus:]
Wrong with me, I don't see, 
Anything, wrong with me. 

[Bridge:]
You can't hide what's inside what's inside
You can't hide what's inside what's inside
You can't hide what's inside what's inside
You can't hide what's inside when you die
You can't hide, what's inside
When you die, you will die. 
Break me, break me down. 
You can't hide what's inside when you die
You can't hide what's inside when you die
You can't hide what's inside when you die
You can't hide, What's inside

[Ending:]
When you die, who will die
You will die, You will die, You will die
