Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ...!
Ow!

If your body needs water, keep dancin'
'Cause you oughta keep the blood flowin' down 2 your feet
Brother Maurice'll be 'round in a minute
With a bucket filled in it - squirrel meat
The blood real good if you drink it real fast
But the aftertaste just lasts and lasts
So if you kiss somebody, U wanna party all night (All right!)

Superfunkycalifragisexy, oh! Ah! {x2}

See, if you do 2 much, your skin'll be sensitive 2 the touch
The first person that touch U, U wanna fuck
U take 'em 2 your crib and you tie 'em 2 a chair
And you make funny faces till they get real scared
Then you turn on the neon, then you play with yourself
Till you turn 'em on

Superfunkycalifragisexy, oh! Ah! {x2}

This beat is on time
Refined and designed 2 make you do the do
Superfunkycalifragisexy

This chair goes round and round
I feel like a clown 'cause I'm stripped down
It's all fun and games till the very next day
Till, damn, U don't remember my name
Maybe I'll see you next Thursday night
Maybe I won't, but that's all right
'Cause in my possession there's a signed confession that says
I was the best U'd ever had
2 bad (Ow!)

This beat is on time
Refined designed 2 make you do the do
Superfunkycalifragisexy, oh! Ah! {x2}

Baby, keep the blood flowin' down 2 your feet
Brother Maurice'll be 'round in a minute
