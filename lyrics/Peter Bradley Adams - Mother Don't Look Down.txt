There's no break from the sound of the siren's call
It will ring in your ears right to the dawn
Oh mother, oh mother don't look down
Cause your children, your children will soon be found

They were raised by your hands to love and fear
When they cried in the dark you held them near
Oh mother, oh mother don't be sad
Cause your children, your children will soon come back

You will hear them when they call across the sky
And find them forever in that sweet by and by

When it seems like the sky around you falls
And those faces you love you can't recall
Oh mother, oh mother don't you frown
Cause your children, your children are round you now

You will hear them when they call across the sky
And find them forever in that sweet by and by
And find them forever in the sweet by and by
