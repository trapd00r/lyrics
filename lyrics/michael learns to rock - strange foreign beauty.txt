Strange foreign beauty
I'll never know what's in your heart
Does anyone know how it feels to hold you?
Does anyone know the secret of your mind?

Strange foreign beauty
I'll never come to share your world
Does anyone know how it feels to live with you?
Does anyone know the secret of your life?

Strange foreign beauty
You'll never know what I felt for you
Sometimes it feels like a million chances
Are slipping away disappearing in the air

Strange foreign beauty
Strange foreign beauty

Never know what I felt for you
You were always on my mind
Never know how it feels to hold you
How it feels to be with you
