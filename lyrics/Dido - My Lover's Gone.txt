My lover's gone, 
His boots no longer by my door, 
He left at dawn, 
And as I slept I felt him go, 
Returns no more, 
I will not watch the ocean, 
My lover's gone,
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again,
Bring him home again.

My lover's gone, 
I know that kiss will be my last, 
No more his song, 
The tune upon his lips has passed 
I sing alone, 
While I watch the ocean, 
My lover's gone, 
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again, 
Bring him home again.
