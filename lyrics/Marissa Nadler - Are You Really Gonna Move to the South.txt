Slept with your shirt
Still hide your scent
Expected you to walk in with a key
Took the air out of my lungs for weeks
The memory of your mouth on me

Are you really gonna move?
Are you really gonna move to the south?
To the south?

In my car, I look to the right
Where you'd sit, just a beam of light
Sleepwalking through the days
I've been out of my mind
Chasing back the days
To where you and I collide

Are you really gonna move?
Are you really gonna move to the south?
To the south?

For a long time
I slept with my arms pointed west
For a long time
Straight to your chest

Are you really gonna move to the south?
Are you really gonna move to the south?
Are you really gonna move to the south?
Are you really gonna move to the south?
Are you really gonna move to the south?
Are you really gonna move to the south?
Are you really gonna move?
