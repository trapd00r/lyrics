Had your picture on my iPhone for a minute, yeah
It's a different time zone when I'm in it
I still miss you with my eyes closed when I did it, yeah
Good to be alive in the morning, yeah
Mean no harm, see no harm
You look fine in what you got on
IG pics don't do enough, you got it all
And don't ask where my head at, you know what I'm on

Might be a while 'fore I wife that, you ain't gotta ask where the pipe at
Ain't text no bitches, I ain't type that, no, no, no
