Einstein
Yeah, yeah.
Watch out.

Ain't no runnin' from
Karma and no runnin'
Ain't no runnin' from
Karma and no runnin'.

(Repeat)

Will.i.am
I'm the caboose of the wrong doings you produce
The wild tail of the tornado running loose
You tie the noose, I kick the chair
I'm the cinai that snatch your life while you gasp for air
The echo of the "Fuck you" that boomerangs to hurt your loved ones
The thief that held your son, held by ransom
The pervert that raped your wife
The hand that held the knife that took your life
You shot 2Pac and Biggie
Now I'm comin' after you like V W X Y Z
This is cause and effect, the dominal effect
The "What goes up, must come down" effect
You hopin' though, that you had a hand in doin' the doin'
The conclusion of the evil that you ended and start pursuin'.

Einstein
Ain't no runnin' from
Karma and no runnin'
Ain't no running from
Karma and no runnin'.

(Repeat)

Apl.de.ap
This is the payback from the past
You threw me down like I was just a piece of trash
You gave me cash every week just enough to live
But didn't get what I deserved instead I was deceived
Still young and didn't know about this in the street
Of the acts, so crass and shady
Don't crush your dreamshow and your whole entity
Subliminally your on the hire from a slavery
Remember that "What goes around, comes around"
God is watchin' you and everything that you do
Do you remember everything that you did before
The way the bad action opens cosmic door
I'm a leave it up to God what he got for you
I'm a leave it up to Him what he got for me
And he's watchin' you.

Einstein
Yeah, yeah
Watch out.

Ain't no runnin' from
Karma and no runnin'
Ain't no runnin' from
Karma and no runnin'.
