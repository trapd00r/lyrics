Hey!

Busty co-eds live live live
You'll crash the car, man, if you drive
1-800, 1-800, 1-800 wired
OBGYGYN
Triple xxx
Time that you and me
Had lots and lots of meaningless sex
Erotic city VIP
The pornorific girl in me
I came and now i faked it
He's still tied to the bed

Adorable, affordable
Guaranteed discretion
In the story of my life
You'll barely get a mention
I see Paris, I see France
I can see your underpants
Oh, I see Paris, I see France
Oh, I hear London calling

Now you've come so you can rip 'em off
Oh, baby, I know where you live

I'm overrated, desecrated
Still somehow illuminated
I know I've got a screw loose
Just meet me in the bedroom
I know you did this, what a punk
You would never sell out
Just like i did in playboy
That was all, it didn't count

Love the way your mouth fits mine
1-800, he's so fine
I'm infra-red, I'm in your head
I won't be leaving soon
I see Paris, I see France
Oh, I can see your underpants
Oh, I see Paris, I see France
Oh, I hear London calling

Now you've come, please, baby, rip 'em off
No, baby, I know where you live
No, and I can smell her on you everywhere
No, baby, I can not forget

And I'm coming for you!!

Hey gabbagabba baby
Hey gabbagabba baby
I know where you live
(Shut up!)
Hey gabbagabba baby
(Shut up!)
I know where you live
(Shut up! Shut up!)
I'm a little bit older than you
(Shut up!)
Yeah, than you
(Shut up! Shut up! Shut up...)
(heavy breathing)

You know how when your phone went dead?
Well, that was me on the other end
You know how when your phone went dead?
Oh, that was me on the other end
And when I touched your limousine
I really felt the vibe
It said I love you, babygirl, you know
'Cause I can read your mind

Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
And I'm comin', comin', comin' for you
Shut up!
I know where you live
(Shut up! Shut up!)
Hey gabbagabba baby
I know where you live
(Shut up! Shut up!)
Just a little bit older than you
(Yeah, than you)
I know where you live
