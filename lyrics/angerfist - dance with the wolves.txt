Weapons to blast
Boat names with cocaine dreams screaming "I own the game!"
I'm so stained Novacaine doesn't slow the pain

Blast!

Let it go (go go)

Cocaine!

Dance with the wolves, wrestle with the pitbulls
For fistfuls of dollars and cents, we empty pistols
Dance with the wolves, wrestle with the pitbulls
For fistfuls of dollars and cents, we empty pistols

We'll stick you for your shine
Hustle, nickle for a dime
Trouble, this you're gonna find
Muscle, if you wanna grind
Struggle, digits on the mind
Couple, figures for the crime
Scuffle, fists or with the nine
Bubble, living on the line (line line line)
