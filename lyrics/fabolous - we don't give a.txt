sick mothafuckers!
go head, throw up nigga
yea yea ok, i know you punks i know i know yeah yeah
[Verse 1]
even when i had smaller digits
The kid was never a playa hata or a baller bigot
Every week, pay em all a visit
I bring Pamela Lee to the P's so we all can dig it
I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it
Guns, stand them up they be as tall as midgets
O.k, I'll rap a little faster
But do I really sound like I turned from a rapper to a pastor
I'm like you except I date supermodels
The cars that I drive, the state troopers follow
We get the same parties probably
My stones look like sunshine, yours partly cloudy
And I dont front for nothin'
I likes, I gets, I dont want for nothin'
I'm givin' yall straight answers
And I'd rather be dead than livin wit a hate cancer

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say, talk if you wanna talk
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Look how you wanna look, grill if you wanna grill
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Act how you wanna act, front if you wanna front
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Live how you wanna live, try if you wanna die
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!

[Verse 2]
I used to just post on the corner, roast marijuana
I'd be on the coast of Tiajuana
Bitches who look, close to Madonna,
Dosie cabanna, toast by nana
Im 'sposed to be one of those dudes that ride in Testaroastas upon ya
Not to boast but I'm gonna, I keep toastin the armor
for niggaz who supposed to be drama
I mostly just wanna, get fed garlic toast and lasagna
Get head while I'll roast in a sawna
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, how can you hate that?
and i aint concerned with the scandals
Cause its all bullshit my attourneys can handle
Yall insides be burnin like candles
Rippin down posters, turnin' the channels
You gonna end up in an urn on a mantle nigga, yea

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I look at these brothers and laugh
Jealous niggas dont hate havin, just others who have
I still got love for the av.,
Come through to give ya niggas girls baby mothers my math
I speak on others behalf, only hate makin money
and gotta give the government half
You know this brother live last
And not even Mike seen Jordans in the colors I have
I used to run from undercovers like Shaft
That was until this young playa got shoved into the draft
Now I'm covered in ice, like Bruce Lee's bodies
Niggas is scared, to lose these hotties
Talk if you wanna talk, grill if you wanna grill
We dont give a fuck nigga
Front if you wanna front, try if you wanna die
If you live its luck nigga

[Chorus]
