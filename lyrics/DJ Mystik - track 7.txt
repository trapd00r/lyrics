You saved my soul
In the dark of the night
When i was lonely
Your body touched mine so gently
Stay
In the dark of the night
Cause your love only
Can make me feel safe forever

I was walking alone
On the desperate sands of the twilight islands
When my dreams of love
Seemed to die in the cool of the night
I was in danger of losing my soul
But then, your hand touched mine

Oh baby, you found me just in time
When the night must've fallen
Shadows of fear were on my mind
My heart was crying

You saved my soul
In the dark of the night
When i was lonely
Your body touched mine so gently
Stay
In the dark of the night
Cause your love only
Can make me feel safe forever

You lit a light in the dark
So I could find a way out
And your love
Send a guardian angel to help me
And make me feel sure
That i wasn't alone
And the twilight isn't silent anymore

Oh baby, you made my mind
I see
When I thought i was dying
Gone were the dreams
Your touching me
And i stopped crying

You saved my soul
In the dark of the night
When i was lonely
Your body touched mine so gently
Stay
In the dark of the night
Cause your love only
Can make me feel safe forever

You saved my soul ( x 8)
Stay (x 7)

You saved my soul
In the dark of the night
When i was lonely
Your body touched mine so gently
Stay
In the dark of the night
Cause your love only
Can make me feel safe forever
