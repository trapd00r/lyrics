I like the fact that you depend on me
In every possible way
When your eyes wander off desperately

That you never look straight
I enjoy when you hesitate
'Cause I don't mind to wait
Somehow it?s keeping me safe

All I want is you, all I need is you
Everything slips away
I won't lose you
No, you're gonna stay with me

I don't mind you taking after me
No thoughts of your own
Lost for words repeating constantly
No, no, I don't mind
In fact it calms me down

All I want is you, all I need is you
Everything slips away
The thought of us
Gets me through the day

All I want is you, all I need is you
Everything slips away
I won't lose you
No, you're gonna stay with me

I won't lose you
No, you're gonna stay with me
