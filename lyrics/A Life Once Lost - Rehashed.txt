My head never rests on my shoulders facing the sun
I struggle to walk
The burden of this guilt I hide from you is growing
You'll never know what it is
This is the kind of person that I am
This is the kind of person I've turned into
In time of song I am the kamikaze dreamer
Clog my own throat; swallowed by color-tortured slumber
Now flying high I am the kamikaze dreamer
Gouge out my eyes; swallowed by color-tortured slumber
It becomes harder to breathe or think clearly
Remorse instigates an overkill of self-loathing the older I get
So I'll rest my deadbeat tongue, you'll dismiss me anyway
