You don't know just
When to stop and when to go
City streets in the dead of winter
Stop your mind with dirty snow

Walk at night and
Touch your hand to the golden lights
And let them show
Feel the shadows disappearing
I'll smile and say
I told you so

Baby...
Tell me why, if you think you know why
People love when there's no tommorow
And still not cry when it's time to go
And still not cry when it's time to go
And still not cry when it's time to go?

The wall of your memory
Still echoes your sorrow;
The pictures of sadness
Are not what they seem
So hold out your smile, take
My hand and be happy;
These pictures of sadness
Are not all they seem

Are you so old that you've no childhood?
Is your timeline so unreal
That all your sunsets
Come in the morning?
Baby...tell me...how you feel?

Shelves of books in your mirror reflected
The sidewalks and alleys that you've seen
Show colours change as the images fade in
The magical vanishing memory machine

Baby...
Tell me how, if you think you know how
People love when there's no tommorow?
Do people love if there's no tommorow
And still not cry when they have to go
And still not cry when they have to go
And still not cry when they have to go?
