This love in my heart it will burn on forever
Granting me courage, I hope it will never stop
And no matter where you are, nothing is too far
With our everlasting bonds, we'll reach it
We are hope

I'm so truly grateful I ran into you on the day so long ago
We laughed every moment with tears in
Our eyes till we knew we weren't alone
The blowing wind came in and joined us on our way, ahh
And with it I know we'll rise
We'll be flying up high
Why? Tell me why are you giving up
Why? Tell me why you want to fight alone
Hey, what kind of future do you think you have?
Your dream is already in your hands
This love in my heart it will burn on forever
Granting me courage I hope it will never stop
And no matter where you are, nothing is too far
With our everlasting bonds, we'll reach it
We are hope

On the horizon out on the edge of the world
There is a place that I want to take you to
Let's head for it then
But as for the way, we already know
We promised it long ago

You scream but your voice it can't break through the silence
Feeling defeated, it crushes your helpless heart
I've got your back, I swear
I'll always be here
Let's put our fate within this light under the sun

Can you close your eyes
And just listen to my voice?
Let's find the answer together - I'm telling you
In our path, I trust that it will lead us
To another sea, uncharted, cause now
We are hope

On the horizon out on the edge of the world
There is a place that I want to take you to
Let's head for it then
But as for the way, we already know
We promised it long ago
