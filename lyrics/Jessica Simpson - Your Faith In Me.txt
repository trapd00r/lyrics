When I see you there
I'm so aware
Of how lucky I am, baby
'Cause I don't deserve
I don't come close
To understanding baby

The logic of your kind and trust
It amazes me
That someone like you
Would care enough
To just believe

Your faith in me
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
To hold onto
When I fall
When I'm weak
All the strength that I need
Is your faith, baby
Your faith in me

Even when I fall
I get along
'Cause our love is real, baby
It's like salvation to my soul
'Cause that's how it feels, baby

It's the sacred thing
That I keep close
To carry on
And I know that I will be all right
In your healing arms

(Your faith in me)
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
To hold onto
When I fall
When I'm weak
All the strength that I need
Is your faith, baby
Your faith in me

You make me feel I can walk on water
(I can reach above the stars)
And nothin' comes against me
Safe within your arms-

(Your faith in me
It pulls me through
When there's nothing around
To hold onto)
When I fall, baby
(When I'm weak
All the strength that I need)
Is your faith, baby
Your faith in me

When I fall, baby
When I'm weak, baby
All I need, baby
Is your faith in me...

Your faith in me
