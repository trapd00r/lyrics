Maya you could be the lucky one
Maya I hope you'll find another man
She lived in an bliss
In a cage of rust
Forever he would be hers
Sealed by a diamond ring

Michael left a cold shoulder goodbye
What could she do but stare at the white walls
Paper thin in weeks
'Cause in city of hope
You're never as high
As before you get crushed

No more lies, lies, lies
No more lies

From now on everything's gonna change
I won't be let down
Time's a slippery slope she said
Only a waste to wait
I'll take what's mine, mine, mine, mine
I'll take what's mine

Maya left the city for the great sea
Out west she can be who she needs to be
With a view of the deep blue
Life close to the beach
And the promise of something
To get washed up from the sea

From now on everything's gonna change
I won't be let down
Time's a slippery slope she said
Only a waste to wait
Mine, mine, mine, mine
Only a waste to wait

From now on everything's gonna change
Only a waste to wait
Only a waste to wait
Mine, mine, mine, mine
