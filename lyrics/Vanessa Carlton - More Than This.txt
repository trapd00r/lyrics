Cradling stones, hot fire bright 
As crickets call out to the moonlight 
And as you lean in to steal a kiss 
I'll never need more than this 

We all share the pain of our histories 
But the ache goes away if you could see 
This night under stars, well I call it peace 
If you say I'll never need more than this 

And the trees grow so thick you can barely see through 
And the forest bestows all the simplest of truths 
And you think you'll be happy if granted one more wish 
But the truth is 
You'll never need more 
You'll never need more 
You'll never need more than this 

Want so much in this life, there's so much to be 
We sail through our youth so impatiently 
Until we see 
That the years move along and soldiers and heroes come home 
And they carry a song 

Don't live in forgotten times 
May this always remind 
You of the sea under the skies 
Blue looking glass
Let's make this our story 
Let's live in the glory 
Time it fades away precious as a song 
'Cause someday we'll be gone 

Cradling stones hold fire bright 
As we watch the glow of the morning light 
Someday our bones here they will lie 
And so we sing 

As the years move along and soldiers and heroes come home 
And they carry a song...

Let's make this our story 
Let's live in the glory 
Time it fades away precious as a song 
'Cause someday we'll be gone
