Tall as houses
Small as spiders
Undefined this buzz inside us

Tightrope walker
Chaos order
I fell right into heaven/hell
Devil take me
God forsake me
Made my home in heaven/hell

Out of ruins growing pains
Wide-eyed pirates crossing bones

Tightrope walker
Chaos order
I fell right into heaven/hell
Devil take me
God forsake me
Made my home in heaven/hell

Kicking giants drowned in reason
Breaking old building new

Tightrope walker
Chaos order
I fell right into heaven/hell
Devil take me
God forsake me
Made my home in heaven/hell
