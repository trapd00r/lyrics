Go, go, go

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you

He'll have to go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go

Whisper to me, tell me, do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Though love is blind, make up your mind I have got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him

He'll have to go
Go, go, go

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you want me, answer yes or no
Darlin' I will understand

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Let's pretend we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you

He'll have to go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
