What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough
If you will, to be saved not in a religious sense, 
but not to constitute what this country, at times, calls "we throw away children"
We seem to be approaching an age of the gross (burp)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station
And each generation should do a little bit better

Alright come on let's cut this bullshittin' and dub
Let's get it started let's start addressin' this issue
And open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And this whole origina
The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
The music that you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was boy on the East side of Detroit
Crossin' 8 Mile and a war and they hit territory
I'd like to share a story this is my story
And can't nobody tell it for me
I am well aware that I don't belong here
You made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn they're everywhere
From bel air shoppin' centre just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side
A day that I might slide
You may call it a pass I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up theyd' give me a lift up
8 Mile and van dyke I'd steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her momma's and charmer's
After dark to sneak me in the house
When I'm kicked out my mum's
That's about the time I first met Proof
Wed goof hed carry on the steps said I was bored handin' out some flyers
He was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check this out some time
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And they both had the same rhymes that soundalike
We was on that same shit
That big daddy kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade 
Can't forget that day in school 
It was cool til' your man
MC Sham came through
And said that Puma's the brand
cause the Klan makes Troops.
It was rumors but man, goddamn they flew
Must'a been true because man we done banned they shoes,
I had the new ones, the cool J, Ice-lambs, suede too.
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they was yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X-clan debuted.

With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter, we would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
We was being laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is...
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe
