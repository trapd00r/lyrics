I can see a purple moon behind the maple trees 
And I'm feeling so alone - I'm lost in fantasies 
You just hold my hand 
But I want so much more of you 
Oh I wanna taste your lips to prove your love is true 

Why you're so shy 
Won't I do any harm 
If I am falling into your arms 
I'll make you feel fine 
Why you're so shy 
Just tame me if you can 

If your love is strong we will get along 
Together tonight 
Why you're so shy 
Why you're so shy 

I believe you are a man who'll make me feel so high 
I believe those wildest dreams of mine 
You'll satisfy 
Love is more than holding hands 
It's total ecstasy 
If you'll give me all your love 
I'll make you feel so free
