in a forest pitch dark
glowed the tiniest spark
it burst into a flame
like me
like me

my name Isobel
married to myself
my love Isobel
living by herself

in a heart full of dust
lives a creature called lust
it surprises and scares
like me
like me

my name Isobel
married to myself
my love Isobel
living by herself

when she does it she means to
moth delivers her message
unexplained on your collar
crawling in silence
a simple excuse

nana na nana
nana na nana

in a tower of steel
nature forges a deal
to raise wonderful hell
like me
like me

my name Isobel
married to myself
my love Isobel
living by herself

when she does it she means to
moth delivers her message
unexplained on your collar
crawling in silence
a simple excuse

nana na nana
nana na nana
nana na nana
nana na nana
