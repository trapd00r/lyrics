To think I'm so naive.. how dare you play with me
I gave you heart and soul yeah
Tell me baby please
Oh why you screwin with my head
I don't think you understand
I won't take your.. uhh.. no more
Don't knock on my door

Not this time.. because I realize
I've heard it all before... and I.... I.. I

I think of all the time that I've waisted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it  (face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

Don't tell me how to feel
Or say that you're for real
My minds made up I'm cool without ya
You got no more appeal
Now this girl don't need no man
Say what you can do what she can't
Now I live for me
Boy does that make you weak

Not this time...because I realize
I've heard it all before... and I.... I.. I

I think of all the time that I've waisted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it(face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

Think of times you made me cry you
had me so confused
I'm tired of trying
leave behind this
What's a girl to do

Think of all the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldn't handle it
What you think, I'm just another chick
Mess with Brit, boy you must have tripped
What were you thinkin' when you lost my trust
You had it all and now your left with nothing
Ooh baby now I know you want my touch
and now you're lonely and you still want me

I think of all the time that I've wasted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it(face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in

I think of all the time that I've wasted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Ain't no way I'll be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
Let's just face it (face it)
Better off alone and I won't turn back
You thought that I would be lonely
I don't wanna let you back in
