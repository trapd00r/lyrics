Over and over
You see yourself treading the same old path
Destroy the recall
Wonder and wonder
If there's a way to start all over
Fate
And endless whirl of possibilities
Silent sky drowned in blood

Take it in your hands
Take it
Shattered box find your sky

Open your mind now
Pandora's box the truth you disavow
Fate
Weaving new lines on the hands of fate
What do you pray for? Beyond the time

Take it in your hands
Your choice shapes the future
(You can hear and feel this futuristic sound)
Universe expands
Unlocked
(Wake up open your mind)
(Wake up open your mind right now)

Bright light or darkness
Salvation or doom is all in your hands
Fate
I gaze beyond the cave, I'm blind no more
What do you pray for? Beyond the time

Take it in your hands
Your choice shapes the future
(You can hear and feel this futuristic sound)
Universe expands
Unlocked
(Wake up open your mind)
(Wake up open your mind right now)
