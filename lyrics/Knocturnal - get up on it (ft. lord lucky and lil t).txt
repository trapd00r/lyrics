Well, I'm walking down Virginia Avenue
I'm trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to.
Harold's club is closing, everybody's going on home
What's a poor sailor to do?

I guess I'll get on back into my short, make it back to the fort
Sleepin off all the crazy lizards inside of my brain.
got to be some place that's better than this
This life I'm leading's driving me insane

And I'm dreaming...

And I'm dreaming to the twilight, this town has got me down.
I've seen all the highlights, I've been walking all around
I won't make a fuss, I'll take a Greyhound bus, carry me away from here
Now what have I got to lose?

'Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue
The bars are all closing, 'cause it's quarter a' two
Every town I go to is like a lock without a key
Those I leave behind are catching up on me,
catching up on me, they're catching up on me
Catching up on me, catching up on me, catching up on me.
