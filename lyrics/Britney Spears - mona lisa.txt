This is the story about... Mona Lisa

By Mona Lisa

Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a little story to tell
About Mona Lisa, And how she suddenly fell (huh)
See everyone knew her, They knew her oh so well
Now I am taking over to release her from her spell

She's the original, she's unforgettable,
She wants you to know, she's been cloned
It's kind of incredible
She's so unpredictable
She wants you to know she's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

She was taken under, drowning in her sea (huh)
Running like an angel, she was crying but could not see (oh no!)
Now see everyoneâ€™s watching, as she starts to fall
They want her to breakdown
Be a legend of her fall

She's the original, she's unforgettable,
She wants you to know, she's been cloned
It's kind of incredible
She's so unpredictable
She wants you to know
She's been cloned, she's been cloned, she's been cloned

Ladies does that make you cry? (huh)
Mona Lisa's got to fly
Nobody really dies
Everyone, may we have a moment of silence? Right here. (huh)

Good

She's the original, she's unforgettable,
She wants you to know, she's been cloned
It's kind of incredible
She's so unpredictable
She wants you to know that she's home, that she's home

She's the original, she's unforgettable
She wants you to know, she's been cloned
It's kind of incredible
She's so unpredictable
She wants you to know, that she's home, that she's home, that she's home
