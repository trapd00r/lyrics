[Verse 1: Eminem]
C'mon y’all look there's six of us
Y'all right now are in the midst of
In the mix with us
With Tim Westwood
Y’all can't step to us
Y'all just should
Shut your damn mouth, I cannot cuss so damn
Is the worst word that I can say outta my mouth

So when I do this fool this rhyme is fluid
Spittin' like ammunition when I go to it
I hop to it
It ain't hip hop is it?
Yes it is y'all need to pay us a visit
We're D12 reason it ain't just D6
Cause when we stomp you it feels like 12 of us knee clicks

Ah and it goes like that
Everybody know y’all give us the mic’ back

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
G shit respectic
I'll fuck a bitch that’s pregnant and anorexic
Check it
I'm up to no good
You laughin'
I'm fresh Tim Wood-Wood
Please don’t fucking cuss
Motherfucker suck my dick
Don't talk shit
Yo I'm fuckin' up
So I'ma pass the mic' to my nigga Proof
Blast off

[Verse 3: Swifty]
I'm drivin' 75/mph
Sippin' I'm a [?] sour
Bumpin' money in the power
I'm on my way to send my enemies some flowers
With a sarcastic face
I murdered the coward
Tryna stop my hustle
You get devoured
You get covered with mo' shells and mussels layin' awkward
I bust you
With your family layin' in Boxford
I pack something special to keep the cops hurt
The word is covered with it so you can't stop dirt
I'm snatchin' it
Don't let the others get it
That won't work
I smoke
Don't let you hit it when it's burnt
'Cause [?] rap my lyric
You besta stay alert
You besta stay alert

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ay yo, listen
I will come at you for mines
Run at you with nines
Coat snatcher for dimes
I'm the punisher of rhymes
Call us ginsu
Any bit you get cut through
You put the fan in fantast[ic]
I put the f in [fuck you]

1/6th a partner D12 is darker
With hearts I hate as pure as Author
Cerebral is sharper
All six sense keen as Peter Parker
This is the area 9 sparker

Race through a stage like a wild boar
My style of war
Even worse than Bizarre snore
Punch the oaked arch the land when I march
I'm a shark that makes battlin' into an art
I'm true with a pen, my category a few would be in
Don't matter if you anglo, mulatto or nubian

Make the strong fall
Ride on a long haul
Beat up my last girl 'cause she sucked the wrong ball
All y'all MCs whether friend or foe
Playin' it low, I'm plannin' to blow ya leg with mo'
With thoughts that make due I penetrate through
You got dreams of beatin' me your alarm clock'll wake you
Hate you, erase your face and disgrace you
Spray your filet, and then just lace you doe
My style is ratchet with the sin
Most of y'all like homos. Why?
Cause y'all gon' catch it in the end

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
I'm a nightmare devious
With the most mischievous crew in the industry
Without an ounce of lenience
The disobedient
Gun grabbin'
Get stashed
End in the back of a paddy wagon
Braggin' about a stabbin'
You dumb rappers get blasted
Buried alive
Under 30 feet of snow
In the xmas with no casket
I'm that man
Who love CAT scans
A fat chance you'll be seen alive
After bein' thrown in a black van
Assassin masked man
Gettin' a lap dance
From crack heads
On trash cans
With my last hand
Passin' in
I blast women
Ran past grinnin'
When the mac's spinnin'
I suffer from bad livin'

[Verse 6: Mr. Porter]
That's right I'm back y'all
The incredible
Hacksaw
Jim Duggan
Still thuggin'
With the same 4-by-4 thing
Will press against your mama
Coochie while we huggin'
You ain't got problems
You just act crazy
Try havin' 8 babies
By 12 different ladies
It don't add up
Do it?
I keep sayin' I'm the daddy
But them chickens won't own up to it
Run right through it
That's it

[Verse 7: Bizarre]
Bamm
Guess who just crushed your party
I'm Devo punk
What you got on my 40
It's Detroit's finest
Million niggas spineless
I'm too f-in' dope
You better rewind this
Did two pints of Bacardi
Comin' to your party
Blastin' everybody
I'm watching this prostitute
I said you wanna get down
She gave me a frown and said
54 pounds
Money
I'm blastin' niggas if they dummie
Am I a Tim Romney
When I pass the mic' Eminem

[Swifty]
When I'm runnin'  the script it change directions
Oh Eminem was grabbin' it
So I'ma let him flow

[Verse 8: Eminem]
Yo
I'll prolly stir up so much shit in Europe
I say a bad word and mess the whole tour up
Y'all don't wanna mess with me
It ain't ya destiny like child
I'm never wild when I'm riled up off runnin' like a mile
You runnin' to me?
I'ma punish you
If you ever gun at me
Any MC, who tries to step to this
I'm like the exorcist
Yo watch my neck just twist
Back and forth
When I smack you across
Your face if you try to say anything this way
Yo, but I got down with Dr. Dre
Now I'm rich bitch, I live a block away
From him, y'all can't say nothin', y'all can't say ish
Ish backwards is shi suck my
Yea y'all don't wanna' say it when I display it
When I kick this rhyme every time and convey it

[Verse 9: Swifty]
There's no escapin'
They headed for the last stage man
They like some ants lookin' up to some brothers with a [?]
Finna get sprayed
Frontin' me it's like grenade pins
Gettin' pulled
If you talk bull
Your day's in
I'm blazin'
I'm always in the mood to kill
7 million ways
Mac-11 pillin' the grill
How did occasion
What you facein' is stricktly real
I got hostages right now
No [?]
Everything that I own is just concealed
Even my cell phone
Would you use it
It'll slit your ear
I'm the worst here
This message
I must  get clear
When I'm up in here
Everything is busted clear

And that's fo' sho'

[Verse 10: Proof]
Any mic' I baby sit it
I stay the illest
I play with phyllis
Send you to Marvin Gay gun ville-is
Kill what I can
On dry land
A minute of my hand
Will kill an innocent bystand
No ER
You need CPR
After watchin' the VCR
Of me sittin' there beatin' your ma'
Fuck sex, I'm a Tec shooter
Mind full of crime just like Lex Luther
A poisonous trooper
Kill your baby mama friend
So your son won't have any boys inside his future
Fuck Paul Moody for tryna diss Em
So I'ma diss him
And that fool that kissed Kim
Just in!
Important News Flash
Girls can't keep their tongues off Proof's ass
I'm too fast
With the crazy methods
But what you gonna shit on you
Oh no that's Shady Records

Here it is when I flow back
And bust back some contracts
Freestyle off that, the battleaxe
I splash your vision like cataracts
Yo I snatch a MAC out his Cadillac
Now your whole team is tryna battle back
Or do a battle rap
We into none of that rude boy
Don Dada
I snatch a wrap and doesn't make peanut butter
See what utter
Style we impose
Y'all hoes can't flow
And that's the way it go P-R to the O
And that spells pro
Add an O to the F
Pro-of fuckin' your ho, oops
Did I cuss?

[Verse 11: Kuniva]
I'll throw your body in the back of a vet
Hit your brother in the back with a Tec
Count blood drippin' out the back of his neck
Kuniva is never lackin' respect
I sneak a gat on a jet
Jack the pilot the passengers next
Practice non violence
But I ain't perfected it yet
Plus you ain't dealt with no derelict shat
And it can happen' to you quick as you can think
As quick as the water rush out of a sink homie
Quick as you can blink
Imagine if I digested a couple of drinks
I'll probably black out
Send a couple of shots through your mink
I'm like the black Mr. Link
Certified psychotic without a shrink
Locked in a pan[try] with ink
Your definition of hard
Is shootin' at a car
While mine is 1-on-1
Without a bodyguard
I don't like you
In a matter of seconds
I can strike you
I hate you when mac taking three packs and spice 2s

[Verse 12: Bizarre]
What's your name
Yo no robes and press plaque
Put through your back once Bizarre overreact
Bitches and hoes I'm stinkin'
I give you a two piece
Like Kentucky Fried Chicken

[Verse 13: Kon Artist]
Yo
I was born with these devilish ways
Manic depressin' with punk ways
And syphilis aids from humpin' babes
Inside of caves, I got it made?
Stop lyin' to me chick
You just wanna get laid

I been wildin' out
Since the fifth grade
I been had a fetish
For switchblades, huh?
Look what the hell Detroit done conceived
A man with more schemes
Than the teeth in the mouth of Mateen Cleaves

Best believe we did it
D-1-2 counts and your out
Without
Detroit rock city, shifty, gritty
Temp me or piss me
And I lift these ten feet
High enough to start a riot up
Without Friar Tuck
I'm wired up
Yup yup, ask Teddy
The law run when they see me
Lickin' my machete

[Verse 14: Proof]
Alot of MCs be scared of Duvall
Like they got a house, a wife, two kids and a dog
So ask your self
Who stay folding the bank?
Who stay in handcuffs
And stay in the holdin' tanks?
Who stay in the beefs?
Who stay in the streets?
And he go to strip clubs
Just to play with his meat
Yo it's Big Proof y'all
Ain't nothin' fabricated
Your whole image to me
Is over-exaggerated

Who call us the Dick 12
When I spit shells
They stop, duck and roll
Just to try to get shells
That's how I feel, you plastic
I light up a mag clip
Faster your ma' light up a glass dick
And that's it
My team consist of crackers and blacks
That looks like the green packers with straps an'
You get smacked with gats
Backwards when I attack nerds
Who use these words before I know that
Flow that, catch pictures without that Kodak
Slow that, roll down homeboy you beefin'?
You got what reason?
When I turn into DH the Derty Harry
A nigga make your ass become late
As in living and breathing...
Who's jumpin' in so I can stop doing this freestyle receiving?
Somebody save em-

[Verse 15: Eminem]
I swear I'm leavin' you in the receiving room
With two tubes your breathing through
Y'all don't wanna stop this
It ain't even true
If you try to F with us
Then we're leavin' you
In a, mother f-in'
Is what I wanna say so bad
But I can't so I'm steppin'
To this mic' with
Something that I recite
That's a little bit clean
But fuck it I'm mean
When I kick this shit like a guillotine
I kick a iller scene
I'm bound to kill a teen
Slim Shady in your illest dreams
Your kids worst nightmare
Hold it right there
Hold the beat yea
Right there, the snare, and the drum kick
Y'all are dumb sick
Y'all need to get off my
Diiiiiuuchhk

[Verse 16: Swifty]
Dang
They temp me like Tim and Smith
Witness this
As you get cracked with this fifth
An alcoholic
Drowning rappers inside a toilet
'Cause I'm venomous
Gaugin' how you somersaultin'
I slap you for talkin'
You caught with lies
For that
I'ma have your mother walkin' on her thighs
I stalk in day time
That's with no disguise
I do walk bys
Drag 'em out in chalk gauze
And my hand is where your heart lies

[Verse 17: Bizarre]
Throw you second's what you ask in prisons
It's the bomb
I told you wasn't I bullshittin'
It's a-- test
I come to your [?] hot boys and man who fresh
Now who's the freshest point him out
I eat him like a Ex Lax
Then shit him out
Take a ecstasy mixed with hay and tanqueray
I'm blow 'em a record deal
Then windy day

[Verse 18: Kuniva]
I'm swervin' of lust
Servin' the cops on the murderous plot
Kill your moms and put her in a box
These bullets are strong as a ox
I'm sly as a fox
Creep up on you
In your drop top
While you feelin' [?]
I jack you for your suburban [?]
Urgin' to cock this gauge
That'll leave you disfigured
Like surgeons on pot
Kill you like I'm killin' this beat
Before your funeral arrangements are complete
I'm released back on the streets
When people are actin' up
I tell Derty Harry to back me up
And blow your mouth back like that be tha
It's kinda ballistic
Derelict
With the intelligence of a religious devoted terrorist
To make you history
Like gold medalist
And it's evident that I can blow your legs off
And leave you with one foot to pedal with

[Verse 19: Proof]
As time permits
And I'm the shit
With a rhyme to spit
If you dope
Then give me a line to sniff

Here
In hell
Yea that's probably where I see you again
Where Proof in hell

[Eminem]
With 10 males

[Verse 20: Proof]
A lawless figure
From that same clinic
A flawless killer
Bump a rap gang gimmick
So many back 'n' come with the same sentence
An' in the same sentence they bid it for that fame in it
The fact is
I'm doper than packages
That jump the borders
I hate you and dumb reporters
Yo Proof your raps don't benefit drugs do it
Shut up while I'm tryna butt fuck Jennifer Love Hewitt
A lot of you talk shit

[Eminem]
Buttplug

[Verse 21: Swifty]
I can put my hands on you from anywhere in the world
Rob your crib while you hidin' under the bed with your girl
Swiss cheese your mattress and I birl
I get scantless
Across this atlas
Nuttin' up like squirrels
An alcoholic
Like I said before
I'm the type of brother that the 5 will ignore
When they see me on the streets
On the 3-1-3
That's Detroit, Amityville
I'm Swifty passin' it
What?

[Verse 22: Eminem]
Pass it
I'm high off acid
Plus I'm plastered
I'm a bastard who jumped and lay [?]
With no clothes on butt naked
And asked for acid
I already said acid
I said it twice
But your head is full of lice
I tried to pull a heist
With a refrigerator full of mice
And full of ice
Yoo I'm so nice that
I'ma be polite to you
Yo you don't like this mic' do you
Good then let me take it back
When I rock this mic' then I do a naked rap
That means I rap naked
Yo you half bacon or half baked
A damn saint
Oh for God's sake
You don't want me to throw your whole squad in a lake
'Cause when I rhyme and roam this trip with bones to pick
Any MC who wants to grab this microphone and rip
It
Will get shit
Sh-it Sh-it
It's o-on
Yea
'Cause when I rock like that
Any MC who kicks hip hop like that
They get smacked with the back of the hand
While I pull up in a black van
Take all your mans and
Duct tape 'em
'uck rapin'
Fuck rapin'
Yea
Forget it I said it
Anybody in this bitch get beheaded and shredded
Like rice or lice
Whatever you wanna do
I take this mic' device
Strike it twice
I'm twice as nice as
Anybody in your crew when I
Do whatever I do I want to
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I'm drunk
And I
Beat a punk dude up
Throw him he get chewed up
And then spit it out
Shit it out
Like D12 'cause we'll poop on you
Yo anybody in your group on you
Yea
I don't really care
I ain't familiar
And if you wanna wave
And that really
Whatever

[Proof]
This is how we have fun

[Verse 23: Bizarre]
Christina sucks and Brittney swallows
Bizarre did too much on a bottle
You think I'm a joke
'Cause I smoke
I might sign a Capitol to Interscope
Too much dope
That I take
MCs'll get baked
Sayin' Bizarre kid is fake
What
People in France
Are musty
Step to me
I will [?]
In the mouth
Boy you know what I'm all about

[Verse 24: Eminem]
Going through customs
I might fruck around and bust them
I said fruck
I put a R
In between the F and the UK
I'm in the UK
And I will do get out with any MC or a DJ
Who don't play the right beat
Make you mincemeat
Over a Prince beat
Or a damn snare
I don't care you clap your hands bitch
I'll smack you there
Gotta shut the hell up and sit down
Because my skills are developed
And my whole skeleton
Exoskeleton
I'm coming from under

I can't be serious over this beat

[Verse 25: Proof]
Stinkin' ass Bizarre

Bamm guess who crushed the party
It's Devo punk what you got on my 40

[Verse 26: Kuniva]
Detroit's finest
Million niggas spineless
I'm too f-in' dope
You better rewind this

[Verse 27: Bizarre]
Did too much the way it counted
Smell like cigarettes, dog shit and old brownies
I strands then police is after me
I boost like a car battery
I aim for your heart
I'm broke as fuck I shop at Kmart
Why you laughin' Tim Westwood
I'm comin' to your hood
Breakin' in your house (Oh God)
Smackin' your spouse (Oh my God)
Eatin' your grandmother-- ohh

[Proof]
Aight Aight Aight
Ayo yo
Let's just
Let's do some drillin'

[Verse 28: Kuniva]
I'm so f-in' crazy
I killed my own

[D12]
MAMA

[Kuniva]
Ate her fat ass up
Like I was Jeffrey

[D12]
DAHMER
I'M A

[Kuniva]
Wild type of brother
With a

[D12]
HUMMER
HOURHHGGH

[Verse 29: Eminem]
What rhymes with hourhhggh (Poor)
I don't know let me think
Poor
Wait a minute let me take a drink
I take a little sip of Bacardi and Mountain Dew
And then I'll start to fuck up anybody out that's new
Oops I said F
The F word
Yo I'm a F-er
I'm phatter than a heffer
The grandmother I left her
Butt naked right in the middle of 7 Mile
Yo my style'll make the reverend smile

With my blouse
Undo my blouse
And ran through my house

I'm serious and delirious
When I'm-

[Verse 30: Bizarre]
Nigga step up
I put them on the motherfuckin' hospital gate
I'm smokin' on the gate
Smokin' weed everyday
With someone I say

[Verse 31: Proof]
My AK'll blast 'em
When I get 'em I'ma hit 'em

[D12]
HIT 'EM

[Verse 32: Proof]
And watch me split 'em
Word up D back in the crib
With my kids
And to the beat

[Verse 33: Kuniva]
Ayo that's how I--
How I eat barbecue ribs
I barbecue because I'm hard (HARD)
Dropped out the boulevard pull your call card (CARD)
I don't play when it comes to rhymes
'Cause when it comes to rhyme like I'm down from Earth

[Verse 34: Proof]
Tell 'em story
Go 'bout the days of glory
When we was hard on a boulevard
Everybody knew it

[Kuniva]
Yo we was young and stupid

[Verse 35: Bizarre]
I grew up
It was though
It was what
I had to huff an' puff
With my acrylic palette

[Verse 36: Proof]
Puff huff
Got my palette
Pale jacket
See this gun
I pack it
Yea

[Verse 37: Kuniva]
And we rob banks too
And we're quick to shank you
Take your money and say
Thank you

[Proof]
Thank you

[D12]
THANK YOU

[Verse 38: Eminem]
I spank you
I spank you with this gun the butt of it
Yo ain't want none of this
You don't want none of this punishment
I got a ton of shit

[Verse 39: Kuniva]
Yo
Throw your hands up and shut your mouth (Yeah)
I live in Detroit but got a crib down South

[Verse 40: Proof]
Stop cookin' with grease
Stop cookin' with grease
Stop cookin' with grease
And put potatoes in a big bag

Stop cookin' with grease
Stop cookin' with grease
Stop cookin' with grease
And put the fryers in a big bag

[Verse 41: Swifty]
All these potatoes
I made you
I made you
I made you
Look at all these potatoes
I made you

[Verse 42: Proof]
Aye
This is called
How you wild out
I lot of people tryna peep my style out
What's up to my people
I don't bail out
OK OK we can't take it no more
I rap if you can sell rap and when us all clap
Expose whack rappers
Then I smack 'em with my ball sack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Shorten your whole
Life like a DJ Head interlude
Punch my fist through
The ponchos of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood
Make a serious winner lose
Sippin' gin an' booze
Mixed with opioids and perm
To opium and sherm
And a fallopian of sperm
Hopin' people learn
No more jokin' with me
Denaun why don't you say something over the beat

Bump back we jump [?]
Jump with the track
Meet every morning
They girlies want to act
Why do the girlies dunked the brother in the truck
Why do the girlies dropped the brother in the truck
I say me girl and since it's on me
And we tryna let the song for the whole party
Be back my boy
They throws 'em up in the place
Put up your gun and just shoot up the place

So I turn to the one handed juggler and ask him
Why isn't [?] steppin' to a octupus

I know a guy named Marc LaBelle
That sparks the L
Climbed up a garage and fell
In The Garbage Pail
Ayo
Em your nuts are large as hell
Would you put 'em up?

[Verse 43: Eminem]
Well thank you
I was in the garage and fell
Until I saw Marc LaBelle
And sparked a L
And fell in a Garbage Pail

[Verse 44: Bizarre]
Ah, ah, ah
M.O.P
Paul's favortie crew
Yeaaah
I roll with a gang
That sport platinum chains
Tearin' niggas out the frame
Who the fuck wanna-
Me and Kuniva drunk drivin'
Pissin' on hydrant
Swallowin' whole bottles of [?]
Bitch suck my cock while I'm peein'
I did it all with a Jamaican, Chaldean, Korean
Bizarre (or European) through the life taker
Rush you with a ice breaker
Break your kid's back
They call me the back breaker
You don't want it
Especially when I'm blunted
'Cause you get stepped on like Keith for seventeen hundred
I stay cold like Steve Austin
'Cause D12 got problems
Like cars from the auction
Drunk drivin' passin' to Kuniva
So he can rip the mic'
I F a dyke

[Verse 45: Eminem]
Yea
Everybody in this bitch remains all gay
While I sit and blow up my brains all day
With the chainsaw chain keeps spinnin'
The motor keeps runnin'
The engine keep revvin'
So I go to sleep hummin'
Some people never notice me comin'
Like I was jackin' off while you were sleepin'

[Verse 46: Proof]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Form a [?] keep you warm a lot
Know what I'm sayin' with the mouth that I perform to God
Where they came to a home with some warm ass cock
[?] in the streets
[?]
[?]
[?]
If you ain't smokin' weed

[Verse 47: Eminem]
Then you ain't down with me
And you ain't down with P
Paul Rosenberg and we

[Verse 48: Kuniva]
It's understood that it ain't all good
These rappers couldn't hang with me
If they came from Rosewood
That's where the cops come
Rappers get pistol whipped with shotguns
'Till the handles broken
Or 'till the barrel's smokin'
You rap challengers
Get pushed off banisters
Unavoidable like anvil's
Droppin' on toon characters
I ain't feelin' ya
So why you actin' like a cinema
Messed around and got in some shit
Like enema
Spillin' ya cap
Endin' ya rap
Killin' ya back
Like crash collisions
A bad decision to react
I be the homegrown black
Hooded up, devious
Rough rap constructor
Unpredictable genius
Cowardly lyin' ass rappers
Get left spleenless
State of mind is demonic
And I'm still fiendin'
I'm mixed in from hellfire
So you can't extinguish
Pluckin' all you crab MCs
Up off my penis

[Verse 49: Swifty McVay]
They don't wanna beef
I love scuffles
I won't hesitate to sock you again
With swollen knuckles
My 380's penetrate
You hoes buckle
You done crossed my line
Like interstate so..
I do what you can't do
Rappers get trampled
When I'm strapped like bamboo
You get clear like samples
I'm wreckin' it
From Detroit to Netherlands
See it's evident
All you rappers would never win
You need to get a fat ass book for self defense
See your health's at risk
You get smoked like cigarettes
Keep it cool bro
You wouldn't like it when I'm upset
Scratchin' your nose can be a threat
It's true dog
I wipe you out the blue with a nine milly
Slappin' you silly
Leave rappers flatter than lily
Pads and it's really
Sad how they kill me
Thinkin' that they fresh, but ha!
I'm not feeling

[Verse 50: Mr. Porter]
Plans, power movements
I'm on some rude shh
I'm gittin' Prodigy
For his SP
Slap him and tell him that Keith Murray sent me
Since he's locked down
I'ma shoot 'till the Glocks empty
Invite Lil' Kim to my record release party
And Foxy Brown too
Just to get beef started
Cold hearted, come to your show and bogart it
Blast guns blindfolded and tell cops I'm retarded
Went to the lyricist lounge
And seen Cage
Poured my piss down his throat
Then told him I had AIDS
Master P asked me to do a song with him
As long as Super Shock ain't rappin', nigga I'm with it
Told my Runyon Ave niggas I'd make 'em proud
By butt fuckin' every ho in Destiny's Child yea
Seen Toto at a mobile
Told Puffy it was over
'Cause Faye signed to my label for a Range Rover
My brain's sober
But I still can't think
'Cause I keep seein' Kelly Price in a black bikini
Or something like that it was a topless thing
I told her get naked let me fuck her while she's singin'

Yo, yo ,yo
Full of 'em already and hocked to your block
With a brief and a dynamite blast
Now you to pass it
Your girl be sharin' the ass with niggas I roll with
The girl pick up clues quicker than Theraflu does colds bitch
We on some low shit holdin' my-
And your mama for ransom money to pay our rent with
See y'all punks just sick
Sicker than sick walk up in hits
Hands in their mouth and not acclaimin' a tricks
That ain't even it
It's gettin' me mad
I'll pop any fags for--

[Verse 51: Bizarre]
You can tell when D12 just had a session
Blood, empty brew bottles and automatic weapons
Bring your boys
Fuck it
Bring your posse
Watch 'em get ate
Like chicken and broccoli
Bizarre gettin' head
'Till I'm half dead
Watch the bitch slop
Like she had no -orrhea
Ramblin'
Steadily gavelin'
I'm tellin' raw
In a tuxedo in Hamilton boy
And that's the truth
We freestylin' so I'm gonna pass the mic' to Proof

[Verse 52: Swifty]
You can bring protection you gon' need it
My name is Swifty and I ain't tryna sound proceedic
When it's time to grab the mic' and get loose
We do shady stuff I snatch mics from Proof
You can't snatch mics from me
I snatch mics from many MC in this industry
Injuring MCs
It doesn't matter
Rhymes get better
That chit-chatter
You get [?]
Like cake mix
I don't scrit love
I scrit slug
So take six
That's the way they sound
My name is Swifty
It's goin' down

[Verse 53: Bizarre]
Now [?]
I'ma tell you the truth
Swift I don't want you to rap
I was tryna pass the mic' to Proof
But since you wanted to interrupt
Get the battle up and keep your dukes up and get smacked up
When I'm real
I feel
You dirty like you dirty beer

[Verse 54: Swifty]
We got this 300 pound Rooster head man
Tryna battle me
This is what we do man
You can't handle me slag
We not gonna battle each other because we're brothers
And we can put it down like no other
Smother-rin' MCs
It doesn't matter man
Peace

[Verse 55: Bizarre]
I'ma take your money
I'ma take your money with dice
You ain't got nothin' but some fake ice
So I don't want your money

[Verse 56: Swifty]
All right

Dom DeLuise please
Stop and get up off your knees
Don't tryna battle me man
Come on man but you know that you can't 'cause
It's hot and I'm tired
Day is expiring
I wanna retire
