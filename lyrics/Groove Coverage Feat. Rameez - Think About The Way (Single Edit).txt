Music is the vibe, so open up your eyes.
Time is running out, so find the feeling.

Think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, how some people play
Think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, think about the way.

I try to figure out my life
But life is going so insane
And all this pain and the trouble
All this pain in the game
I see my girl on another
Dancing on the fucking pole
And I'll be dancing undercover
While your girlfriend got a call

Uh, so think about the way, how we live today
So think about the way, how some people play
So think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, how some people play.

Think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, how some people play.

Music is the vibe, so open up your eyes.
Time is running out, so find the feeling.

Think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, how some people play
Think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, think about the way.

Think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, how some people play
Think about the way, how we live today
Think about the way, think about the way.
