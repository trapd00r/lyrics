You gotta live your life
You gotta learn to live

Life can kill you, it's written on you
But who is writin' - strucked by lightning
Pop - you gone changed, who planned it
What planet? I tought I had it, damn it
Amazing craze lost in a speedchase
My mind is a blur, foxy ladies fake like the fur
Words occur, reporters need more germs for terms
To sell well and excellence is just an expense
For what it's worth, it makes no sense
Living a lie under magnifing lense
It gets intense, so you promise yourself
Not to hate it but fade it - 'cause it really could be devastated
Revalueated, it's a game and you play it
You can say what you will but it always will be speculated
Turned around so the truths not found
Instead of your story - it's a new compound

You got to live your life
You got to find your own way
You got to learn to live (learn to live)
And make your own desicions yeah
You got to live your life (live your life)
That is how the story goes
You got to learn to give
Life is hard we all know yeah yeah

Spill your guts out, heard you talkin' bout
The way we changed 'cause we got some money now
Burning bridges, fukin' bitches
So much... that my nose is uplifted
Rumours going around talk of the whole town
Strange peeps comin' up - you better slowdown
It gets weird, so watch yourself
Evil lurks with in, it might take your health
I've seen men twice as tough come and go
No hard shoulder, just the elbow
The mental state of slave,
Camouflaged in a gansta teenage behave
Hold it, wait - no need to go that route, doubt
What you on about, singing blues on a crossroads
Get it together, it's all in your mind
Live the life and you will find

You got to live your life
You got to find your own way
You got to learn to live (learn to live)
And make your own desicions (yeah, yeah)
You got to live your life (live your life)
And that is how the story goes
You got to learn to give
Life is hard we all know (yeah, yeah)
You got to live your life
You got to find your own way
You got to learn to live (learn to live)
And make your own desicions (yeah, yeah)
You got to live your life (live your life)
That is how the story goes
You got to learn to give
Life is hard we all know (yeah yeah)
You gotta live your life
Go for yours

You gotta live your life
Go for yours
