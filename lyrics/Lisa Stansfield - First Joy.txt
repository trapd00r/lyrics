My first love, my first love
You gave me my first chance to be a woman
Forever I'll remember what you gave me
My first joy

My first love
You awoke my mind, my soul and my body
My first love
You opened my eyes

My first love, my first love
You gave me my first chance to be a woman
Forever I'll remember what you gave me
My first joy

Sweetheart you took away my fear and inhibitions
My first love
My sweetness and light

My first love, my first love
You gave me my first chance to be a woman
Forever I'll remember what you gave me
My first joy

That first kiss
Standing in the cold warming up the winter
It was bliss to be in your arms
It seemed we'd be that way forever
Together in love
And my first love you'll stay forever in my heart
