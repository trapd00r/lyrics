Baby, there's no way of knowing
If we've got a good thing going
Better not believe in true love
That's what people say
There's nothing fatal in attraction
I'm just looking for some action
Better not go chasing rainbows
That's what people say

Every time I see your face
Emotion takes control of me
It turns me round and puts me in a spin
Oh can't you see

I just wanna love you
I wanna be the one
Who's holding you tonight
I just wanna love you
Every minute of the hour
Every morning, noon and night

There's gotta be a way to show you
I'd really like to get to know you
I could make you happy
If you'd take a chance on me
Don't wanna talk about forever
Can't you see it's now or never
Don't think about tomorrow
Take a change on me

You know it makes me so excited
Every time I think of you
It turns me round and puts me in a spin
Oh can't you see

I just wanna love you
I wanna be the one
Who's holding you tonight
I just wanna love you
Every minute of the hour
Every morning, noon and night

I just wanna love you
I, I just wanna love you
(Holding you tonight)
I just wanna love you
I, I just wanna love you
(Every morning, noon and night)

Take a chance, take a chance, chance
Take a chance, take a chance
Take a chance on me
Take a chance, take a chance, chance
Take a chance, take a chance
Take a chance on me

Every time I see your face
Emotion takes control of me
It turns me round and puts me in a spin
Oh can't you see

I just wanna love you
I wanna be the one
Who's holding you tonight
I just wanna love you
Every minute of the hour
Every morning, noon and night

I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you
(Holding you tonight)
I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you
(Every morning, noon and night)

I just wanna love you
I wanna be the one
Who's holding you tonight
I just wanna love you
Every minute of the hour
Every morning, noon and night
