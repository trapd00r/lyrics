Oh, I was born a good boy my mama loved me so
And she gave me every chance she could to make my life a gold
But I fell in with the wrong crowd and the wrong crowd led me on
But I could have gone right just as easy as I went wrong

I went to the places where sin just waits for you
And I fell in with the wrong crowd like sinners always do
Now here I sit in prison just waiting for the day
When they'll lead me through that door and burn my life away

Oh mama please forgive me, the shame is all my own
For I could have gone right just as easy as I went wrong

Oh mama please forgive me, the shame is all my own
For I could have gone right just as easy as I went wrong
