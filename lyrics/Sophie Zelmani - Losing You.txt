I can tell by your look
There's something missing, something I took
I can tell by the way you sound
Won't be long, you won't be around

(CHORUS)
Oh, I'm losing you (x2)

Was it my words? Or my silence?
I know it hurts, my kind of violence
Won't you tell how I hurt you?
Won't be long, you won't be around

CHORUS
