[Chorus]
Don't sing love songs, you’ll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride

[Verse 1]
"All men are false," said my mother
"They’ll tell you wicked, loving lies
And the very next evening, they'll court another
Leave you alone to pine and sigh"

[Verse 2]
My daddy, he's a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link, a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged

[Verse 3]
So court another tender maiden
And hope that she will be your wife
For I have been warned and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life
