My friend Scott says there's flying saucers
Hiding inside our hollow moon (our hollow moon)
And then there's Karl, the card-carrying communist
Cause revolution's coming soon (it's coming soon)
And Carolyn believes in fairies
And Gabrielle believes in ghosts
Yeshe believes in reincarnation (we'll meet again)
And David, in heavenly hosts (heavenly hosts)

My mother believes that this physical universe
Is a big holographic show
And she says someday science'll catch up with her
Has she a shred of evidence?
No
