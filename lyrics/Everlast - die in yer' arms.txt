Girl, I wanna die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care about the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden but it's sweet and it's ripe
I think I'm gonna pick me some and take me a bite

Baby girl, looks so good, she walks so mean
Got a vicious little sway, I think she's semi-obscene
She'll pick your bones clean, oh, my God, she's so fine
She's sweeter than the dew out on the grapes on the vine

I'ma pick her, I'ma squeeze her, I'ma make me some wine
I'ma drink her till I'm a crazy, I'ma drink till I'm blind
I'ma touch her so good, I'ma treat her so fine
I'm gonna make love to her soul, I'm gonna fuck all with her mind

Girl, I wanna die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care about the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden but it's sweet and it's ripe
I think I'm gonna pick me some and take me a bite

Baby girl, acts so proper, like daddy's little daughter
A wolf in sheep's clothing, leading lambs out to the slaughter
She's looking so young, she's smelling so pretty
She's a junkie on a binge and her drug is the city

She's a vicious little bitty, attitude is shitty
If I get my way she's probably gonna come home with me
Talk ain't good for nothing, eyes are made for crying
Bombs are made for dropping, girl, yer arms were made for dying

Girl, I wanna die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care about the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden but it's sweet and it's ripe
I think I'm gonna pick me some and take me a bite

Girl, I wanna die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care about the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden but it's sweet and it's ripe
I think I'm gonna pick me some and take me a bite

Die in yer arms tonight
Care about the wrong or right
Forbidden but it's sweet and it's ripe
Pick me some and take me a bite
