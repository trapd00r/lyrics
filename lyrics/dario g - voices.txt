Voices                                                                                   Dario G

We sailed over seven seas
Searching for that missing key
Unlock a new
World harmony

Climb the highest mountain range
Then we took the longest train
Looking for our
Perfect refrain

I hear voices in the sky
(In the sky)
In the sky
(In the sky)

Hidden rhythms in the rivers run
Blinding beats in the desert sun
Hear them today
Play all as one

Distant voices in a far off sky
Led us to the elusive prize
To the new sound
We testify

Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Yey-E-Yeh
Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Yeh
(Etc)

(Chant)

There's hidden rhythms in the sun
In the sun
I hear voices in the sky
In the sky
