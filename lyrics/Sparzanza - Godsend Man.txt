Bloodstained hands accept my offer

Ravenous I search for more

Leaving you on the fl oor to suffer

I'm pitch black evil to the core

Godsend man

Born of fools Preaching to the mass

Obey my rules Godsend man

Get on your knees

You will find salvation in me

One last prayer and you hit the floor

He has been the one you've been searching and hoping for...

But not anymore godsend man acting like a whore

Godsend man all I want, want, want is more

Join me on my road to ruin

Hard to wander, hard to walk

Nothing you can do will stop me

Don't beg me on your knees like a fucking dog

Godsend man

Born of fools

Preachin' to the mass

Obey my rules Godsend man

Get on your knees

You will find salvation in me

One last prayer and you hit the floor

He has been the one you've been searching and hoping for...

But not anymore godsend man acting like a whore

Godsend man all I want, want, want is more
