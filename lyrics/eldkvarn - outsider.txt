here's a new constitution

nd it's tearing you to change your style

ould you like a revolution?

verybody's gonna wonder why


ou've been dyin'


hen you're out of the lemon

on't know where to begin

een like living in sin

oz you're a stranger

ou are back by the rules

o what's they taught you at school

hey make you be like a fool

oz you're a stranger in time


here's a twist to the story

ow we break the point of no return

ant a power, want a glory

re you gonna let you be just blind


've been dyin'


tranger in time

tranger in time

tranger in...


h, i've been dyin'

onna let you be just blind

ou've been cryin'


tranger in time

tranger in time
