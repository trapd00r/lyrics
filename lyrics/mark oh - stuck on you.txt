And yoo love it yeah
Check it out now
O come on come on come on
Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't loose
Yes I'm on my way
Needed a friend and the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you till the end
Yes I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
Mighty glad you stayed

Let me say o o o lets go
Come on

Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't loose
Yes I'm on my way
Needed a friend and the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you to the end
Yes I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
Mighty glad you stayed

I'll take it to the left if you take it to the write
I'll stay up all night with all of my mates (?)

O o o lets go

Dansing it makes you wanna move
Yes dansing it makes you wanna grove

Get on the floor and I'll give you more

On the floor can we give you more and more

O come on come on come on

Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't loose
Yes I'm on my way
Needed a friend and the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you to the end
Yes I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
Mighty glad you stayed

Let me say ooh lets go

Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't loose
Yes I'm on my way
Needed a friend and the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you to the end
Yes I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
Mighty glad you stayed
