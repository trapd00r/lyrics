(voice sample from Star Trek V) 
I couln't help but notice your pain 
My pain? 
It runs deep 
Share it with me! 

Ohhh pain...pain ...pain 

ohhh ohhh oh ohhh ohhh 
ohhh ohhh oh ohhh ohhh 

They'll never take me alive 
i'm gettin' high with my four-five 
Cocked on these suckas 
Time ta die 
Even as a youngster 
causin' ruckis on tha back of the bus 
i was a fool all through high school 
kickin' up dust 
but now i'm labled as a trouble maker 
who can you blame ? 
smokin' weed helped me take away the pain 
so i'm hopeless 
rollin' down the freeway swervin' 
don't worry 
i'm about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry 
maybe if they tried to understand me 
what should i do ? 
i had to feed my fuckin' family 
what else could i do 
but be a thug 
out slangin' with the homies 
fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club 
got my mind on danger 
never been a stranger ta homicide 
my cities full of gang bangers and drive bys 
why do we die at an early age 
he was so young 
but still a victom of the 12 guage 
my memories of a corpse 
mind full of sick thoughts 
and i ain't goin back to court 
so fuck what you thought 
im drinkin' hennessey 
runnin from my enemies 
will i live to be 23 
there's so much pain 

(Chorus) 

Ohhhh.... 
Tired of tha Strain and tha Pain 
(dont get to close because you might get shot) 
Ohhhh.... 
Tired of tha Strain and tha Pain 
(dont get to close because you might get shot) 

Years and years of that rough life 
runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife 
and livin trifed on the regular 
bokin out competitors 
see them take a move and take them down like a fuckin preditor 
get in trouble everyday in school 
act a fool 
and you know i had to break every rule 
showin off for the bitches cause i had the mad rep 
so i had to watch my back when it was time to step 
but the gimiest of grimeys with love for me 
uh, pop, pop 
and send a chuckle up above for me 
and yo currency kept passin me by but i didnt cry 
broke I head off with the pack and started sellin coke 
and now i'm tha one that's lookin lovely 
pop the drop top and all tha bitches want ta rub me 
kick'em the game 
it's all the same 
i kick it back yo 
give'em slack yo 
and now they lable me tha mack yo 
people check it 
get disrespected if you front on tha the birdman 
you heard man 
catch a couple shots from tha glock in my hand 
Damn! 
release some realistic with my biscuit 
you know you get your ass twisted so run for cover 
me and my man got a plan kickin' major dust 
so if your on nigga look for the guage to bust 
a lot of pressure with the street fame 
it's a deep game 
and my mama always cryin' 
yo there's so much pain 

(Chorus) 
Ohhhh.... 
Tired of tha Strain and tha Pain 
(dont get to close because you might get shot) 
Ohhhh.... 
Tired of tha Strain and tha Pain 
(dont get to close because you might get shot) 

They got me mobbin like i'm 
loc'ed and ready to get my slug on 
i load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on 
i ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me 
trust 
i got my glock cocked playa if they press me 
bust some motherfuckers with a PASSION 
better duck cause i ain't lookin when i'm BBBBLASTIN 
i'm a nut and drinkin hennessey 
and gettin' high 
on tha lookout for my enemies 
don't wanna die 
tell me why 
cause this stress is gettin' major 
a buck fifty across my face with my razor 
what can i do but be a thug until i'm dead and gone 
keep my brain on tha game and stay head strong 
these sorry bastards 
want to kill me in my sleep but will they can i see 
and everyday it just a struggle 
steady thuggin' in the streets 
and i'll be ballin' loc 
don't let'em make you worry 
keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried 
i was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta, 
word ta motha im touched 
i'm kickin dust up 
ready ta bust 
i'm on the scene steady muggin' me 
until they kill me 
i'll be livin this life 
i know you feel me baby
