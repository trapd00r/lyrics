Maybe hurting
Is as grand as loving
So grand you can't
Escape nowhere

As it's giving
Wounds are taking
Hard though to tell
What that'd might be
I can just close my eyes
And let you stand outside

Maybe favours
Can be disquised and
Disasters what lighten up
A better way

So maybe hurting
Is as grand as loving
Maybe hurting
Is as grand as loving
