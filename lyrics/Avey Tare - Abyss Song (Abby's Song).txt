(Where are you?)
I'm in a happy room
Where everything is right
What's looking at the well
And looking at the green
And children all around
Jumping in the air
And looking at the well
Through flowers in the trees
There's the house where I grew up
I'm walking towards its door
The porch floorboards are green
And six windows in the door
Others, they–

The clouds have come inside
But I keep passing through
And there are green carpets there
Me and my yellow shoes
There are children everywhere
This is a house of mine
Over there's some handsome well
I'm standing everywhere
She had yellow hair
Above me on the bed
But it was a bunk bed
Their stories there were read
(I really– I can't wait to meet you)

It's taking a long time
I think I'll swim on by
