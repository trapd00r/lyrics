I once thought I really knew
I once thought I really knew myself
hey well
and things might really look all good
but you just need to cross the line of you
I told myself

Simon says, sit down well
Simon says, you can't help yourself
Simon says, you can't help yourself
Just do youremondid-and-done
he said, dead wrong, you're dead wrong

And I'll never forget
nobody knows,
nobody knows,
where we are now
and I'll never forget
nobody knows
nobody knows
who we are now

And I'll never forget
nobody knows,
nobody knows,
where we are now
and I'll never forget
nobody knows
nobody knows
who we are now

and every night
I let go I let go
every day
I'm awake
awake in a different shape

And I'll never forget
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
who we are now
now
…

and I once thought I always really knew
I once thought I really knew my
my limits
Simon says,
to much to do
Simon says
give up dont even bother
dont even bother
I know,
I'm not the only who
Do you're mondid-and-done
and see the things we overcome
we would feel flattered
and we play
Simon says,
to much to do
Simon says
give up dont even bother
dont even bother

and I'll never forget
nobody knows
nobody knows
where we are now
and I'll never forget
nobody knows
nobody knows
who we are now
and I'll never forget…
who we are now
and I'll never forget
nobody knows who we are now
