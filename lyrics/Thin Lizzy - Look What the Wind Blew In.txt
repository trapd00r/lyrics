In the dismal darkness
I have sat and gazed, amazed
At the blazing factories

Like a lonely man
Who stands on the seashore and
I am afraid

As weary as I be
I try I see my sceen
To looks ok

Run, boy, run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Many lovely ladies
I have felt, touched
And I was not afraid

I took them out dancing
Fool out romancing
And I was not afraid

Then somewhere from the north
This gale I knew just flew in
And I am afraid

Run, boy, run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Run, boy, run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Run, you got to run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Look what the wind just blew in
You got to look what the wind just blew in
Oh, You got to look what the wind just blew in
