Me and my helmet 
Such an unconventional kid 
All intense and kinetic 
At best tolerated from afar 

Not yet arrested 
And by that I mean betrothed 
Though at start I am duly courted 
I've just not been trusted with altars 

I'm a sweet piece of work 
Well intentioned yet disturbed 
Wrongly labeled and underfed 
Treated like a rose as an orchid 

My friends as they weigh in 
Get understandably protective 
They have a hard time being objective 
So inside, we cancel each other out 

I'm a sweet piece of work 
Well intentioned and unloved  
Unlabeled and misunderstood 
Treated like a rose as an orchid 

You've brought water to me 
Making sure my bloom rebounds 
You know best of what my special care allows 

So I've lived in my blind spot 
Thought myself usual when I'm not 
In your garden is a nice spot 
As long as it is brave and where you are 

For this sweet piece of work 
High maintenance and deserted 
I've been different and deserving 
Treated like a rose as an orchid 

Sweet piece of work 
Overwhelmed unobserved 
I've been bowed down to but so misread 
Treated like a rose as an orchid.
