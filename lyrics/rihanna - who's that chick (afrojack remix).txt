Feel the adrenaline
Moving under my skin
It's and addiction
Such an eruption

Sound is my remedy
Feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dancefloor
Bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard
Blazing through my beating heart

French kissing on the floor
Heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy off the crazy juice
This will end up on the news

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Ultrassexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Oh oh oh ooh oh

Ultrassexual
The night has got me love sprung

Beating like a disco drum...
Beating like a disco drum...

She's been a crazy dita
