Seven hours since you went away
Eleven coffees, Ricki Lake on play
But late at night when I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I think of you

Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home

They say
Why you cry
For the guy?
Say goodbye
Run away
Why you cری
For the guy?
Say goodbye
I said ok, 'cause...

Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

Eleven hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue

Seven hours, what you calling for?
A bunch of flowers and I'll slam the door
You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
Takes more than begging to reverse my brain
'Cause...

Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

I'm through with it
Over it
Not having it
Crazy shit
Not feeling this
Can't deal, I quit
No more, No more
I'm through with it
Not having it
This crazy shit
Not feeling it
Can't deal with it
No more, I quit
No more, no more

Breaking off the bun
A brand new day has just begun
Just because you made me go "ooh"
Doesn't mean I'll put up with you
Don't you dare turn back
Can't you see I won't take that?
I ain't crying over you
Better fill your head up like I told you

Why you cry
For the guy?
Say goodbye
Run away
Why you cry
For the guy?
Say goodbye
I said ok, 'cause...

Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy (such a fool)

Ooh, boy you miss me like a hole in the head
Because I do boy (I do)
And it's cool boy (yeah it's cool)
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy, (I do boy)
Such a fool boy (such a fool)
