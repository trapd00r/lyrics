Oh love, right from the start
We were old love, like we've never been parted
You kissed me, your hands down my side
To my hips dear, shivers and sighs
All the breathing from your mouth through mine
I got high on this hunger for one more time
Lover of mine, when I'm with you
I felt so good, tell this tale to me

Well I wouldn't believe that I'm already here
Tell this tale to me
I wouldn't believe that I'm already here

Oh love, you covered my skin
With your eyes as they found me
I kissed you, danced in your scent
And fell into a never-ending moment
Of a whisper from your mouth through mine
With those words that gently filled my lungs
Lover of mine, when I'm with you
I forget how am I to be alone
Living without you
Spend another day passing by you
Don't wanna know how it feels if I do

Tell this tale to me
I wouldn't believe
That I'm already here

Tell this tale to me
I wouldn't believe
That I'm already here

Tell me, is this real?
No, I won't believe
I won't believe

No, I won't believe
No, I won't believe
No, I won't believe
