I'm always making up my own time
I'm never where you want me to be
I'm always coloring inside of the lines
I'll never be the girl on TV
If I have my chances then men choose me

I'll never be Miss America (Miss America)
It's not the way I always wanted to be
Don't need a crown to make me a queen
I'll never be Miss America (Miss America)
Despite my mama she told me
"Girl, there's so many ways to be beautiful"
(Be beautiful, beautiful)

I'm always crashing into something
I'm always waking up the party
I'm the one whose always singing
Louder than the rest, louder than the others
(Louder than the rest, louder than the others)

I'll never be Miss America (Miss America)
It's not the way I always wanted to be
Don't need a crown to make me a queen
I'll never be Miss America (Miss America)
Despite my mama she told me
"Girl, there's so many ways to be beautiful"

I am beautiful, beautiful
You are beautiful, beautiful
Despite my mama she told me, "girl" (beautiful, beautiful)
"There's so many ways to be" (beautiful)
I'll never be Miss America (beautiful, beautiful)
I'll never be

I'll never be (I'll never be)
I'll never be Miss America (Miss America)
It's not the way I always wanted to be
Don't need a crown to make me a queen (I'll never be)
I'll never be Miss America (Miss America)
Despite my mama she told me
"Girl, there's so many ways to be beautiful"

I am beautiful, beautiful
You are beautiful, beautiful
You are beautiful, beautiful
You are beautiful
