One more time I saddle up up and leavefor no man's land
Like so many times before
They say that lightning strikes not once but twice and I
Ain't gonna stay
'Cause I can't take anymore

When memories make themselves heard
Go away - go away
You know that you gave me your word
Gonna go on my own

Time, time take me where
I'm no longer a stranger
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way
Time, time take me there
And with the speed of lightning
I'll do anything
I know I'll find my way

Now I know, here's where the story ends and I have come
To the point of no return
And when I looking back at the times where it all began
I know
That I still have much to learn

When memories make themselves hard
Go away - go away
You know that you gave me your word
Gonna go on my own

Time, time take me where
I'm no longer a stranger
I'll do anything
I know I'll find a way
Time, time take me there
And with the speed of lightning
I'll do anything
I know I'll find my way

Gonna go on my own!

'Cause I can't take any more, not gonna stay,
I ain't gonna stay,
Time, time will take me there (I don't wanna run away)
But I will go anyway, I know your all alone ('cause I can't take anymore not gonna stay)
