Hall√•, aa
I see, it's fine
You're somebody else's little girl now and will never be mine
But give me a minute, let me get through to you, yeah
I will continue to call you repeatedly 'til you do

Summer night, you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When in dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we could do it all night long
Reconsider me baby, come on

Girl, you're making this terrible stupid mistake
Hanging 'round with that guy ain't right, I'm for real, he's fake
I know that signal, that's a call on the other line, oh
And your boyfriend would sure check that out but I'm not that kind

Summer night, you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When in dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we could do it all night long, yeah
Reconsider me baby, come on

Summer night, you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When in dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we should do it all night long, yeah
Reconsider me baby, come on

Summer night, you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When in dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we could do it all night long, yeah
Reconsider me baby, come on
Oh, oh, oh
