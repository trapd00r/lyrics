You can wear your new white shoes
In the muddy afternoon
Walking past the day drunks, too
They whistle with their hands
But I could be your catcall, too
Anything you want to do
Anything you want to do

You can take your slide trombone
Play it in the catacombs
Find a town that moves real slow
And turn it on its head
And I could be your pharaoh's tomb
Anything you wanna do
Lover, anything you wanna do

If you want to be common
I can claim that I tamed you
A demigod in a bonnet
They're going to know it ain't true

You can paint your nails lime green
Rent yourself a limousine
Kidnap the professor's niece
Let's tell them that she's dead
We'll party in a hotel room
Anything you want to do
Sister, anything you want to do

You can get your hair all wet
Sleeping on the riverbed
Kiss a frog and then dissect
You got to find out what's inside
But you can have my bad side, too
Anything you want to do
Sugar, anything you want to do

And if you want to be common
I will claim that I tamed you
A demigod in a bonnet
They're going to know it ain't true

And yes, you are King David's star
And the crescent moon, and the crescent moon
You must sweep the Bodhi tree
I sit beneath, oh I sit beneath

You can wear your new white shoes
In the dirty afternoon
Walking through the traffic fumes
A flower in your hair
And I will swing upon your moods
Anytime you want me to
Just tell me what you want to do
Lover, anything you want to do
Lover, anything you want to do
