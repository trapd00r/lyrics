[Intro]
(Yeah)
Yo what the fuck is up though? (What up though bitches?)
It's Kuniva you know who the fuck I am nigga (Fo' sho')
That representing for them dirtiest niggas (D12)
Flat out, niggas don't know the deal wit' it (Blah, blah, blah)
It's for every nigga (Yeah)
Every bitch (Your mom's worthy)
Whoever the fuck you is, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
A man can only be defined by his actions
No matter if he's acting or flashing a blast
Just imagine if you trapped in a circle of snakes, niggas act fake
But when guns bust, they all runnin' like a fast break
Love and hate, 4 letter words, exact opposites
I can recognize that hate through your compliments
I got something to knock you off your feet and unconscious with
Words written in a stone like biblical documents
Nigga you better acknowledge it
Don't take it as a threat but a warning, tryna sneak around me on some coward shit
I'm way smarter, more powerful than you ever thought
More deadlier than a bullet any nigga ever caught
When egos collide, war comes and heaters reside
You said you ain't afraid to blast back and neither am I
Either decide, you're gonna reside on the wrong side
Realize I ain't taking on shorts by a long slide

[Hook]
To every block there's a morgue, every nigga, every whore
Every snitch every bitch, every groupie on tour
For every shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
I'm never too famous to stop and dropkick ya
In every block there's a morgue, every nigga, every whore
Every snitch every bitch, every groupie on tour
For every shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
I'm never too famous to stop in dropkick ya

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm full grown, stand on my own the hood's home
Running ave's on, deadlier than eight full blown
Not a wannabe, I instruct orderly conduct
The results can leave you permanently with your eyes shut
Nigga now what? A man's best-friend is only knowledge
Advance can be a lesson you can never learn in college
I lived life and learned that friends can turn on you
Bitches can get you buried with bugs and worms on you
Make a mistake and get your vital organs erased
Then substitute it with a rat in a wheel runnin' in place
I'm street smart, I whip niggas that ain't about shit
Knock 'em off their air-force ones and FUBU outfits
Pop shit, tell me how you gonna let your Glock spit
And make my anger hold my common sense for hostage
And when it's on niggas tap out after I blackout
I be all over you bitches like some narcs in the crack house

[Hook]
To every block there's a morgue, every nigga, every whore
Every snitch every bitch, every groupie on tour
For every shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
I'm never too famous to stop and  dropkick ya
In every block there's a morgue, every nigga, every whore
Every snitch every bitch, every groupie on tour
For every shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
I'm never too famous to stop in dropkick ya

[Verse 3]
Come and fuck wit' it, still old school like Chet Lemon
Niggas thinking they got something to prove like tough midgets
I don't play games unless they come with two joysticks
Control shit, bringing that voice, or all annoyed
The ones in the back of the bar making all the noise
Not saying the word to us, that's about the wisest choice that you ever made
The metal spray, get wrapped in the bat like better maid
Sever veins, Beretta's made to sweater stains
So clever game remember that name Kuniva nigga
Pistol whipping you on the nigga that's riding wit' ya
I'm a walking puzzle, if I love you I'll hug you
A human pit without a muzzle always ready to slug you
I can be your best friend or your best enemy
Just set it off a little, I'll handle the rest willingly
Welcome to the mind of a the derelict intertwined with the heretics
Of a barbaric regiment, glutton residence

[Hook]
To every block there's a morgue, every nigga, every whore
Every snitch every bitch, every groupie on tour
For every shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
I'm never too famous to stop and  dropkick ya
In every block there's a morgue, every nigga, every whore
Every snitch every bitch, every groupie on tour
For every shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
I'm never too famous to stop in dropkick ya

[Outro]
Block there's a morgue
Nigga, whore, snitch, bitch, every groupie on tour
Shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
Every block there's a morgue
Nigga, whore, snitch, bitch, groupie on tour
Shot hitter, Glock spitter, spot getter, rock splitter
