Finally, the sky is blue
Last night, my friends dragged me to some lake
We drove there real late, we went too fast
Sipping cheap sangria in the backseat
Everybody are laughing and we are listening to our favorite songs
But I thought you said summer is going to take the pain away

January brought a headache
In February, it got even worse
And when you thought it couldn't get more awful
Say hello to March
April brought me to a funeral
Gained another ten pounds in May
But I thought you said summer is going to take the pain away

Have you ever had the feeling no one really knows what you're all about
And when you try to show them
They all have things to do tonight
Tonight

Up on a roof, looking over the city
All by myself thinking:
There is nowhere I would rather be than here, so why am I not
Like the others, and why are you not here with me doing crossword puzzles
Saying: it's going to be okay
Summer's going to take the pain away
When I'm gone, I promise
It's going to be okay
Summer is going to take the pain away

Have you ever had the feeling no one really knows what you're all about
And when you try to show them
They all have things to do tonight
Tonight

Finally, the sky is blue
Last night, my friends dragged me to some lake
