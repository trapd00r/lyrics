If you're alone and you need a friend
Someone to make you forget your problems
Just come along baby, take my hand
I'll be your lover tonight

Whoaa whoaa
This is what I wanna do
Whoaa whoaa
Let's have some fun
Whoaa whoaa
One on one just me and you
Whoaa whoaa

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna go boom boom
And spend the night together
Together in my room

Whoaa whoaa
Everybody get on down

Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom 
I wanna go boom boom
And spend the night together
Together in my room

Boom boom boom boom

Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom
I wanna go boom boom
And spend the night together
Together in my room

Whoaa whoaa
