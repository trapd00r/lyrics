Virgil Caine is the name
And I served on the Danville train
Till Stoneman's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again

In the winter of sixty-five
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember oh so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went: "Na, na-na, na na na..."

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me:
"Virgil, quick come see
There goes Robert E. Lee"

Now I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need
And ya leave the rest
But they should never
Have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went: "Na, na-na, na na na..."

Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand

He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up
When he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went: "Na, na-na, na na na..."

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went: "Na, na-na, na na na..."
