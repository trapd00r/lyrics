[Intro: Rihanna] 
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?

[Rap: Drake]
Yeah.
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 something, right?
'Cause I've been tryin' to work it out, ooh

Good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio

Ooh, let it play, say you gotta leave,
But I know you wanna stay
You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name

Wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as I you go, the text that I write is gon' say

[Chant]
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
Boy, you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge
Let's explore your talent

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh...Oh oh oh oh...

Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh...Oh oh oh oh... 

[Chant]
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Baby, you got me
And ain't no where that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth, you rock me, yeah...
So I surrender, to every word you whisper
Every door you enter...I...will let you in

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh...Oh oh oh oh...

[Bridge: Rihanna]
You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
Thats why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You 'bout to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind

[Chant]
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh...Oh oh oh oh...

Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Oh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work a
Oh oh oh oh...Oh oh oh oh...
