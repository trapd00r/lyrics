Honestly, what will become of me?
Don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But really life is dandy
We are we don't see
Miss everything daydreaming

Traveling, I only stop at exits 
Wondering if I'll stay 
Young and restless 
Living this way I stress less 
I want to pull away when the dream dies 
The pain sets in and I don't cry 
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

Hoping it would come soon 
So that they could die

Well, the dogs were barking at the new moon 
Whistling a new tune 
Hoping it would come soon 

And the sun was wondering if it should stay away for a day 
Till the feeling went away 
And the sky was falling
And the clouds were dropping 
And the rainfall got have to bring salvation

The dogs were barking at the new moon 
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon 
So that they could die
