Moonlit girls hiding in the dunes
Stars are falling like rockets in ruins
I'm in the meadows where the roses bloom
The orange blossoms shaking loose
Lovers talking like lovers do
Summer's twilights had them fooled

Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Clap your hands, stomp your boots
Yonder come the blues

My feet are planted in the waist-high reeds
In the shadows in the shade of trees
Through the kingdom's smoky leaves
You'd be laughing too if you could see
On the outskirts long and lean
Not baring gifts on a jet black steed

Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Ain't no rumor, it's simply true
Yonder come the blues

A dozen finger and an easy touch
Throwing ashes in the pixie dust
Locked and loaded right off the bus
It's got us numbered, the two of us
Sing that gospel and get your thrills
Raise the roof off and strike the bell
You'd be dancing too if you could tell
It's waking up and coming out of its shell

Down the boulevard sirens pass
Into the underworld deep and black
With brass and ladders, pick and axe
Down the stairwell through the blast
Single file out, don't be last
Not every one of us is coming back

Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Move on back and let them through
Yonder come the blues
