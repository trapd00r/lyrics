When everything I do just make
Me feel the same
I need to get away
To somewhere far away
I wonder, why is that
I can't play the game
And find another way
To focus and take aim

Going away to clear my mind
I know I need it when
I have to start again
Going away, I know I'll find
Somewhere I can be myself once again

Whenever I am far up in the air
No one knows where I am
Where I'm going
So far up in the air
Trying to let go
Cause here I know how
To live day by day

I know that this can't be
Nobody's fault but mine
Tried to be everywhere
Like anyone would care
I always thought that everything
Would be just fine
If I just played it fair
But now I crossed the line

Going away to clear my mind
I know I need it when
I have to start again
Going away, I know I'll find
Somewhere I can be myself once again

Whenever I am far up in the air
No one knows where I am
Where I'm going
So far up in the air
Trying to let go
Cause here I know how
To live day by day

You know I'll be there
When you feel that I'm drifting away
You know I'm far from here
But you know I still care
You know I still care
