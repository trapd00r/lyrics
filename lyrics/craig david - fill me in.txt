I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out she'd phone
Say 'hey boy, come on right around'
So I knock at the door, you were standing
With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told be 'bout Jacuzzi, sounded interesting so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping 'round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone, red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say 'hey girl, come on right around'
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down bounce, bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cos you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property, said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

All they seem to do, is be checking up on you, baby
Watching your every move
Think some day, they might approve, baby..........

Why were you creeping 'round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone, red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in
