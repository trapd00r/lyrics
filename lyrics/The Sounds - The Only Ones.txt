Where I grew up it was different
There was no violence or like other towns
But when I came home from school that night
I saw the cops were on the run
There were kids on the wall reaching up to the sky
Like a culture shock of joy
It sent me into a strong fascination
And what's been lost is back

'Cause we were the only ones
Darling and Me this time it's going down

You know where I belong
And you know it's time that we let go
Been drifting so far away from home
November came back and all was gone
You know where I belong, my darling
This time it's going down

When December came I was older
And snow was finally on the ground
Soldiers lining up, cameras feeding the world
With pictures that would mark my mind
I heard his woman scream as she was begging for trust
Then turning ghost-like behind the court
A shotgun blast, as new years passed
Oppression was on the run

'Cause we were the only ones
Darling and Me this time they're going down

You know where I belong
You know it's time that we let go
Been drifting so far away from home
November came back and all was gone
You know where I belong, my darling
This time they're going down

They're going down

You know where I belong
You know it's time that we let go
Been drifting so far away from home
November came back and now it's gone
You know where I belong, my darling
It's going down
