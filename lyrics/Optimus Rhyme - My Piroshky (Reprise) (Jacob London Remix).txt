I'm a car pool lane outlaw it's 5:30 y'all
And yeah I'm that dude with a mannequin
You want to get mad and report me then call
It takes more than that to get Wheelie panickin'
Everyday I plan my escape
From the East side through the city can't be late
To the practice space see we gotta create
It takes time just to make it to eleventh and pine
Hushhhhhh was the spot but we left the ID
Hiked up the hill now nobody can find me
I hide away like three times a week
Must stress test an experimental beat seeeee (Weeeeee)
Start drinking at rehearsal
Snag a six pack then request a reimbursal
Ha, do anything to make it on time
Got a black ski mask screaming down I-5

It's Saturday night Halle-lu-lu-lu-iah-iah
It's Saturday night Halle-lu-lu-lu-iah-iah iah-iah

Hey, man, I'm sorry that I missed your show
But it was late and I was tired, and hey, well you know
How it goes when you gotta get up and all that
But anyway I'll talk to you later, call me back
Seeeee I got to do a lot of gabbing
Just to get these shows lined up way before the crowd be clapping
You ever wonder what happens
In the back room of the club where those managers be napping
They say the people better pack in
If you don't move enough booze then you're not getting back in
It's all numbers it's all good to me
Give us drink tickets and we'll rock it happily
Seeeeee we'll sober up by the time we gotta leave
Theeeeeee show promoters got tricks up their sleeve
I've seen everything, every scam, every scheme
And if you got a problem talk to the bee

(Buzz buzz y'all, that's right it's the bee, everybody just calm down)

It's Saturday night Halle-lu-lu-lu-iah-iah
It's Saturday night Halle-lu-lu-lu-iah-iah iah-iah
It's Saturday night Halle-lu-lu-lu-iah-iah
It's Saturday night Halle-lu-lu-lu-iah-iah iah-iah

I wake up late on a Saturday hungover from a show last night that we palyed
With this crew down there with the Chop Suey had a lot of allies at the ralley, but hey
Feeling kinda hungry hit Broadway "Naw dude I ain't got no spare change."
Hate it when theses broke teenagers approach me; slide by quickly get my Piroshky
