Good evening, topping nightcast--a possible link between murder and music
Hey, hey, we're the Junkies!
Hey, hey, we're the Junkies!
Sticky pages in Hello with Hopper as Nero on Rome
See the social big guns going bang, bang, bang
Hey, hey, we're the Junkies!
Hey, hey, we're the Junkies!
Hey, hey, we're the Junkies!
No Xmas for Junkies..
Who put the U
Who put the U
Who put the U in the wamba?
So fashionably blue
Crime never pays, heroes are handsome,
So fashionably blue
Pretty children are popular, ugly children cynical
So fashionably blue
Mothers never work, single women always do
So fashionably blue
Politics doesn't exist, automobiles screech when they come to a stop
So fashionably blue
All problems are solved in slightly less than half an hour
