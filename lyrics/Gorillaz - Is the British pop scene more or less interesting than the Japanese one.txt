[Verse 1]
Love, I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

[Verse 2]
Love, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces (bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)

[Bridge]
My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
(Why?)

[Outro]
'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (bitch), are ruined (fuck!)
