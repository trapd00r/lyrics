I'm the girl who almost died
I guess that's what it took
To open up my eyes

And I'm everyone's best friend
You may hate me
But I'll be here 'til the end

And you say it won't be very long
Well let me live just to write one more song
And the wind is blowing strong
You were with her all along

And you're the boy who has to lie
I was hoping I could open up your eyes
Just keep living like you do
And everything you've done will come back to you

And I say that it won't be very long
It's a shame that we can't get along
And the wind is blowing strong
You were with her all along
