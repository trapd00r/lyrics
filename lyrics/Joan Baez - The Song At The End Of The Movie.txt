This is the song at the end of the movie
When the house lights go on
The people go home
The plot's been resolved
It's all over

This is the day after the last sad goodbye
That took so long
My true love is gone
He's left me alone
We're all over

I am the girl with her face in her hands
Crying love forsaken
I'm left badly shaken

This is the letter he left on the stairwell
That seemed so unreal
With words that could kill
I'll send you the bill
When it's over

This is the song at the end of the movie
When the house lights go on
The people go home
The plot's been resolved
It's all over
All over
