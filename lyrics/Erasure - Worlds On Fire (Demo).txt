Across the sea, the sea of love
And when it's dark I rise above
Move slowly through the quiet air
I hear your voice, it takes me there

Call my name aloud and I'll be there for you
There is no end to all the things that I would do

Stop your crying and dry up your endless tears
Don't you know you've got the key, love sets you free
Worlds on fire, full of pain and endless fear
Don't you know, open your eyes, love sets you free

I hold you tight, my mind is clear
True love in sight, hurt desappears
We are space, a lonely race
A speck of dust upon the face

You are magnificent, and I am here for you
There is no end to all the things that I would do

Stop your crying and dry up your endless tears
Don't you know, you've got the key, love sets you free
Worlds on fire, full of pain and endless fear
Don't you know, open your eyes, love sets you free

Stop your crying and dry up your endless tears
Don't you know, you've got the key, love sets you free
Worlds on fire, full of pain and endless fear
Don't you know, open your eyes, love sets you free
