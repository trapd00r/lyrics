How I remember sleepless nights
When we would read by candlelight,
And on the windowpane outside
A new world made of snow

A million feathers falling down,
A million stars that touch the ground,
So many secrets to be found
Amid the falling snow.

[Chorus]
Maybe I am falling down.
Tell me should I touch the ground?
Maybe I won't make a sound
In the darkness all around.

The silence of a winter's night
Brings memories I hold inside,
Remembering a blue moonlight
Upon the fallen snow.

[Chorus]

I close my window to the night.
I leave the sky her tears of white.
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow.

And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow.
