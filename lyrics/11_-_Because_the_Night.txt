Scrolling through my cellphone for the 20th time today
Reading the text you sent me again
Though I memorized it anyway

It was an afternoon in December
When it reminded you of the day
When we bumped into each other
But you didn't say hi 'cause I looked away

And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night

'Cause it's 12: 51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

And I saw you with her
Didn't think you'd find another
And my world just seemed to crash
Shouldn't have thought that this would last

And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night

'Cause it's 12: 51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer

As the sky outside gets brighter
And my eyes begin to tire
I'm slowly drowning in memories of him
And I know it shouldn't matter
As my heart begins to shatter
I'm left to wonder
Just how it should have been yeah

12: 51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed
I'm not thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on
Cause I'll prove you wrong that I can move on through this song
So much stronger
Oh oh oh oh...
