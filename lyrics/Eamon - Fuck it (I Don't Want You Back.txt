See, I don't.. know why.. I liked you so much,
I gave you all of my trust..
I told you.. I loved you.. 
Now that's all down the drain..
You put me through pain..
I wanna let you know how I feel..

::CHORUS::

Fuck what I said.. It don't mean shit now..
Fuck the presents, might as well throw 'em out..
Fuck all those kisses, they didn't mean jack..
Fuck you, you hoe.. I don't want you back..

Fuck what I said.. It don't mean shit now..

You thought.. you could.. Keep this shit from me..
Yeah, you burned bitch.. I heard the story..
You played me.. You even gave him head..

You're just another hag..
Look elsewhere 'cause you're done with me..
