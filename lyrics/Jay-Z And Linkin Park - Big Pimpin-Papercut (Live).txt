[Jay-Z and Mike Shinoda:]
Ha ha
You're wasting your talent, Randy

Yeah
Ready?

[Mike Shinoda:]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right

[Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington:]
Why does it look like night today?
Something inside's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches every time they lie
Face that laughs every time they fall
And watches everything

So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

[Mike Shinoda:]
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right

[Jay-Z:]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
'Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em looking good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezing
Talking 'bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's "beep beep" and I'm picking 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'mma break bread
So you can be living it up? Shit I...
Parts with nothing, y'all be fronting
Me? Give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothing, never happen
I'll be forever macking
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waiting.
Hoe, get your ass in
