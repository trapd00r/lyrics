Now I feel like breaking laws
Go on start a civil war
Here's my fist, where's the fight?
Your world is collapsing tonight

[Chorus:]
I want to make some noise, alright, alright
I want to drop some bombs, alright, alright
I want to make some noise, alright, alright
You tell me what can go wrong, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright now

Now I feel like dropping bombs
Black out your house if you're at home
Hurt but healed still coming on
In the mess where I'm from

[Chorus]
You know I'm on the other side
So tell me now am I right on time
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough of it

[Chorus x2]
