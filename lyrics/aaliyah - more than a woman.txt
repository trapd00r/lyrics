Passion, instant
Sweat me, feel me
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing
Tempt me, drive me
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely

I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your others
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
Making love under covers
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you

Midnight grindin'
My heart rate's climbin'
You go, I go
'Cause we share pillows
Taste me, feed me
There's still no separating
Morning massages
With new bones in your closet

I don't think you're ready
I don't think you're ready
For this thing
For this thing
I don't think you're ready
For this thing
You're not ready
I don't think you're ready
For this thing
This thing, this thing
I don't think you're ready
For this thing

Constant pleasures
No scale can measure
Secret treasures
Keeps on getting better
Do you wanna roll with me?
We can go to foreign lands
Your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like Bonnie and Clyde
Be by your side
