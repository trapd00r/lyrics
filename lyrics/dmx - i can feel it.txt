Man
Sometimes, sometimes you just know, you just know, that's all 

[Chorus - Nardo] 
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, oh lord 
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life 
oh lord, oh lord

[DMX]
The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger 
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under 
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile 
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child 
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it 
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it 
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you 
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you 
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends 
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey 
Those are your friends 
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know 
What you askin' for, did you ask for more? 
Should the casket door swing here, it is done 
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run 
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster 
It is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer 

[Chorus] 

[DMX]
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks 
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks 
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams 
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams 
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go 
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow 
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion 
some of us may do the winnin' 
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin' 
Easy goin up or down what have you been provin'? 
Jus that you were fuckin' ground 
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it 
An I know that deep down you really don't want it 
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father 
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder 
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife 
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night 
Come on! 

[Chorus]

[DMX]
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, cuz its outta my hands 
Lotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans 
An a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog 
Families by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue 
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', errrrrrr 
the growlin', shhhhhh, the prowlin' 
Don't know love, can't show love 
That means you gonna need more love 
than on old thug, but hold up, roll up 
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is 
what's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know 
Why you died in your house, why they lied to your spouse 
Told her it was suicide, but you an I 
Both know the truth will never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob 
Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log 
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there 
This is hell an we both here 
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah 

[DMX]
I remember, I remember dont worry, how could i ever forget, it's the first time the last time, we ever met, but I know the reason why you keep your silence up, no you dont fool me the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows it's no stranger to you or me

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Arf, arf 
Haha 
Aroo, arro 
Whoo, whoo, whoooo
