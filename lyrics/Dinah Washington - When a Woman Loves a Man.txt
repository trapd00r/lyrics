Love, to a man, is just a thing apart
To take or leave according to his whim
Love, to a woman means her very heart
She only wants to live her life for him.

Maybe he's not much,
Just another man doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man.
She'll just string along all through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman loves a man

She'll be the first one to praise him when he's going strong
The last one to blame him when everything's wrong
It's such a one sided game that they play
But women are funny that way.

Tell her she's a fool,
She'll say yes I know but I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man

She'll be the first one to praise him when he's going strong
The last one to blame him when everything's wrong
It's such a one sided game that they play
But women are funny that way.

Tell her she's a fool,
She'll say yes I know but I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man
