What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back
Back into time

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy
I'll go insane

You've got your problems baby and I've got mine
Lets just end it all by putting it together, yeah
When you say you love me It don't mean a thing
If you cared You'd be there Like you used to be, yeah

I'm searching for the words to make you realize
That I really, really want you to stay, Oh yeah
Tears of frustration I hold inside
But if you walk away you'll make this grown man cry

Chorus:
Don't leave
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight (nah baby, nah baby, nah baby)
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me to

Forget my pride girl I'm begging you You're my heart
You're my soul you've got so much control
My love runs deeper than the ocean and sea
But if you sail away you'll take the center piece of me, don't, don't leave no, no

Chorus (2X)

(Instrumental Break)
No, no, no don't leave

Chorus (2X)

Stay (come on and stay with me)
Stay (don't leave)
Stay (oh, yeah, yeah)
Stay right here with me forever (I love you)

Stay (yes I do)
Stay (I need you)
Stay (don't leave with out you)
Stay right here with me forever

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, crazy, crazy insane
If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, I'll go insane
If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy (crazy, crazy), I'll go insane

Stay (please stay with me)
Stay (forever)
Stay (forever)
Stay right here with me forever
(Baby don't take your love away, no, no, no, no)

Stay (stay with me)
Stay (cuz you know I love you)
Stay (you know I need you )
Stay right here with me forever
(Yes I do, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
