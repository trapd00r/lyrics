Hey you slaves go hang your owners
Draw your names among their ashes
Lay your children on their thrones
Gather 'raound and fall right down

Here at sundown nothing is when
Everything is all right
Switch opens
Opening around and let's the garden rise

Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on

Hey you patients
Where's your surgeon?
Left you with your
Insides open
With your hearts out
On the table
Gather 'round and fall right down

Feel the air now
Stumbling and wander in the moonshine
Switch opens
Opening around and let's the garden rise

Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
