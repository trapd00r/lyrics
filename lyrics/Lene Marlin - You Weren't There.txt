She came home just won the game
Long time struggle she fulfilled her dream
All she wanted was to make you proud
You weren't there

He had his birthday a few days ago
He got some presents, a big party too
And there were congratulation calls
As the years before
Not ever one from you

You weren't there
Distant far away
It's like this everyday
They see you in their heads
Wonder if you'll come
Afraid to close their eyes
And miss you once again

She cut herself on a piece of paper
It didn't hurt but she saw the blood
She could need that embrace
You weren't there

Did he have to cry louder?
Would that make you hear him?
You see his heart was broken
For the first time

You weren't there
Distant far away
It's like this everyday
They see you in their heads
Wonder if you'll come
Afraid to close their eyes
And miss you once again

Cannot turn back time
A wish yet to come true
They're making up these stories about you

You weren't there
Distant far away
It's like this everyday
They see you in their heads
Wonder if you'll come
Afraid to close their eyes
And miss you once again

And miss you once again
