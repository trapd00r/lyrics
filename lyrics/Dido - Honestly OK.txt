I just want to feel safe in my own skin
I just want to be happy again
I just want to feel deep in my own world
But I'm so lonely
I don't even want to be with myself anymore

On a different day
If I was safe in my own skin
Then I wouldn't feel lost and so frightened
But this is today
And I'm lost in my own skin
And I'm so lonely
I don't even want to be with myself anymore

And I just say oh, oh
I feel, oh, oh

And I'm so lonely
I don't even want to be with myself anymore.

I just say oh, oh
And i'm so lonely 
I feel oh, oh
I dont even want to be with myself anymore.

I just want to feel safe in my own skin
I just want to be happy again.
