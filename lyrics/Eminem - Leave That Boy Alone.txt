[Chorus: Eminem]
Y'all better leave that boy alone
'cause if they don't
You know they going come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't dare get that boy going

I said leave that boy alone
'cause y'all don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To stirr some shit up when he in that zone

[Bridge: x2]

Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
'cause you don't want to get that boy goin

[Swift]
It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I hate to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returning bows 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation I run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her mouth to gun resuscitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got you mad 'cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing
Coming here is the worse mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle I'm pulling you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again

[Chorus]

[Kon]
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb hoe punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
This nigger dying over prizes to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play deep
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinking you can't really get sleep
'cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
Well my cops won't allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a man I do my bidding and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

[Chorus]

[Kon]
Now people I live trifling I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a knew knife
And I strike people so fast people think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few height men
Been harassed by two dikes who wanted (lou pikner)
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
'cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kunive son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas get dropped once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writing these five words
Fuck you dick riding niggas count it, it's five words.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
