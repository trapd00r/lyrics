Waterboy, where you hidin'?
If you do not come
Gonna tell you mammy you

There ain't no hammer
That's on a this mountain
That ring like mine boy
That ring like mine

I'm gonna bust this rock boy
From here to the Macon
All the way to the jail boy
All the way to the jail

You Jack of diamond
You Jack of diamond
I know you of old boy
I know you of old

You rob-a my pocket
Yes, you rob my pocket
Of silver and gold boy
Of silver and gold

There ain't no sweat boy
On a this mountain
That run a like mine boy
That run like mine

I'm gonna bust this rock boy
From here to the Macon
All the way to the jail boy
All the way to the jail

Waterboy where are you hidin'
If you don't come right here
Gonna tell your pa on you
