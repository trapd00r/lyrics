Like the man in the moon, is chasing the stars,
we hold on to our dreams, no matter how far

Like the man in the moon, smiling down from the sky,
life is not what it seams, wherever we are.

The man in the moon..

(party sounds)

Like the man in the moon, is chasing the stars,
we hold on to our dreams, no matter how far

Like the man in the moon, smiling down from the sky,
life is not what it seams, wherever we are.

Man in the moon..
