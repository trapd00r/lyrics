Be happy which I really would
But I’m busy with my next pursuit
Find someone also I could
But I’m busy with my next pursuit
Look around This perfect world
It’s perfect for the mediocre souls
Look around this wonderful Who’s chasing for the big unknown

Be happy I really would
But I’m busy with my next pursuit
Ain’t no one can make me a fool
I know my gifts and all my flaws
Accept your faith so why the tears
Don’t pretend you don’t want it more
Judge me but you don’t know me at all
Break my wings you bet I would fall
