Satellite's gone
up to the sky
Things like that drive me
out of my mind

I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

Satellite of love (x2)

Satellite's gone
way up to Mars
Soon it will be filled (baby)
with parking cars

I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

Satellite of love (repeat)

Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
Monday, Tuesday, Wednessday, Friday (repeat)

Satellite's gone
up to the sky
Things like that drive me
out of my mind

I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

Satellite of love (repeat)
