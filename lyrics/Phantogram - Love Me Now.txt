Never wanted what we made
I've said all I had to say
Cause when you break your eyes off of me
I'm always caught between the devil and a screen

You love me love me love me love me now
You love me love me love me love me now

What's a loaded gun to me?
I wanna be the one to say goodnight
And if I change my style once again
I'm always caught between what you wish and what I am

You love me, love me, love me, love me now
You love me, love me, love me, love me now
You need to, need to, need to, need to break me down
You love me, love me, love me, love me now

You love me love me love me love me now
You love me love me love me love me now
Do you need to need to need to need to break me down
You love me love me love me love me now

Do you need to, need to, need to, need to break me down
