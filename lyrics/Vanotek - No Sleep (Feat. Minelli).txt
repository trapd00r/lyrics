Again where I was yesterday
Not even one step away
I think I'll go insane
I said I want another life
But I'm too weak now to fight
I'm tired of chasing after dreams

So mmm, mmm, mmm
Walk in the night
Walk in the night (alright)

I have no sleep since you walked out, out of my life
I have no sleep since you walked out
And since you walked trough the door and then left me behind
I have no sleep since you walked out

Walk in the night

A happy me is what I see
And only love is what I need
Don't wanna go insane
I said I want another life
But I'm too weak now to fight
I'm tired of chasing after dreams

So mmm, mmm, mmm
Walk in the night
Walk in the night (alright)

I have no sleep since you walked out, out of my life
I have no sleep since you walked out (megami)
And since you walked trough the door and then left me behind
I have no sleep since you walked out

Walk in the night (alright)
Walk in the night
Walk in the night
