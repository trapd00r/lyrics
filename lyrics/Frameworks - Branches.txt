Her text color coded
In the IDE with her functions folded
Elegant procedures READ THIS bolded
ChangeLog indicate versions of olden
Checking her indentations
Strings sitting neatly in quotations
And all vars stand declared
With the most efficient of vartypes shared

For the code reading impaired
She's got them comments up top in an asterisked square
Followed by a list of includes
That are setting up the frameworks initialized tools
Architecture optimized
With a modest memory footprint resized
To run under any conditions
From an R pi to a cloud of Gibsons

She's my golden girl
Ready to release to the outside world

She got a set of long legs
In the version tree where I forked new regs
But the branches expansions don't fade
Every ends tied up with their MAKEFILEs made
No bandaids cause I got a hotfix mandate
Every planned date hit every master commit committed
In the pit of GitHub where my girls submitted

And though her betas got rough at times
With a few long nights and a couple lines
Ain't a problem that we didn't get squashed
Cause her boss held it down with his Macintosh
And now she's all grown up and gorgeous
So I had to record this
Love letter to my girl gone golden
Terminated by a semicolon;

The QA is completed
I got a feeling that im missing some features
But
I guess the way I see it
I can't help it you're my golden girl
