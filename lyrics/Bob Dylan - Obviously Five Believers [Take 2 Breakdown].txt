Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to, I'm callin' you to please come home
Yes, I guess I could make it without you
If I just didn't feel so all alone

Don't let me down, don't let me down
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no I won't
You know I can if you can, honey
But, honey, please don't

I got my black dog barkin', black dog barkin'
Yes it is now, yes it is, outside my yard
Yes, I could tell you what he means
If I just didn't have to try so hard

Your mama's workin', your mama's moanin'
She's cryin' you know, she's tryin' you know, you better go now
Well, I'd tell you what she wants
If I, but I just don't know how

Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men
Tell your mama not to worry because
Yes, they're just my friends

Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to, I'm callin' you to please come home
Yes, I could make it without you
If I just didn't feel so all alone
