You broke my heart like an egg, she said 
He lust smiled as he watched it flow 
Twixt butter and a dollop of cream 
Like the chefs on that TV show

He stirred it with salt and a sprinkling of parsley 
He made it smell so good 
Her heart swirled in batter, there was no way out 
She was top of the menu - soul food

And the patrons applauded his masterpiece 
They ordered more and more 
Didn't know that her heart was the secret ingredient 
And the cat got his share from the floor 
The cat got his share from the floor

Mary oons later she hatched her own egg 
A boy child, the moon in his eyes 
She loved him like summer, autumn and spring 
And built him a loft with a view to the sky

A loft filled with teddies and fairies and light 
a skylight to see every star 
She danced with joy as she sang him to sleep 
And God nodded and smiled from afar

What wicked brew does man concoct 
And force one to the tasting 
The answer is quite simple
The proof is in the basting

Now she shows them how to break eggs 
They break eggs as she tells them N
o egg will e-r break 
Without the spell she puts upon them

No-one will hold her captive
No-one will ever dare
To show her how to break an egg
Cause they know that she's been there

What wicked brew does man concoct
And force one to the tasting
The answer is quite simple -
The proof is in the basting
