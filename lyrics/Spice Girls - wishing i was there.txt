[Busta Rhymes:]
OK
Oh, we about to get it just a lil hot and sweaty in this motherfucker (oh, baby)
Ladies, let's go
Soldiers let's go (dolls)
Let me talk to y'all and just you know
Give you a little situation. Listen (fellas)

You see this shit get hot
Every time I come through when I step up in the spot (are you ready)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick
Yes I'm on the lookout (let's dance)
Slow banging shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangster with it (oh, baby)
No tricks only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number
But make sure you call before you leave

[Pussycat Dolls:]
I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around
She's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (it's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be on with me (babe)

Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't you?
Don't you?
Don't you wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't you wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't you?
Don't you?

Fight the feeling (fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home
Let's keep it friendly (let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (you have to play fair)
See I don't care
But I know she ain't gon' wanna share

Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me, like me?
Don't you?
Don't you, baby?
Don't you?
Alright, sing
Don't you wish your girlfriend was raw like me? raw
Don't you wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Big thrills
Don't you?
Don't you?

[Busta Rhymes:]
OK, I see how it's goin' down (ah, don't you)
Seems like shorty wanna little menage pop off or something (let's go)
Well let me get straight to it
Every broad wanna watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the god almighty, looking all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my Aston Vanquish
Looking at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black and blueish
You wanna play with a player girl then play on
Strip out the Chanel
And leave the lingerie on
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Looking at you wanna break my back
You're the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum
And with the wagon hit you in the back of the Magnum
For the record, don't think it was something you did
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get so I could hit the both of y'all

[Pussycat Dolls:]
I know she loves you (I know she loves you)
I understand (I understand)
I'd probably be just as crazy about you
If you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (possibly)
Until then old friend
Your secret is safe with me

Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me, like me?
Don't you?
Don't you, baby?
Don't you?
Alright, sing
Don't you wish your girlfriend was raw like me? raw
Don't you wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Big thrills
Don't you?
Don't you?
