- We both seen eachother for over two and a half - something.
Back then, I guess I was (for you) nothing, but nothing.
Two years younger than you - ment baby...
You were hanging with cream, I was hanging with teens.
I saw you and your big guy, having it clean.
Never thougt you were gonna be mine and one day shine.
That was then, now, 99's reaching...

The story of She - giving me trouble breathing...

You were alone, sort of. You and your man.
You and a plan that, damn, didn't work. Who'd understand?
You understood that. You both had plans that hit the fan,
now you and your man split up. Your head's in the sand.
I got worried when you told me: Homie, you do it for me!
- I stayed away, though, you were on my mind, only!
Still kicked back... I couldn't deal with sneaking.

Here's a story of a She - giving me trouble breathing...

Chorous.

I'm talking bout She with a trouble mind...
Time's gonna deal with a trouble soul...
I'm living inside of your high but can't inhale...
Talking bout He with a troubled mind,
when time ain't dealing with a troubled soul...
I'm living inside of your high but can't inhale

- The fall of last year become december, I remember.
You did to; stuff ya used to do,
but you still made me fall flatter than floors,
you were sad, and I was there for your comfort, of course!
You tried to show love but something from above
kept holding you down but I still hung around.
You went through all that. I guess I thought about leavingâ€¦

â€¦but you're the She I'm talkin' about â€“ giving me trouble breathingâ€¦

- Sometimes I said that I had things on my mind,
wanted to say things but couldn't find words to put behindâ€¦
I admitted that. That was bullshit caus,
I was scared to create a fuzz just by talking about us.
Just talking that crush-thing, I'm thinkin' don't rush things,
I hush things down just to stick aroundâ€¦
- You strong woman with a hell of a past that ain't leavingâ€¦

Frustration's a she, giving me trouble breathingâ€¦

- It seems like we can't fadeâ€¦ but then againâ€¦ well,
first you went through hellâ€¦ then I went through hellâ€¦
How're you gonna be having it? Do tell!
Life inside of a mental cell is still hell!
Oh, well! I need just one of my eyes to see the stars in
your eyes, even if you have me crying!
- You know, you smile when you sleep, hard times even!
I know I love my little She giving me trouble breathing again!

Chorous.
