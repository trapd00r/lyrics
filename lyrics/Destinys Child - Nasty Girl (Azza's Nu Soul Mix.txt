Shakin' that thang know what i mean, lookin' all stinking nasty
So you look cute girl in them dukes, booty all lookin' trashy
Sleazy put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out yo house  without clothes on, I told ya
You nasty girl, you nasty you trashy
You classless girl, you sleazy you freaky
I never met a girl that does the things that you do
Change don't come your way it will come back to you
Put some clothes on girl

Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya 
These men don't want a hot female that's been around this block female,
you nasty girl

Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without no clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want a  hot female that's been around this  block female,
you nasty girl

Booty all out, tongue out her mouth, cleavage from here to Mexico
She walks wit a twist, one hand on her hip,
when she gets wit'cha she lets it go
Nasty put some clothes on, you look to' down
Nasty don't know why you, will not sit down
Heels on her feet, swear she's in heat, flirtin' wit every man she sees
Her pants hangin' low, she never says no, everyone knows she's easy
Nasty put some clothes on, you lookin' stink
Nasty wheres your pride?  You should be ashamed

You make it
Hard...for women like me who try to have some integrity
You make it hard...for girls like myself who respect themselves
And have dignity
You nasty girl, you nasty, you trashy
You classless girl, you sleazy, you freaky
N-A-S-T-Y ya nasty, F-R-E-A-K ya freaky
Girl where's your P-R-I-D-E, put some clothes on

Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without no clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want a  hot female that's been around this  block female,
you nasty girl

Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without no clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want a  hot female that's been around this  block female,
you nasty girl

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh oh (Repeat)
You so nasty girl, you so...you so nasty girl
You so nasty girl, you so...you so nasty girl
Put some clothes on girl!

Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without no clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want a  hot female that's been around this  block female,
you nasty girl
