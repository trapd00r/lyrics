[Intro - Presentatore TV]
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about 
father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
who's your daddy? 
 

[Hailie]
Daddy, what're you doing? 
 

[Eminem]
Haha 
 

[Eminem + Hailie]
Ok then! 
Everybody, listen up! 
 

[Eminem]
I'm goin to hell,
who's comin' with me? 
 

[Hailie]
Somebody, please help him!
i think my dadgone crazy! 
 

[Verso 1]
There's no mountain 
I can't climb, 
there's no tower too high, 
no plane that I can't learn 
how to fly
what do I gotta do 
to get through to you, 
to show you there ain't nothin' 
I can't take this chainsaw to?
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls,
I cut'em off, and got'em pickled 
and bronzed in a glass jar 
inside of a hall
 with my framed autographed 
sunglasses with Elton John's name on 
my drag wall, 
I'm out the closet, 
I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time me and Dre 
been fuckin' with hats off 
 

[Dr. Dre]
Suck it, Marshall!
 

So tell Laura (1) and her 
husband to back off
before I push this muthafuckin' 
button and blast off 
and launch one at these Russians 
and that's all
blow every fuckin' thing 
except Afghanistan on the map off.
When will it stop? 
When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby,
 

[Hailie]
My dad's lost it!
 

[Ritornello Eminem]
There's really nothin' else 
to say ha, i can't explain it 
 

[Hailie]
I think my dad gone crazy! 
 

[Eminem]
A little help from Hailie Jade, 
won't you tell 'em baby?
 

[Hailie]
I think my dad gone crazy! 
 

[Eminem]
There's nothin' you could do or say 
that could ever change me
 

[Hailie]
I think my dad gone crazy! 
 

[Eminem]
There's noone on earth that 
can save me, not even Hailie 
 

[Hailie]
I think my dad gone crazy! 
 

[Verso 2]
It's like my mother always told me, 
rana rana rana rana rana rana rana 
rana rana rana and codeine and
goddammit you little muthafucker 
if you ain't got nuthin' nice 
to say then don't say nuthin'
â€¦..uh, fuck that shit bitch 
eat a muthafuckin' dick, 
chew on a prick and lick a million 
muthafuckin' cocks per second, 
I'd rather put out 
a muthafuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a 
pussy whipped bitch, 
eat pussy, 
and have pussy lips glued 
to my face with a clit ring 
in my nose, then 
quit bringin' my flows
 quit givin' me my ammo. 
Can't you see 
why I'm so mean? 
If y'all leave me alone 
this wouldn't be my M.O. (2)
I wouldn't have to go, 
eenee, meenee, meini, mo,
catch a homo by his toe, 
man I don't know no more
am I the only fuckin' one 
who's normal any more?  (2a)
 

[Hailie]
Dad
 

[Ritornello]
 

[Verso 3]
My songs can make you cry, 
take you by surprise at the same time, 
can make you 
dry your eyes 
with the same rhyme
see what you're seein' 
is a genius at work, 
which to me isn't work, 
so it's easy to misinterpret it at first
cus when I speak, 
it's tongue-in-cheek (3), 
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth 
before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, 
get struck by fuckin' lightning 
twice at once and die and 
come back as Vanilla Ice's son
and walk around the rest 
of my life spit on, 
and kicked and hit 
with shit everytime I sung
like R. Kelly as soon as 
"Bump and Grind" comes on. 
More pain inside of my brain 
than the eyes of a little girl
inside of a plane 
aimed at the World Trade (4), 
standin' on Ronnie's grave (5), 
screamin' at the sky, 
till clouds gather, 
it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade (6)
and that's pretty much 
the gist of it, the parents 
are pissed but the kids love it. 
9 millimeter heater stashed 
in 2 seaters 
with meat cleavers
I don't blame you,
I wouldn't let Hailie
listen to me neither...
 

[Ritornello]
 

[Outro - Eminem]
Crazy 
 

[Hailie]
You're funny daddy!
