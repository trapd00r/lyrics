This vacancy is still vacant, a tenant's hard to find
A tenant who will understand about the owner going blind

The whole place is empty, the floors all that's left

His eyes were boarded up when the last tenant got behind
And he cannot forgive said tenant for being so unkind

The whole place is empty, the floors all that's left

This vacancy remains and prospectives are all declined
Because the owners sight was bad enough
But now he's lost his mind

The whole place is empty, the floors all that's left
