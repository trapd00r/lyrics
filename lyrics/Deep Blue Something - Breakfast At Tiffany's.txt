You'll say
We've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart

You'll say
The world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think we both kind of liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

I see you
The only one who knew me
But now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong

So what now?
It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
But so much is left undone

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think we both kind of liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

You'll say
That we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart

You'll say
The world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think we both kind of liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"
