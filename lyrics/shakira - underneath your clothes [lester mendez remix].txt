You're a song, written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong, 'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes is where I'll find them

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone, when the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory 
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl 
For being such a hey, hey, hey, hey

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true, Oh babe it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence, lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners, I'm tied up to this feel...

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes, ah wha ho oh woah
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl...
