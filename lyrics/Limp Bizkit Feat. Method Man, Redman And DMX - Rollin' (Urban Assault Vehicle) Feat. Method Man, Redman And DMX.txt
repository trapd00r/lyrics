Play the fuckin' track
Play that fuckin' track! Oh there it is...

Limp Bizkit
DMX! (what)
Redman (that's right y'all), Method Man
We just keep on Rollin' baby

Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready

Move in, now move out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now (Come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (What)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Fred Durst
Now I know y'all be lovin' this shit right here
L.I.M.P Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care
See I ain't giving a fuck, when pressing your luck
Untouchable, branded unfuckable
So keep me in this cage until you run that mouth
Then I might have to play and break the fuck out
And then we'll see who's left after one round with X
And what am I bringing next? Just know it's Red and Meth
So where the fuck you at punk?
Shut the fuck up, and back the fuck up
While we fuck this track up

Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready

Move in, now move out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now (Come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (What)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Method Man
Oh what, y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?

Check my dangerous slang, atrocious
When I let these nuts hang
Focus, it's Wu-Tang
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish
I wave my black flag at the roaches who approach us
These twin supersoakers
Who have poisonous darts for culprits
Too late to get your blowgun unholstered
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted
So what? I drink and smoke too much
So what? I cuss too much
Shut the fuck up

Redman
Now when we roll, you motherfuckers tuck in your gold
Cause for the platinum, I'm jackin' niggas up in limos
It ain't nothin' for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description: Yellow male, tissue up in his nose
You bitches, swing the vine on the baboon nuts
I'm hairy as hell, out of hell and tattooed up
I'm a dog, only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts

Method Man
My name is Johnny Donny Brasco, tuck the gat low
Cut your cash flow, yell if you want money
Funny how hungry dummies snatch crumbs from me
Dark and hot, mix bodies in the mosh pit

Redman
Yo, and I'm the D.O.; you're lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday I spit, thirty five to forty minutes
Smell up the bathroom like Craig Paul was in it
Ending up on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me, I crack 'em all a Guinness
Fuck how many thugs or playas or ballas in it
Brick city, Shaolin, better call 'em sinners
Boys that'll run up in your white mall and spill it

Yo, we said come on

Move in, now move out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now (Come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (What)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

DMX
It just don't get no darker than that kid with the parka
Bald head with the boots who shoots to make it spark
Now I'm a fair nigga, but ain't there nigga
Quicker than the hair trigger, so if you dare nigga
It'll be like your man trying to hold your brain in your head
But you'll be shitting on yourself 'cause you're already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket
I'm leaving just enough for them to stuff in a basket
A tisket, a tasket, I really need my ass kicked
My mom never let me forget that I'm a bastard
I ain't never been shit, and ain't gonna be shit
That's why I take shit, whenever I see shit
It's just that D shit, D short for do what I wanna do
And that's what I'm gonna do, right here in front of you
And I'll be running you and your man straight up out
You niggas ain't running a fuckin' thing but your mouth

Move in, now move out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now (Come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (What)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Fred Durst
You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit? (Yeah)
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (Why?)
Because we get it on (When?)
Every day and every night (Oh)
See this platinum thing right here? (Uh huh?)
Well we're doing it all the time (What?)
So you'd better get some better beats
And uh, get some better rhymes (D'oh!)
And if you really, really, really wanna get shit started
Then people everywhere just get retarded
Get retarded! Get retarded
People everywhere just get retarded

Move in, now move out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out
Hands up, now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now (Come on)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (What)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' (Uggh)
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

That's right, baby! (Watch out punk!)
Limp Bizkit
DMX! Method Man! Redman
And Swizz Beats
Where the fuck you at?
(DMX barking)
Bark that shit! x4
Ruff Ryders... punk
