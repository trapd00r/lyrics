3,5,0,1,2,5, Go!

I was there in the back stage
When first light came around
I grew up like a changeling
To win the first time around
I can see all the weakness
I can pick all the faults
Well, I concede all the faith tests
Just to stick in your throats
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g

I hung around in your soundtrack
To mirror all that you've done
To find the right side of reason
To kill the three lies for one
I can see all the cold facts
I can see through your eyes
All this talk made no contact
No matter how hard we tried
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g

I can still hear the footsteps
I can only see walls
I slid into your man-traps
With no hearing at all
I just see contradiction
Had to give up the fight
Just to live in the past tense
To make believe you were right
3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g
