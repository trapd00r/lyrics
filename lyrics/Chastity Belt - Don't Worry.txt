When I went to the show
Lineup I barely know
You asked me "How's it going?"
I pull the words from the air around me

Smaller than the cloud it formed
I'm disconnected
Touch the burner to see if it's hot
Maybe this time I'll learn my lesson

I'm feeling like an empty shell
I don't have much to say
I'm taking out a drink and
I'll ask you about your day

Smaller than the cloud it formed
I'm disconnected
Touch the burner to see if it's hot
Maybe this time I'll learn my lesson

Don't worry about me
I'm good at being what I wanna be
Don't worry about me
I'm good at being what I want

I'll find her
I'll find her
I'll find her
