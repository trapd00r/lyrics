I might as well admit it
I fell for your letters and your smile
and when you stopped smiling I stopped   hoping.
And we didn't say what we feel,
we both knew the end was close
and saying nothing is almost like lying.

The way you talk so loud
of you and you're glory days now
and I can´t even say your name
The way you talk so proud
of you and your glory days now
in my last breath I will say your name, I´ll   say your name

In my last breath I will say, I´ll say your   name.

oh, in my last breath 
you gonna make me
you gonna make me say your name.

And we spoke from the heart
and I know I played my part in it
when I said 
never ever.
I don't know why I said it
no I didn't mean it
not to be together.
together

The way you talk so loud
of you and your glory days now
and I can´t even say your name
The way you talk so proud
of you and your glory days now
in my last breath I will say your name, I´ll   say your name

oh, in my last breath you gonna make me
you gonna make    me say your name.
oh, my last words, my last words will be
There is something in your voice
there´s just something I just can´t explain
in my last breath i will say your name
your name
