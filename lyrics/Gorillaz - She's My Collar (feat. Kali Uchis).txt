2D:
If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she knows I'll call her
She's getting on the sun and that she ordered
Imagine me, imagine me now
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take a damn [?] dreading all day
I clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover (she's my collar)
Nothing to be justified in
Just one thing, you should feel nada
I know she lies, I know she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

She's my serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message never call her
And now I wanna taste another
And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar
Nothing to be justified yet
She's the first I'm running with
She's the one that gets my collar
She's the one I'm running with

She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar

Kali Uchis:
I'm yellow, he was blue
It's nothing that he could hide
We made agreement though
Whenever we were so alive
I died a thousand times
I did what I had to do
Hey, that's just how it goes
I'm still coming back to you

2D (Kali Uchis):
If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
(You, you, you)
'Cause she's standing drama, she knows I'll call her
(You, you, you, you)
She's getting on the sun and that she ordered
Imagine me, imagine me now (she's my collar)
I don't take her number just don't think I'd call her
(You, you, you)
I take a damn [?]
(You, you, you, you)
I clear my system, I don't need no other
(You, you, you)
This is my persona, secret lover (she's my collar)

2D:
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar
Oh
She's my collar
