Tryin' to let you know what it's all about
I know you wanna leave
So many little games silly people play
Don't act foolishly
I'm so real, so soft to the touch
My love my kiss so sweet, glorious
The look on your face
Anyone can see 
No one does it like me

Chorus:
Oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,
uh uh oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,
uh uh oh no
Can't nobody love you like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na na na na na no

I knew you'd be the one to come out your mouth
I need you please to relax
I know I messed up but if you leave me now
Ain't no coming back, no more no me no you
No us no kiss no hug, tell the truth
See I'm the only one that can love you babe, 
you're not that big a fool

Chorus:
Oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,
uh uh oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,
uh uh oh no
Can't nobody love you like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na na na na na no

Can't no one else but me do
Do the things that I do to you
The things I do to you
The things I do to you
Can't no one else but me do
Do the things that I do to you (the things that I do to you)
The things I do to you

Chorus:
Oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,
uh uh oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,
uh uh oh no
Can't nobody love you like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na na na na na no

They can't do it like me
They can't love you like me
They can't treat you like me
They can't do it like me

and get right down to it like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,
uh uh oh no
Can't nobody love you like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na na na na na no

Hey!

Na na na na na na na no

Chorus:
Oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me,

Can't nobody do it like me

Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh and get right down to it like me

Can't nobody do it like me,

Can't nobody love you like me
oh no, oh no
Can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, na na na na na na na no (until fade)
