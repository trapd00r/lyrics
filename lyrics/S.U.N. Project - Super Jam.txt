I took my baby on a Saturday bang
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
Yes, we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
And it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Don't look at that

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean

[L.T.B.:]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Michael Jackson:]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' about my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright
Alright
Alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Alright
Alright
Schamo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Alright

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, woo

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, woo
