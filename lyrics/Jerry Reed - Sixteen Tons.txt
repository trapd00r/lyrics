Son yeah some people say a man's made outta mud
But a poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood skin and bone a mind
That's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons what do you get
Another day older and deeper and debt
St Peter don't you call me I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I owe my soul I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
Grabbed me a shovel and I went to the mine
Loaded sicteen tons of No 9 coal
And the storeboss said well bless my soul

I load sixteen tons what do you get...

[ guitar ]
 Well I was born one morning it was drizzlin' rain
Figting and trouble is my middle name
I was raised in wood by mama of mine
No hightoned mama makes me walk the line

I load sixteen tons what do you get...

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't and a lotta men died
One fist is iron the other one's steel
If the right one don't get you then the left one will

I load sixteen tons what do you get...
