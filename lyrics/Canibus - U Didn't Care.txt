What up Em? It's your biggest fan
It's not even necessary to introduce who I am by now 'cause we're good friends
Remember the letter I wrote before Atlanta on "Up In Smoke"?
That's the day I was going to cut your throat
I guess my watch is broke, 'cause by the time I woke
I seen my watch was twelve hours late and I missed the show
But none the less I'm glad that I finally reached you
Ever since the accident I've been dying to speak to you
To tell you things have changed and I'm a different man
A different level of understanding, I'm a different Stan
Things are a lot better, I promise I won't harass you with any letters
Saying shit like we should be together
I meant we should start a group
The industry's full of homosexuals Slim, but I don't want to fuck you
I've got a new attitude, really, I'm ain't mad at you
I just wanted you to recognize that I've got talent too

When I say talented, I don't mean battle, kid
I mean story telling kind of like how your album is
I've been attending counselling and taking medicine
They did some tests on me at N.I.H. in Maryland
They showed me techniques to help me deal with pressure
Whenever I remember that crazy night when I was being reckless
Driving with a death-wish on the bridge
I crashed into a Lexus right before I finished that last sentence
I was listening to Xzibit's album "Restless"
The next thing I knew I was underwater and breathless
I was unconscious for a second literally dying to go to Heaven
Until some fellas came and pulled me from the wreckage
They started CPR then they called the paramedics
In retrospect I probably should have used a gun to end it
By the time the car had sunk my pregnant girlfriend was still in the trunk
And I was still feeling kind of drunk
The ambulance came and they put me on the stretcher
Hooked me up to the IV and checked my blood pressure
One of them was so concerned that they wouldn't leave
He hoped in the back of the ambulance and rolled up some weed
My vision was blurry I couldn't really see
I just remember his voice talking to me
In the emergency room, I needed surgery to get some glass removed
And fifty stitches for my wounds

After a couple of months of therapy
I figured I was as ready as I'd ever be, I wanted to be an MC
He took me to shows with him, he let me flow with him
He let me write some rhymes and go on tour with him
I really believed in him, I decided to team with him
And now I'm overseas with him, getting G's with him
And I'm emceeing with him, I'm having the best time of my life
And I'm writing the best rhymes of my life
He introduces me to people as his lyrical equal
Let me write a rhyme on his album and even produce a beat too
He ain't see through, I can't see him fronting
He's not the type to call you just because he needs something
That's what I like about him, I wouldn't want to rock a mic' without him
He's got cajones and he's not a coward
Matter of fact, I think he met you
It was the day you came to his video shoot with DJ, Jimmy's nephew
Clef stepped to him and told him he should step to you
That you was ghost-writing for 'L' but that wasn't true
You was looking at him the same way I'm looking at you
Why can't we be friends 'Em, I don't want nothing from you
You see, there's a little bit of Stan in all of us
Tell me where you think all of these record sales spawned from
Talking about Britney and Christina Aguilera
NSYNC too, have you ever looked in the mirror
Your hair ain't really blonde and your eyes ain't blue
So never diss me 'cause when you diss me you're dissing you

You see? You see what happens when you don't care?
