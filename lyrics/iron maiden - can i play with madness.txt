Can I play with madness?

Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me

Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gotta break down the walls, break out of this bad place

Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all

Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked and he laughed at me, ha, he said
Can I play with madness?
He said, "You're blind, too blind to see."

Oh, said you're too blind to see, mmm

I screamed aloud to the old man
I said, "Don't lie and don't say you don't know.
I say you'll pay for this mischief
Oh, in this world or the next."

Oh, then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hellfires raged in his eyes
He said, "You want to know the truth son, Lord I'll tell you the truth.
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire."
