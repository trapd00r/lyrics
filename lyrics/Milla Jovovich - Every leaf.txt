Why you bleeding?
I'm on my knees again
Days are breezing by
But we're not seeing them
Thoughts of what will be
Crushed by what is
Lines of children
Standing fearless
Memories of a
Future wrapped in shroud
Cold hard sun ripping
Through the warm dark clouds

-I can't find you
I can't leave off
Looking under
Every leaf-

Fragrant blooms dressed
Up in sunshine
I place them fresh here
Beside your bed
I know you trembled
I know it sweetheart
Don't worry now baby
Don't worry now
That it's all said and done

-I can't find you
And I can't leave off
Looking under
Every leaf-

Tonight I'll be somebody's girl
Let me be your little girl
