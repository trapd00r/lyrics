'Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Mary J. is in the spot tonight
And I'mma make it feel alright
(Make it feel alright)

Come on, baby, just party with me
Let loose and set your body free
Leave your situations at the door
So when you step inside jump on the floor

Let's get it crunk up on

Before you get loose and start to lose your mind
Cop you a drink, go 'head and rock your ice
'Cause we're celebrating no more drama in our life

With the Dre track pumpin'
Everybody's jumpin'
Go ahead and twist your back
And get your body bumpin'
I told you leave your situations at the door
So grab somebody and get your ass on the dance floor

We just want y'all have a good time
No more drama in your life
Work real hard to make a dime
If you got beef, your problem, not mine

Leave all that BS outside
We're gonna celebrate all night
Let's have fun tonight, no fights
Turn that Dre track way up high

Making you dance all night and I
Got some real heat for you this time
It doesn't matter if you're white or black
Let's get crunk 'cause Mary's back
