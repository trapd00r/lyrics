Like rusty old nails at the bottom of the sea
Telling no tales, for the good of the admiralty
You jump when you're told to through the open door
And the King of Norway, he's the man you all died for

On this, Jacob's ladder
The only way up is down
Three days in the water
Watching all the secrets drown
Jacob's ladder

And they sent him to the wars to be slain, to be slain
And they sent him to the wars to be slain

A thousand lifetimes, left standing at the docks
In the bar down in Whitehall, they're sure the boat won't rock
In a file marked secret's in a drawer kept closed
Nobody wonders because nobody knows

On this Jacob's ladder
The only way up is down
Three days in the water
Watching all the secrets drown
Jacob's ladder

And they sent him to the wars to be slain, to be slain
And they sent him to the wars to be slain

And they sent him to the wars to be slain, to be slain
And they sent him to the wars to be slain
And they sent him to the wars to be slain, to be slain
And they sent him to the wars to be slain

On this Jacob's ladder
The only way up is down
Three days in the water
Watching all the secrets drown

On this Jacob's ladder
The only way up is down
Three days in the water
Watching all the secrets drown
Jacob's ladder

Sooner or later
We'll dig up the body and try your cadaver
Sooner or later
We'll dig up the body and try your cadaver
Sooner or later

Jacob's ladder
