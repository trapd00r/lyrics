RAP: 
Let's go. So bring your passport, girl.
I'm trying to show you the world.
I know your ex did you bad,
But I'm your new perfect man.
Dignity where you stand.
With just a touch of my hand.
I'm trying to show you my plan.
You got me, girl. I'm a fan.

From the minute that you walked right through the door,
Thoughts were racing in my mind, time to explore.
I tell my friends that I just gotta have him.
But don't look now, 'cuz I see you staring at him.
Tunnel vision had him locked on in my sight.
On a mission for position by the end of the night.
It's like a prey playing games with the hunter
Nowhere to run, boy, time to surrender.

And all I need is to feel you.
All I want is to feel you.

(Reach out and touch me)
Before I go insane
(Reach out and touch me)
Boy don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money.
(Reach out and touch me)

And all I need is to feel you.
(Reach Out and touch me)

Like a prayer, your touch can take me there.
In my mind, you and me, in a secret affair.
Oh, boy you're killing me and you don't even know it.
Tried to hold back, but I can't control it.
So I'm stepping to ya.
Skip the "How ya doin'?"
Grab your hand, pull you closer to me, yea.
Out the door we're slipping.
Then we start to kissing.
Boy you're invited to my fanta-tasy.

And all I need is to feel you.
All I want is to feel you.

(Reach out and touch me) [reach out]
Before I go insane [touch me baby]
(Reach out and touch me)
Boy don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money.
(Reach out and touch me) [reach out and touch me]
(Reach out and touch me) ah ah-a go ah go
(Reach out and touch me) ah ah-a go ah go
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money
Reach out and touch me

And all I need {Yea} is to feel you. {you already know}
(Reach out and touch me) {It's Prophet, baby ah! ah!}

RAP:
Let's Go!
I'm here to play with fire.
Your body's my desire.
The time to flirt across the room doesn't expire.
'Cuz you a superstar.
Get in my supercar.
The paparazzi watchin' us the t-t-tube is on.
I know I took it far, but look how good you are.
And look how good you look.
One touch, I'm supercharged.

Baby, can't you see how you're affecting me?
Baby, sensual, physical fantasy.
Maybe fate brought the two of us close and now,
Don't you wanna
Don't you wanna
Don't you wanna
Don't you wanna
(Reach out and touch me) [yea]

(Reach out and touch me) [reach out]
Before I go insane [touch me baby]
(Reach out and touch me)
Boy don't you make me wait
I'm a dime and you're so on the money.
(Reach out and touch me) [reach out and touch me]
(Reach out and touch me) ah ah-a go ah go
(Reach out and touch me) ah ah-a go ah go
I'm a diamond and you're so on the money
(Reach out and touch me)

And all I need is to feel you.
(Reach out and touch me)

Reach out... reach out... reach out
[fade out]
Reach out... reach out...
(Reach Out and Touch Me)...
