(Ohh ohh)

Just a little more to show for
I've been down and out by myself
Selfish and alone and all
Sitting in my room, feeling blue
Waiting for someone to call
I'm such a fool for love
I'm such a girl sometimes
Thinking love is gonna come my way
(Love is gonna come my way)
I'm so 16 sometimes, oh sometimes

Some girls just got
Just a little more to show for
Some girls just got
What it takes to make it
What if I'm not?
What if everything just falls down?
What if everything just falls down?

I've been down and out for too long
Think I'm gonna lose my mind
Talking to myself in my sleep
Waiting for some stupid sign
I'm such a fool for love
I'm such a girl sometimes
Thinking love is gonna come my way
(Love is gonna come my way)
I'm so 16 sometimes, oh sometimes

Some girls just got
Just a little more to show for
Some girls just got
What it takes to make it
What if I'm not?
What if everything just falls down?
What if everything just falls down?

Sometimes I feel beautiful
Sometimes I just know I will be fine
Oh, I feel beautiful
Oohh (laughing!)

Yeah, heh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oohh, oohh
Yeah, yeah

Such a fool for love
I'm such a fool for love
I'm such a girl sometimes
Thinking love is gonna come my way
(Love is gonna come my way)
I'm so 16 sometimes, oh sometimes

Some girls just got
Just a little more to show for
Some girls just got
What it takes to make it
What if I'm not?
What if everything just falls down?

Just a little more to show for
Some girls just got
Just a little more to show for
Some girls just got
What it takes to make it
What if I'm not?
What if everything just falls down?
What if everything just falls down?
