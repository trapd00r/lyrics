If I'm gonna rob I'm a rob all night
If I'm looking for somthin its probly a fight

Wont you run when you see X
Pull out and run when you see text
Blaow the light is what you see next 
Fuck who you listenin too I'm the baddest

Stupid little niggas don't want no static
When they say who shot JR it wont be Dallas

Bring all you got to even the score 
These bombs is hot you want more 
Really don't know what you askin for

We all dogs over here don't act like a cat
Be like untouchables round table with a bat
Stop lift a chair and crack crack crack
