I'm tired of sleeping on us
I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just to text you back
So you don't get to thinkin' that I'm too attached
I'm more than benefit friends
I'm more than just a weekend binge
I want you to be my hottie riding shottie, I don't want nobody's body but your body, babe
All I'm tryna say is

There's a difference between "miss ya" and "I miss your face"
And there's a difference in "What's going on?" and "Baby, how was your day?"
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
And there's a difference in "Love ya" and "I love you"
And I wanna be the difference, yeah I do

I wanna be the difference between "Hey, what's up?' and "What are we gonna do tonight?"
Between "Yeah, she's cool, we hang out sometimes" and "That girl right there, she's mine"
Between leading ya on and holdin' your hand
Sittin' it out and "Girl, let's dance"
Between playing it safe and taking the chance
Yeah, pumpin' the brakes and hittin' the gas

There's a difference between "miss ya" and "I miss your face"
And there's a difference in "What's going on?" and "Baby, how was your day?"
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
And there's a difference in "Love ya" and "I love you"

And I wanna be the difference, close the distance
And be that puzzle piece you didn't even know you was missing baby
Ohh, I wanna be the difference, yeah I do

There's a difference between "miss ya" and "I miss your face"
And there's a difference in "What's going on?" and "Baby, how was your day?"
Yeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two
And there's a difference in "Love ya" and "I love you"
And I wanna be the difference, oh yeah
I wanna be the difference
I wanna be the difference
