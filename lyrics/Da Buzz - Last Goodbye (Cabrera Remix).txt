Last goodbye, last goodbye
Last goodbye, last goodbye

You gave me a home
Somewhere to rest my mind
But one day I left
After a stupid fight
What couldn't I see, all the good things behind?
Now I stand in the truth, I suddenly realize

This is my last goodbye
'Cause I need you so
My last goodbye
No wonder why
You give life a meaning, you fill me with hope
A world full of reasons
That's why I call it my last goodbye

You're wherever I go, wherever I put my feet
I'm faithful to all, all that I still have to bear
Why couldn't I see all the good things behind?
Now I stand in the truth, I suddenly realize...

This is my last goodbye 'cause I need you so
My last goodbye, no wonder why
You give life a meaning, you fill me with hope
A world full of reasons
That's why I call it my last goodbye

Last goodbye, my last goodbye, last goodbye

I don't wanna hear it
Don't ever tell me it's over
I just wanna say I know our love is stronger
And I'm back to make it all right
There's no more goodbye

This is my last goodbye 'cause I need you so
My last goodbye, no wonder why
You give life a meaning, you fill me with hope
A world full of reasons
That's why I call it my last goodbye
