I started reeking of the people I was with
I have no secret, I was freaking out a bit
I took a chopper 'cause I grew up with a lot of changes
I am alone a lot, I see this as my weakness
I am embarrassed of my solo, I don't know why
I don't want people to know how much time I spend alone
Time I spend alone, time I spend alone, time I spend alone

When I take you on, I try
When I take you on, I try
When I take you on
When I take you on, I try

I put up cinderblocks to take away the pain
I separated from society today
I don't get close to anybody but my feelings
I cannot think when I am reeling
I think of people that I used to see who don't like me
I don't want people to know how much time I spend alone
Time I spend alone, time I spend alone, time I spend alone

When I take you on, I try
When I take you on, I try
When I take you on
When I take you on, I try

When I take you on
When I take you on
When I take you on
When I take you on
When I take you on
When I take you on
When I take you on
When I take you on
