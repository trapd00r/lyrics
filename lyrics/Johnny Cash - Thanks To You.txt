I sat at home Friday last
Waitin' for your call
Thinkin' as the hours passed
Were you worth it all
As the tears began to fill my head
It's then I thought to write instead
A hit song full a heartache I'm gettin' the applause And all the pain you caused
Credit must go where credit is due
So I tip my hat and toast to you
For all the hits songs full a heartache
Now days go by and weeks will pass
With not a word from you
I don't mind when people ask
How's you know who?
'Cause when the tears begin to fill my head
It's then I start to write instead
Another hit song full a heartache
Thanks to You
