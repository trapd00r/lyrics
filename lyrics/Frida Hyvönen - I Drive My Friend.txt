I drive my friend to the station
It's the second day of june
Wearing white thin leather gloves
And a heady headache from last night
Now, you do the talking and i'll keep us on the road
I am transporting a treasure here
And i'm making sure that he gets home
The sun is shining
I have everything
The strenght to see him off
With no promise of his return
Turn turn turn
Turn turn turn
Turn turn turn

Last night we were drinking in a tiny bar
Suddenly you kissed me
I'd never felt so good before
Now, i'd never claim you but i'll want you 'til i'm gone
Want you to walk straight through and
Want you to be more and more
The clouds aren't crying - they look down on me
Who'd wait a million years for your return
Turn turn turn
Turn turn turn
Turn turn turn

I drive you down to the station
It's a lazy summer's day
I've got no extraordinary cards in my hand
No words or actions to make you stay
You like to be up north and i like it down here
And love isn't it just like air
You breathe it and it's everywhere
The sun is shining
I have everything
A driver's licence, a car and a song to sing
Sing sing sing
Sing sing sing
Sing
