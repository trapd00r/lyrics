All my life I have searched for clues 
This is what they taught me 
Every mystery I pursued 
Was a secret I already knew 
Deep down you know - in your soul 
Love is in control 
Oh - if you could find the angel within 
Time - time to have faith in your wings 

Free everybody's free 
In the new day that's coming 
Freedom for all - is our destiny - yeahh

Every stone that I left unturned 
Soon came back to haunt me 
Every fall, every finger burned 
Was a step on the road to the truth 
That I am you - in my soul 
You are not alone 
Oh - when your heart is turned to stone 
Love - love is the only way home 

Free everyone's free 
In the new day that's coming 
Freedom for all - is our destiny 

Free everything's free 
In the new day that's coming 
Freedom for all - is our destiny - destiny

Free everyone's free 
In the new day that's coming 
Freedom for all - is our destiny 

Free everything's free 
In the new day that's coming 
Freedom for all - is our destiny - destiny

Freedom for shame 
Freedom from fear 
Freedom to live - it's your right to be here 

In the new day that's coming 
Freedom for all - is our destiny - destiny - yeahh
