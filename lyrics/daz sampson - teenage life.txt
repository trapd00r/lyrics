Now hear this

"What did you learn at school today?"
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying "Just be nice, always think twice"
When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

"What did you learn at school today?"
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying "Just be nice, always think twice"
When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

Dwelling on the past, from back when I was young
Thinking of my school days and trying to write this song
Classroom schemes and dreams
Man they couldn't save me
Cos my days were numbered when I signed down on Avy
Teenage kicks running out what could we do
I still show respect to my boys who made it through
And getting told off Mr T how my life would be
Then giving him a signal
So everyone could see
Sunshine and shade
Those girls I'd serenade
Thinking of those sixth form chicks that misbehave
Hoping that those days would go on and on forever
Every day something new
Just friends running together
But suddenly school ends
Your teenage life's gone
All your mates are growing up now
They're moving on
And now I'm looking back
I'll tell you what I know
Do you listen to your teacher?
No I don't think so

"What did you learn at school today?"
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand
Do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying "Just be nice, always think twice"
When it's been a long since they had a teenage life

Now if you treat the kids fine, together they will shine
Ooh ooh ooh shine
And if you give the kids time, they won't do the crime
Won't do the crime

Now my bad old ways
Were during my school days
Messing on those grade A's
My life is just a haze
I'm going through the struggle
Five ten and kicking back
So I could lock my flow
Lace it up now on the track
Oh yeh I felt the pain
Whilst chasing all the fame
I'm being told I'm nothing
Just a player in the game
But now I walk tall
Stand proud for you to see
I'm driving these fast cars
It's five stars for me

"What did you learn at school today?"
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying "Just be nice, always think twice"
When it's been a long since they had a teenage life
