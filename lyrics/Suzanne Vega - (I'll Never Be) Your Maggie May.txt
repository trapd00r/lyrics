I'll never be your Maggie May 
The one you loved and left behind 
The face you see in light of day 
Then you cast away 
That isn't me in that bed you'll find 

I'd rather take myself away 
Be like those ladies in Japan 
Rather paint myself a face 
Conjure up some grace 
Or be the eyes behind a fan 

And so you go 
No girl could say no 
To you 

Oh, there's the way I may appear 
But that will change from day to night 
Would you ever see within? 
Underneath the skin? 
Could I believe you had that sight? 


And so you go 
No girl could say no 
To you 

I'll never be your Maggie May 
The one you loved and then forgot 
I'll love you first and let you go 
Because it must be so 
And you'll forgive or you will not 

And so a woman leaves a man 
And so a world turns on it's end 
So I'll see your face in dreams 
Where nothing's what it seems 
Still you appear some kind of friend 

And so you go 
No girl could say no 
To you
