When this life ends
And I'll be silent
I'll think of you for a while
And I'll go out with a smile
Remember that day when you caught me singing
And I was yours for a while
I shall go out with a smile

Sing me to sleep, Elina
When there's nothing left to see
And although we're all in a line-up
It is always you and me

When this world falls
We ran out of walls
The day that we get to be united with the sea
Times of forsaking
My mind is aching
You let me rest for a while
I am safe by your side

Sing me to sleep, Elina
When there's nothing left to see
And although we're all in a line-up
It is always you and me

Sing me to sleep, Elina
When there's nothing left to see
And although we're all in a line-up
You've brought so much life to me
