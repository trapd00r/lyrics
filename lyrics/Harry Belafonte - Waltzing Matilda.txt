Once a jolly Swagman, camped by a Billabong
Under the shade of a Coolibah tree
And he sang as he watched and waited till his Billy boiled
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he sat and waited till his Billy boiled
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Down came a Jumbuck to drink at that Billabong
Up jumped the Swagman and grabbed him with glee
And he sang as he shoved that Jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he shoved that Jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Up rode the squatter mounted on his thoroughbred
Down come the troopers, one, two, three
Whose that jolly Jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
Whose that jolly Jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Up jumped the Swagman, sprang into the Billabong
Drowning himself by the Coolibah tree
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that Billabong
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that Billabong
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
