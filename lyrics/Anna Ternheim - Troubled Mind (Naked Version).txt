Found love, last summer it faded away
All marks on my body vanished in a day
Unwanted, late September when you are eager to find
Wait to last winter, love of any kind

You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind

All winter, slept around until my heart fell a sleep
Never had so much, was afraid to keep
First of April, love of your life falls out of the blue
Falling for a bad joke, you love to be the fool

You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind

So find love, for to night for all nights to come
As long as you're with someone and never left alone
As long as you're with someone never left alone

You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
