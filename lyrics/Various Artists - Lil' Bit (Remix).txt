[Intro : Price ]
All I need is just a little bit
All I need is a little bit
All I want is a little bit
I just gotta have a little bit
B-O-Dub need a little bit
We The Plug need a little bit
HS need a little bit
Good Vibe Tribe need a little bit

[Verse 1 : Price]
Alright I drink a little bit
And smoke a lot of bit
5'9, nappy head with a whole lot of dick
I smoke by the zip just to build my tolerance
My homie got chip they hit the hood of politic
How the shit
They talking war but they not equipped
You f'sho not a thug, you f'sho gotta quit
You f'sho not a Blood, you f'sho not a Crip
I look at you and I just see a whole lotta bitch
I don't know if it's the food or it's the water you drinkin'
But if they showboat I'll be the water sinkin'
You with this shit just for the summer, you just hard for a season
My mama knew I was a star the moment I started breathin'
You see my father was missin', I hardly was trippin
She went hard with religion
I hardly would listen
Cause I knew something was missing
With that it always rewritten
But it ain't stop me from movin' digits like lottery tickets
Hold up
My bad, what I'm gettin' all spiritual for?
Do it on my own and do it like no one did it before
Knowin me I probably cut my own umbilical cord
You gon' feel it now if you ain't never feel it before
And I can bet that
Made me a pallet where the bank at ?
The Tribe shinin' like eight lamps
Send that emoji with the eggplant, get her wet, damn
Big guns at the house call that bitch the K-Camp
Make it chill a little bit
Relax a little bit
Fall back a little bit
Cause you could get fucked up
I'm pulled up with my clique
I'm trynna get lit not worry about shit
So don't you get it fucked up
But we doin' nothin' tryna have a good time
Tryna change my life and focus on all them good vibes
Two bestfriends, nice titties, thick thighs
Both tryna lick Price man the pleasure's all mine
Let go, Let go, Let go
Let go, Let go, L-Let go
Say what you doin'
Chill a little bit
Relax a little bit
Fall back a little bit
Cause you could get it fucked up
I'm pulled up with my clique
I'm trynna get lit no worry about shit
So don't you get it fucked up

[Verse 2 : Oktane]
Look
Wassup how you doin' ?
How is it goin' ? How you feel ?
I'm Oktane a nigga that don't know just how to chill
I don't really like this beat I gotta keep it real
But I ain’t met a beat a nigga can’t kill
So Price called me up and then I said "I'm on the way"
I do this for the free my nigga they ain't gotta pay
I treat it like an enemy and kill it right away
Recorded and shot the video the same day
Yeah I smoke a little bit, skate a little bit yeah
You watch a little bit, hate a little bit yeah
And when we face to face you never say the shit yeah
And this is exactly how a real one explain a bitch yeah
And half the people talkin' ain't about it my nigga
And you know the brokest niggas is the loudest my nigga
So I keep it quiet whenever it's crowed cause
My G's move in silence we don't want it to get rowdy my nigga
And I ain't even wanna talk that killa shit
Cause I'm a lion and my niggas go gorilla quick
It's Mister 'Wake-Up-In-The-Club, Smoke-A-Lotta-Weed'
Pour himself a drink, two step and never spill a drip
The squad stay ready and we still equipped
Price is on his peace but he still a Crip
So don't test me, my squad LSD
You get slick with your tongue and we really trip
But I came to smoke a little bit
Drink a little bit
Might take a nigga chick and he might get lumped up
Mad that I'm the shit, his chick know I'm legit
Plus I'm pourin' what she sip so she might get fucked up
Blame it on the liquor, tell'em I'm that nigga
She gon' take it how she want it if I let her take a picture
And you gon' blow her phone number she post it on her Insta
So do not switch your tone up and I will not take all your misses
Don't tell me how to play you ain't been in my position
You ain't even good enough to be a nigga opposition
And you don't even know how to begin with my precision
Bunch of rappers talkin' foo' before they got a pot to piss in
Lemme stop, half of you niggas don't even get it
The other half is goin' crazy see we really spit it
And now I'm over this, a nigga too ferocious
My flow is headed to the car and my nigga I'm leaving with it
Bitch I'm gone!
