They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released.

Yondah stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
Every night I hear him crying out so loud
Crying 'cause he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released.

They say ev'rything can be replaced
Yet ev'ry distance is not near
So I remember ev'ry damn face
Of ev'ry bastard who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released.
