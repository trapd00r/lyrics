It's the same old situation, it seems it's coming 'round again
I won't play the fool, I'm not screwin' around
I only play to win
I only want what I deserve so who are you tryin' to kid
You can call it like you see it but I call it like it is

I'm sick of shruggin' off your petty little ways
The names are always changing, in the end it's just a game
We're runnin' in a circle
A never ending chase
You keep on steppin' out of reach but you won't win the race

No more waitin' around
No more hangin' around
No more draggin' me down
No more, no more

Everything's so easy for you but I've struggled to get this far
I'm alone in the fight
What's wrong, whose right
I take it all to heart
Your true colors start to show
You call yourself a friend? The teams are drawn
You chose your side, you'll get yours in the end
You play along to the same old song just as long as you can win
When someone better comes along, you're too cool to let them in
So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you
I'd like to tell you different but I can't because it's true

No more waitin' around
No more hangin' around
No more draggin' me down
No more, no more

So now I've got you wonderin' if I've got it in for you
I'd like to tell you different but I can't because it's true

Your name here
