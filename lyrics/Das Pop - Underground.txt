I really have to let you know
The time has come for me to go
I've seen it all, there's nothing left to say
It's not about the job you quit
The boy you're with, the girl you live with
The time spent with a half-wit
It's not about the things you've said
Or the things you told me in my bed
The promise of magic

I'm going underground
Will you let me know when you're going outta town?
And will you take me down
To the here and now

You knew just what to do to me
The things you learned in Germany
The time when I was just a plaything(?)
Now I am going underground
I'm undercover as of now
I follow your shadow

I'm going underground
Will you let me know when you're going outta town?
And will you take me down
To the here and now

Knock away holes in the ceiling
To bathe in the light of the morning
I'm going underground

And it may be hard to understand
The moment my aching hands
The moment

I'm going underground
Will you let me know when you're going outta town?
And will you take me down
To the here and now
I will show you how

I'm going underground
Will you let me know when you're going outta town?
And will you take me down
To the here and now

I'm going underground
Will you let me know when you're going outta town?
And will you take me down
To the here and now
