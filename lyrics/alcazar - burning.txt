You're baby's goin' out
But she doesn't wanna go with you
When the beat is loud
Then she wants to dance with someone new
She moves with the disco nation

But youuuuu shouldn't lay the blame
Don't point your hand in our direction
Youuuuu-u-u shouldn't play the saint
We always rocked your party

We didn't start the fire
It was always burning since the world's been turning
No, we didn't start the fire (We didn't start the fire)
No, we didn't light it but we tried to fight it

Oh-wah, oh-wah
Oh-wah, oh-wah

When your baby's on the move
Don't you blame it on the melody?
Hmm, hmm
It's just another groove
Bein' laid out for the dancin' feet
By this Alcazar DJ

So youuuuu shouldn't lay the blame
Don't point your hand in our direction
Youuuuu-u-u shouldn't play the saint (Yeah, ya groove)
We always rocked your party (heyyyyy)

We didn't start the fire (yeah, yeah)
It was always burning since the world's been turning
No, we didn't start the fire (We didn't start the fire)
No, we didn't light it but we tried to fight it (whoo!)

Oh-wah, oh-wah
Oh-wah, oh-wah
(Woohooh, ooh-ooh)
Oh-wah, oh-wah
Oh-wah, oh-wah

Ev'rybody's dreamin'
Ev'rybody's screamin'
Ev'rybody's steamin' on the night train, night train
Ev'rybody's swayin' (ah-ah, yeah)
Ev'rybody's yeah-in'
Ev'rybody's playin' on the love game, love game

Youuuuu shouldn't lay the blame
Don't point your hand in our direction
Youuuuu-u-u shouldn't play the saint
We always rocked your party (Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey-hey!)
(We didnÂ´t start the fire)
