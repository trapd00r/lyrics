Getaway (repeats in the background)
I've been watching you (repeats)

Baby love
I need your love
I want to turn it up
But the world keeps on turning

My heart is real
Tell me what you feel
But as you can feel
There is a truth that is yearning

I've been watching you, do you feel it too
I've been wanting to, see what you can do
I've been watching you, do you want me
Lets stand back and make a getaway
Getaway

Baby... getaway
Getaway

Baby love
Do I ask too much?
Are you strong enough?
To feel the flame that's burning

Time, time, time
Don't let it get away
Time, time, time,
Don't let it runaway
Time, time, time
Don't let it get away

Getaway (repeat)

Baby love
Getaway
I need your love
Getaway

Getaway (repeat)
