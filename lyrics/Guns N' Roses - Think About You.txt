I said baby you been lookin' real good 
You know that I remember when we met 
Funny how I never felt so good 
It's a feelin' that I know 
I know I'll never forget 

Ooh, it was the best time I can remember 
Ooh, and the love we shared
Is lovin' that'll last forever 

There wasn't much in this heart of mine 
There was a little left and babe, you found it 
It's funny how I never felt so high 
It's a feelin' that I know 
I know I'll never forget

Ooh, it was the best time I can remember 
Ooh, and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever 

I think about you 
Honey all the time, my heart says yes 
I think about you 
Deep inside I love you best 
I think about you 
You know you're the one I want 
I think about you 
Darling you're the only one 
I think about you, yeah
Ha, ha, ha

I think about you, you know that I do
I think about you, all alone, only you
I think about you, oh, it's true
I think about you, oh, yes I do

Somethin' changed in this heart of mine
You know that I'm so glad that ya showed me

Ooh, it was the best time I can remember
Ooh, and the love we shared
Is lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you 
Honey all the time, my heart says yes 
I think about you 
Deep inside I love you best 
I think about you 
You know you're the one I want 
I think about you 
Darling you're the only one 

I think about you

I think about you, only you
I think about you, you know I do
