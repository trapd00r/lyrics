(Treat him like a lady)

Uh-huh
Uh-huh

I like chocolate and controversy
He likes fridays and bad company
I like midnight, it's when I'm in the mood
But he likes the morning, that's when he's rude

Just a bad case of opposite sex
Have to look to the stars
All we need is a little respect
'Cause men are from Venus
And girls are from mars

Bag it up don't drop the baby
Boot him out no buts or maybe
Wind him up and make him crazy
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Take him back don't drop the baby
Spin him out no buts or maybe
Do your thing come on lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lady

I don't take sugar on my colour TV
Yet he likes it loaded with eye candy
I need some space, and he needs a room
But then he keeps me waiting
By leaving too soon.

Just a bad case of opposite sex
Have to look to the stars
All we need is a little respect
'Cause men are from Venus ans girls are from mars

(Uh, yeah)
(Uh, yeah)

Treat him like a lady
Treat him like a lady,
Tease him, please me, chase me yeah.

Just a bad case of opposite sex
Have to look to the stars
All we need is a little respect
'Cause men are from Venus and girls are from mars

Treat him like a lady (bag it up)
Treat him like a lady (bag it up)
Treat him like a lady (bag it up)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Treat him like a lady (bag it up)
Sweet him like a lady (bag it up)
Treat him like a lady (bag it up)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You know what to do now,
You're in control who's wearing the trousers now?
