It's enough to make a fit man sick
Queuing up around in '46 they'll see
but that's enough about me
crackdown another one at '69
beach sand covers up another land mine, oh no.

but that's enough about you
yeah that's enough about you
take all of everything 'til I'm all black
this spell you've put me under's made me crack

backdown another one in seven six
they found out where you got your kicks
but they still thought that punk was dead
we played a secret song to them
and hoped that they'd forget
It's enough to make a fit man sick
Queuing up around in '46, oh no

but that's enough about you
yeah that's enough about you
take all of everything 'til I'm all black
this spell you've put me under's made me crack
broke another leg again
I'm broke and on the mend again
what else can i say?

and the beat of her drum plays on forever
like a belle out ringing from the south
i could leave it here, i could leave you never
i can hear you begging in the crowd
begging in the crowd

but that's enough about you
yeah that's enough about you
take all of everything 'til I'm all black
this hell you've dragged me into's made me crack
i broke another leg again
im broke and on the mend again
what else can i say?
what else can i say?
