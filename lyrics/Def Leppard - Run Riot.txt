Ah
Living by the law is a bloody necessary bore
Everybody are you gettin' what you're lookin' for?
Livin' by the rule is somethin' that you gotta do!
But does it matter if we
(Break a rule or two?)

Get up, break out, don't be the odd one out
Livin' on the edge, I'm a tryin' to keep a level head

Ev'ry morning it's a bummer gettin' out of bed
Same old story does a nothin' ever ever change?
Yeah, they lock me up and then they let me out again

Get up! - Break out!
Don't be the odd one out
C'mon, it's alright we're hot tonight

You better run - Run riot
You gotta run - Run riot
You know the time has come
Run - Run riot
I mean ev'ryone
Run - Yeah, run riot

Oh, gotta riot babe

Goin' thru the motions desperation guaranteed
Whoa, get f-f-frustrated easily
Pedal to the metal senses working overtime
Hey, gonna fight to the finish baby
Draw the line!

[Repeat Chorus]

(Night night night)
Run - Run riot
You gotta run - Run riot
You know the time has come
Run - Run riot
I mean ev'ryone
Run - Yeah, run riot
Speak to me!

[guitar solo]

They lock me up, they let me out but I'm up and runnin'
I scream and shout

[Repeat Chorus]

You better run - Run riot
You gotta run - Run riot
You know the time has come
Run - Run riot
C'mon, run with me
Run - Run riot
Run - Run riot

Hey!
I'll take you from your misery
C'mon! Stick with me!
