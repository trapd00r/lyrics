I woke up this morning my girl was not inside
Not inside my billfold she's done me wrong all right
We've been all night a-rockin' at the house of blue night
Ah, ah, ah-e
Ah, ah

The band was really groovin' with the shades of Jerry Lee
Somehow jiving, yeah she was taking me
Now she's gone and left me oh, baby let it be
Ah, ah, ah-e
Ah, ah, ah-e

I didn't understand her you know I mean her scene
Sleeps around for money or kicks that's twice as mean
But if I cross with her again she'll find that I'm not green
Ah, ah, ah-e
Ah, ah

This woman's a hooker
I can't stand her
She's doing me wrong
This woman's a hooker
