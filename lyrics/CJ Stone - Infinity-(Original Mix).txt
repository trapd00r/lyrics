Say say say!
Where do I go today, day, day?
Who will be my temptation?
Where is my destination?
I’ll find, find, find your trace;
Don’t you hide, hide, hide yours ways;
I’ll have so much to give, that’s the reason for me to live!

Somewhere out there is the place I belong!
Somewhere out there will be the one
That cares for me
And tries to be
My island in the storm!

Somewhere out there my heart will be worn!
Somewhere out there I’ll see the sun
That shines for me
When you will be

My silence in the Storm!

My Silence in the storm!

Say, say, say!

Say say say!
Where do I go today, day, day?
Who will be my temptation?
Where is my destination?
I’ll find, find, find your trace;
Don’t you hide, hide, hide yours ways;
I’ll have so much to give, that’s the reason for me to live!

Somewhere out there is the place I belong!
Somewhere out there will be the one
That cares for me
And tries to be
My island in the storm!

Somewhere out there my heart will be worn
Somewhere out there I’ll see the sun
That shines for me
When you will be
My silence in the Storm!

My silence in the Storm!
