GO! 
Living your life, a sentence a day. 
Put on your gray suit, tell yourself its ok. 
Walk right in, to your prison hell. 
Hating more and more, itâs like a cubicle hell. 
Keep pushing on, with a promise of awards. 
Made you lose sight of what youâre living for. 
It became a standard, a necessity. 
Now little green paper is all you see. 
Sad thing is that youâre not alone. 
Everyone here is some sort of drone. 
Slaving for the man in an office above. 
A crack of the whip and youâre back to work. 
Corporations keep you on a leash. 
Even tell you when its time to feed. 
Go in at nine, released at five. 
Complete control of your entire life. 
Started out with a passion for work. 
So they made you the company whore. 
It started out with so much love. 
But all you feel now is just fucking regret. 
Look at what youâve become! 
We werenât born just to work. 
So stop shoving it down my throat. 
Thereâs so much that I want to do. 
Cause this is my life, and Iâll enjoy it too. 
All your bullshit just held me back. 
Made me lose sight, made me lose track. 
And itâs something that I know. 
And itâs finally time to let it go. 
Itâs fucking time to let go! 
So listen up, I wonât say it twice. 
Break the chains, make sure its done right. 
Finally not caring if they agree. 
Itâs all caught up, its time to break free. 
Crawl right out of your gray suit shell.
 Making a break out of your fucking cell. 
Youâve been cooped for so damn long. 
And its time, for a prison break!
