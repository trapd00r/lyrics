Don't pick on me

'm no one

on't pick on me

t's no use

on't pick on me

'm nothing

on't pick on me

 cannot lose

in't worth trying

 just lie me a truth

on't pick on me

'm no good

on't pick on me

t takes time to change

 don't know if I want to

antasy world is a lovely place

 live in closed rooms

ith closed eyes

nd lovely lies

on't push, don't push

 don't want, don't want

our reality don't need me

on't puch, don't push

 don't want, don't want

've got my paradise inside of me

on't push

on't pick on me

'm happy

on't pick on me

 don't bother you

y fantasy is a lovely picture

our reality is an ugly truth

o go on crying

hile I laugh me a truth

on't pick on me

'm stronger

on't try to pick on me

hile I'm in here

've got lifetime protection

ollerblind in my mind

pen slightly

hat do I see

verything I don't want to be
