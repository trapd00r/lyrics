Me and you
I better laugh in 20 years from now
with some perspective and dedication
I will find somebody new

It better be someone special
He Better be coming very soon
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you

You or no one
I hope I'm wrong before I die of boredom
I wantmore than
days and nights when I amuse
myself alone

He better be someone special
He better be devoted just like you
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you

Friends forever, oh no
another girl will change your mind
in less than half the summer
So before you fall in love, I wonder
when you asked for
something that I couldn't give you
more of
Me and you
I talk as if it's now but nothing is new

She better be someone special
She better be more in love than me
And if I was your brightest hour
she is now, as far as I can see
