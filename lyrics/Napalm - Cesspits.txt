As long as things sit
pretty over here
Don't hesitate to dolefully
flatline over there

Don't overstep

Cover your hole please,
but not in my glory...
...Don't!

Deluge a chasm

Depart this dominion please
And slope off to your cesspit
Cesspits

Equal footing, as it would seem,
in pursuant to containing
the human sludge
Rank sludge, foul sludge,
the sludge

Standing of the near-immaculate
must still be shielded from
the unfortunate's junk
Just junk, weird junk, the junk

As long as things sit
pretty over there
Passed off as equal footing
Cesspits
