Down the way where the night are gay
And the sun shines dearly on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swing to and fro
I must declare my love to is there
Tough I've from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies crying out while on their heads they bear
Ackee rice, salt fish on ice and
The rum is fine any time of year

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
I won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my heart is turning around
I had to leave a girl in Kingston Town
