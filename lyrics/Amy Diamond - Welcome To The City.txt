Ey ey 

Well done, welcome to the city 
You'll become number one 
With a witty tongue
We praise the young 
Have a ball, have it all, do whatever 
Hit the wall, get the call 
And you better pay 
There's no other way 

Throw your pennies 
In a wishing well 
Might get heaven 
And you might get hell 
Thunder, lightning 
Ain't that kinda frightening 

Saints and sinners 
On the road to fame 
Ain't no winner 
'Til we know your name 
Black white, flashlight 
Show me what you got 

Have a good bite out of the city 
Take a long cold look at the world 
You might crash, burn 
Either way you'll learn 
Good bite out of the city 

(Ahh, ahh, ahh)

Free your mind, your behind's gonna follow 
Do the crime, do the time 
When tomorrow comes 
We're the pretty ones 
Shop around, settle down, get a job, be a slob 
What you get, what you give's 
Your prerogative 
That's how we live 

Throw your pennies 
In a wishing well 
Might get heaven 
And you might get hell 
Black white, flashlight 
Show me what you got 

Have a good bite out of the city 
Take a long cold look at the world 
You might crash, burn 
Either way you'll learn 
Good bite out of the city 

The way you want it or won't, yeah 
Yeah, yeah

Show and prove, do or die 
We don't sleep, we don't cry 
No no, we don't cry 
Hit 'em low, hit 'em high 
Take an eye for an eye 

Yeah!

Have a good bite out of the city 
Take a long cold look at the world 
(Oh yeah)
You might crash, you might burn 
Either way you'll learn 
Good bite out of the city 

(Have a good bite out of the city) 
Have a good bite 
Take a long cold look at the world 
You might crash, burn 
Either way you'll learn 
Good bite out of the city
