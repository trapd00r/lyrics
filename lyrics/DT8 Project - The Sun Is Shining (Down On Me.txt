I'm walking down an empty road, and I don't know,
Where it's leading to,
My heart is beating faster and I'm searching,
For the truth,
Gravity keeps pulling me and time is standing still,
Golden rays are shining,
On you...

The sun is shining down on me, now I feel you,
The rain is falling over me, and I feel only you...
The sun is shining down on me (the sun is shining down on me)
Now I feel you (now I feel you)
The rain is falling over me (the rain is falling over me)
And I feel only you... (and I feel only you..)

Spinning round I feel the heat, rising up,
Deep inside of me,
Look around and soon you'll feel the very air,
That I breathe,
Your mind and soul is all around,
I sense you are so near,
Now golden rays are shining
On me,

The sun is shining down on me (the sun is shining down on me)
Now I feel you (now I feel you)
The rain is falling over me (the rain is falling over me)
And I feel only you... (and I feel only you..)
The sun is shining down on me (the sun is shining down on me)
Now I feel you (now I feel you)
The rain is falling over me (the rain is falling over me)
And I feel only you... (and I feel only you..)
