Everyone's changing, I stay the same 
I'm a solo cello outside a chorus 
I've got a secret, it's time for me to tell
That you've been keeping me warm 

Just sweet beginnings and bitter endings 
In coffee city, we borrowed heaven 
Don't give it back, I've never felt so wanted 
Are you taking me home? 

You tell me you have to go

In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know 

Now that you've left me, there's no returning 
I keep comparing, you're always winning
I try to be strong but you'll never be more wanted 
Will you make me at home? 

Don't tell me you have to go

In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know 

To sweet beginnings and bitter endings 
In coffee city, we borrowed heaven 
Don't give it back 
Winter is coming and I need to stay warm 

The heat

In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody knows 

In the heat of summer sunshine 
I miss you like nobody else 
In the heat of summer sunshine 
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know

Summer sunshine
sunshine sunshine
