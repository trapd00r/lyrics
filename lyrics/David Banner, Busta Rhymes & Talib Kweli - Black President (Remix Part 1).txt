Like a bitch, 
Ya’ll know me 
Mississippi ho, I’m a real O.G. 

“Yeah! x7”  Backround 

{CHORUS} 

If ya sick of being sick, and ya tired of bein broke 
Go get yo guns and bring yo ass to saint’s row 

“Saint’s Row! Bitch!, 
Saint’s row, 
Bitch! 
If ya wanna do the lead on the flow, 
Bitch 

I lie, I steal cuz, nobody cares, how I feel, but, 

Saints row! 

Saints row! Saints row 

Saints row! 

I lie, I steal cuz, nobody cares, how I feel, but, 

Saint’s row! 

Saints row! Saints row! 

Saint’s row! 

Ya left me in the middle of hell wit no hope 
Ya put me in the trap with straps and no dope 
No food no water, kids drownin in the miss 
I ask god why my people gotta live like this 
I loot, I shoot, 
at ya ass, that’s survival 
Police too get slugs on arrival
Helicopters come, but they leave, wit nobody in ‘em 
Send em all to hell, where gasoline denims 
My dirty white tee and chapeaus is my outfit
All catch the black fist 
Middle finger up, like antennas
gatha', the kids, They can live wit David Banner y'all! 

{CHORUS} 

This is for Gulf Port, 
Long Beach, Pass Chris-ti-an
I watched a grown man crying 
wife slipping, from his hand 
America is fake, and ain’t never David down wit dat 
Bust ass to help out a foreign land 
Can’t live wit ma self 
And not ride for the week 
Little kids can’t eat, bodies floatin in the streets 
GB on the TV givin a fake speech 
If I die, then I’ma die tryna feed Mississippi 
This is 8 times worse than inner 9/11 was, 
Hurricane hit, 3 days, No help cuz, 
And I wonder where my president was.. 
I wonder where my president was.. 

{CHORUS} 

Yeah! 

Saint’s row! X3
