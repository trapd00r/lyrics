I feel like a cat pulling strings
Think I unraveled my mind
I dropped a mouse into the sink just to watch it climb out
Then took it to the woods and said you're free
You'll be living like this for awhile now
You're free
For awhile now at least

You say Cupid, I say Comet
You say Wallace, I say Gromit
You brought it back when I said
You promised to just call the whole thing off, please
You stay needy, I stay friendless
You stay pristine, I stay pretentious
We'd get married but it's too expensive
Let's call the whole thing off, please
Oh. my. god
This ain't a happening to me
And it's ALL. YOUR. FAULT
Said by popular decree
Possum Queen by law, she's been building up estates in East L.A

Is this your first time? That's sweet
Say "hello" to looking-forward for me
If I could set your mind at ease
This will last forever
And when it doesn't, love it for what it is
Don't miss it the way I do
The way I used to
If you love it, love it for what it's been
Don't miss it
Don't wish it back
Don't wish it'd last 'cause if it doesn't
Love it for what it is
Don't miss it the way I do
Don't miss it
Don't miss it the way I miss you
