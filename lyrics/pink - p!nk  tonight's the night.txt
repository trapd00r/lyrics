[Chorus]
Well tonight's the night I'm gonna get right
Gonna hit the scene with my friends
Tonight's the night I'ma feel alright, feel alright again
Tonight's the night I'ma do what I gotta do to get out of here
Tonight's the night I'ma feel alright, feel alright again

Bought myself a quick, cheap ticket, looking for a brand new scene
Gotta get the hell outta Hollwyood cause everything is halloween
Hit the town brass knuckles, make all the good people stare
I hope I don't end up in jail, but then again I don't really care

[Chorus]

Think it's time to have some fun, but what am I gonna wear
And where are we gonna go, and who's gonna do my hair
Got these hot ass boots, but ain't got nothing to do
Somebody better give me some gas money, we're sitting here like fools

[Chorus]

I'm leaving today, I'm going far, far, far away
Got no reason to stay cause I don't wanna play
So can you hang, it's gonna be all night

[Chorus]

Bought myself a quick, cheap ticket, looking for a brand new scene
Gotta get the hell outta Hollywood cause every day is Halloween
Hit the town with brass knuckles, all the good people stare
I hope I don't end up in jail, but then again I don't really care

[Chorus]
