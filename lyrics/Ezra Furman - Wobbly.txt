I've been feeling wobbly lately
I've been feeling wobbly, so wobbly
Feeling like they lost me
Can't find me
And they're always one step behind me
But they'll never catch me
Won't have me
Because no one can grab me
Even me
I've been feeling wobbly, real wobbly
Too wobbly

(Doo-wop refrain)

Genders: my friends
I've just been changing genders, fluidly
Because they'll never pin me
Down in the pages
Like a bug or bumblebee
Never classify me; don't try
The soul is always rising, uprising
And I'm feeling wobbly, so wobbly
I've been feeling wobbly

(Doo-wop refrain)

But sometimes
Sometimes I wobble down
Into a deep dark hole
At the bottom of the ocean floor
They all just seem so fixed
Everything seems so straight
But I don't want to stay down here
I want to be free-

Wobbly, so wobbly
I've been feeling wobbly, real wobbly
I'm just glad they left me
Alone because now I can find the truth of me
And if you think you love me
Take warning:
Don't get too attached to just one
Me, because I've been feeling wobbly
So wobbly, I've been feeling wobbly

(Doo-wop refrain)
