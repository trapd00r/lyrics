If all you've got to do today is find peace of mind
Come round
You can take a piece of mine
And if all you've got to do today is hesitate
Come here, you can leave it late with me

Chorus:
You could be taking it easy on yourself
You should be making it easy on yourself
Cos you and i know, its all over the front page
You give me road rage
Racing through the best days
It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy
Thinking you may be losing your mind

If all you've got to prove today is your innocence.
Calm down, you're as guilty as can be
If all you've got to lose alludes to yesteray
Yesterday's through, now do anthing you please.

Repeat Chorus

You, you've been racing to the best days
Space age, road rage, fast lane

If all you've got to do today is find peace of mind
Come here
You can take a piece of mine

Repeat chorus

Space age, road rage, fast lane, minimum wage
Home late, upgrade, short-changed, golden age
Front page, lose face, handmade, space ache
Backstage, outraged, disgraced, maximum weight
