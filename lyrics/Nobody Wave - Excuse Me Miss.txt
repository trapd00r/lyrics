How about the possibility of you and I
Lady can we try
Lady say you're with it
If you're not with it, get it 'scuse me

Can't make you stay
If you want to go
Sugar I can't make you love me
If you're heart says no
There's one thing I'm certain of
And I know it's true
Can't nobody does it like I do like I do

Hey excuse me please
You sure look good to me
With your straight hair up braids
Kinda got my momma's waves (kinda got my momma's waves)
How about the possibility of you and I
Lady can we try
Lady say you're with it
If you're not with it, get it 'scuse me

The first time I saw your thighs
That's when I realized
My heart - it skipped a beat
I can't seem to make you see
I tried everything in my book
I'm laughing cause you won't even look
I gotta stop wasting my time so excuse me please

Can't make you stay
If you wanna go
Sugar I can't make you love me
If you're heart says no
There's one thing I'm certain of
And I know it's true
Can't nobody does it like I do like I do

I'm a try this one more time
You look like virgin eyes
This one here might be true
And here's a few fools for you
I - I wanna be married but free
I gotta let the drama miss me
Could this apple fit on your tree
If not excuse me please

Hey excuse me please
You sure look good to me
With your straight hair up braids
Kinda got my momma's waves (kinda got my momma's waves)
