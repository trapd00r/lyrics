There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart 
For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there 
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore 
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore 
 
We shall sing on that beautiful shore for the melodious songs of the blessed 
And our spirits shall sorrow no more not a sight for the blessing of rest 
In the sweet by and by... 
To a bountiful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise 
For the glory as gift of his love and the blessing that howlered days 
In the sweet by and by... 
In the sweet by and by...
