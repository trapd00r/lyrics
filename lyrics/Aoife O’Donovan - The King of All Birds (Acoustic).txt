[Verse 1]
Look out, look out
Here I come now, fists out
I'm a fighter bird
I’m a Harrier hawk, a wild flock
I keep time by the city clock
When the moon is steady, I'll find you
I'm not lucky and I’m not scared
There could be goldmine anywhere

[Chorus]
Anyone that I might want in this world
They're asleep in the arms of another girl
Who will they be when the lights come up?
Everyone that I ever loved in my life
Now calls somebody else their wife
Who am I to you?

[Verse 2]
Get up, get up
Get it together and climb on up
To the top of the tree
I'm an owl now, a lonely owl
Who, who, where, what, why, when
How the hell did I get this far without you
Pull my feathers one by one
Put 'em in your pocket when I'm gone

[Chorus]
Anyone that I might want in this world
They're asleep in the arms of another girl
Who will they be when the lights come up?
Everyone that I ever loved in my life
Now calls somebody else their wife
Who am I to you?

[Bridge]
Who am I to you? Am I just anyone?
Am I the only one?

[Verse 3]
Come on, come on
Put me back together, let me soldier on
I'm the King of it all
I'm a little wren, I’m happiest when
I hitch a ride on the wing of a friend
Looking down on everything then
When the road gets weary love
Remember who I’m dreaming of
