I made a promise to my momma
That I'll bless her with some grandkids, she can spoil them
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day (homie)
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get them all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah
Now we All-American, we All-American

I swear to God I put the hero in Heroin
These flows, kilos
I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil
Nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit
Now I keep some dead face in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Breezing my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me?
Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it
I know (I know)
I got a problem, I'mma take care of it
Weight I'm carrying, gotta let it go
(It won't hold me down no more)

Yeah, okay, back then they used to call me little
But now I'm ridin' something clean in a coat made of armadillo
They haven't got the memo, they sayin' I'm the shit though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius
Each and every day some save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees
I'm the plug, what you need though?
I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat

Cause fools worried about a wave, I'm a NAVY seal
Come with me, I can make your life change for real
Always had a dream of stuntin'

Just a young motherfucker with a plan
Thought I was the man
