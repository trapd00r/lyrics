Back in 1934
He came bangin' on the backstage door
Askin' for my hard earned pay
Then he drank it all away you know
That's the way it goes
It was come what may

Off we all went to the war
They stole five years, and so much more you know
I was a stranger to my wife
This is the story of my life you know
Slow slow quick quick slow
Then we were on our way

I looked through my window and the slate was gray
Over the rooftops and far away
I had a secret I had a plan
One day I'll be a family man

And on that Butlins holiday
I heard a calling seems like yesterday
We sailed off to that distant shore
40 years and maybe more you know
On and on we go
Then it all fades away

Out through my window and into the gray
Over the rooftops and far away
This was my secret this was my plan
Now I'm remembered as a family man

Out through my window and into the gray
Over the rooftops and far away
I had a secret I had a plan
One day I'd be a family man
