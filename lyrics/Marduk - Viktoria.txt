Slim and slender - fast as agreyhound
Tough as leather and hard as Krupp steel
Swearing loyalty to death beyond the torches' light
Steadfastly marching to the beat of the drum

Well-rehearsed - iron clanks from flank to flank
Eager for glory and hungry for cursed pride
Too young to fear death but just old enough to die
Steadfastly marching to the pulse of the gun

Viktoria - Viktoria

Viktoria - Viktoria

Slim and slender - fast as agreyhound
Tough as leather and hard as Krupp steel
Sowing blood to harvest honour in the Devil's trench
Carefully chosen to fight till kingdom come

Discipline - iron will from flank to flank
Obedience through blind self-sacrifice
Too young to know death but just old enough to kill
Fervently wading through the blood of the sun

Viktoria - Viktoria
