A snake has bitten me, it has made me weak
God's betrayted me, playing hide and seek
So much joy keeps slipping through my fingers
So much pain I've chosen on my way

Seven serpents laying on my bed of fire
Oh how real the dream appears, how strong the dark desire
Hold me like our love was in it's sweet beginning
Whisper all those lies you know I long to hear
But you say that

Poison is drowning my poor heart
Poison is killing out our spark
Poison has made it's ways in me
Poison, let me go peacefully
Standing on the porch, with a burning torch
Looking at the dark skies of Eden

Be my exorcist, take the bad away
The lonely violinist plays and turns the sheets of days
So much joy you've layed upon my sorrow
So much shame you've taken off my name
You say that

Poison is drowning my poor heart
Poison is killing out our spark
Poison has made it's ways in me
Poison, you and I eternally
Standing on the porch, with a flameing torch
Looking at the dark skies of Eden
