Oh wonderful one why are you like that?
Glow in the darkness, that's how we do it
Just like the stars upon your ceiling that
Put you to sleep after

Close the blind the darkness of your room
In your room
There's your headache explain it at your talk-talk-talk
Hanging with your feet-feet-feet
Hanging with your feet
Cause here
We are
Apart but not
Again
And again
Again
And again
That doesn't make sense
So put away your tools

Let me show

And in the end they ask you for
Your reply
Don't you tell them
What you found out
There's time
