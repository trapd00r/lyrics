The only thing i can say,
Is that if we're here today,
It's because our generation,
Is looking for some action.

The only thing i can say,
Now is thank you
'cause if we are here today,
It is because of you,
The party generation,
Now is going,
To moove on for some action,
So keep dancing

The "robot voice" says the same except that :

The party generation,
Now is going,
To make a mess everywhere,
So keep dancing.
