I'm waiting, yes I am
To find the perfect plan
A plan to spill your tear
I feel so full of me
I don't know why

I wanna give you pain
So you feel like the rain
The rain is pouring down
I feel so full of me
I don't know why

I should be there... x3
To hear we're crawling
See we're falling
I'll be there

I should be there... x3
I feel so full of me
I don't know why

Short happy life
Can't you see I'm all right
When you'll die
I won't move
Just wanna look at you
Keep on living after you
Yeah
Ohoho yheeea... x2
