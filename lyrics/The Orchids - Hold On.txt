You hold me inside your iris
like a terminal stain on life
You condescend to my primal brain
and twist me around like a knife
Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you

DON'T - try to be the ONE - person
Who has STAYED - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
God, I never learn...

You keep me hidden behind a curtain,
an audible human display
You feed me orchids to give me courage
and keep me in line with disdain

Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you

DON'T - try to be the ONE - person
Who has STAYED - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
God, I never learn:

I have nothing left for you...
you left me with nothing

I live at arm's length and die a little,
between your constants by day
I want my soul back before it's over,
I can't even wish you away

Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you

DON'T - try to be the ONE - person
Who has STAYED - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
God, I never learn:

I NEVER LEARN!!
