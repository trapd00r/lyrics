Who are you
The one for whom I'd really gladly suffer
Who are you
The one I'll always love above another
You're my world, you're my hope
You're all my dreams and all my heart

Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who are you
Who loves as deep as I do

Who are you
Who takes me through the flood and through the fire
Who are you
Who leads me through the desert and the dry
You're in my thoughts, you know my mind
You're all my things, you're all my light

Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who are you
Who loves as deep as I do

You're my savior, you're my center
My beginning and my end
You're the one I live for, you're my angel
Who are you
You're in my thoughts (in my thoughts)
You know my mind (you know my mind)
You're all my things, you're all my light

Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who are you
Who loves as deep as I do
Who are you
Who fell on me like fire
Who are you
Who chained me to desire

Who are you
The one I give my life to
