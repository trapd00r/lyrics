[Intro:]
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

[Verse 1:]
You see that chick in the gym checking me out?
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wrecking the house 
That was suppose to be wreckless, where the heck is it now?
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it
A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn wratchet
A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet
A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs
Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances
I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya

[Chorus 1:]
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

[Verse 2:]
My equilibrium is off, must me the Lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extracurriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Liddy-young?
I want up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-
Zalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

[Chorus 2:]
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?
Some are open and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

[Verse 3:]
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery 
to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged
He's sees the loner getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-agains
Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'
Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-
-ants for his back and a couple of packs
Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back
Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back

[Chorus 2]

And so I'm sayin...

[Outro:]
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)
