I've seen myself in a thousand faces 
Strung out on life's path 
I would add up what you mean to me 
But I cannot do the math 
And this fashionista's garden party 
Well I had enough of that 

'Cause the only one I come undone for is you 
Yes the only one I come undone is you

But I'm a special lover sometimes 
But you only touch a ghost 
I'm a sycophantic courtier with an elegant riposte 
And needless to say you're the one that I need the most 

'Cause the only one I come undone for is you 
Yes the only one I come undone for is you 
Well the only one I come undone for is you 

I know I'm done (I) 
And now I see the truth 
I know I'm done (I) 
Come undone for you 
And you've been gone for so long 
Waiting here for you 
You've been gone for so long 
Come undone for you 

There are people in this lifetime that we should never meet 
'Cause to be here now without you 
Well, my life's so incomplete 
I'll tell you what you mean to me and maybe then you'll see 
Ahhh 
Ahhh, nahh 

'Cause the only one I come undone for is you 
Yes the only one I come undone for is you 
Oh the only one I come undone for is you 

No, noâ€¦
