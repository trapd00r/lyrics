In this room
There’s a man with a heart
That I can understand
He believes in God and that he
Will be back again

In this room there's love
You can always come here
To feel it again
But if someone leaves
You desperately
Wish them back again

In this room there’s a girl
Here is she happy with her pain
She believes in something else
But at least
She will fall again

Just a little bit away from home
Is this room

In this room there’s a soul
That is pouring you your wine
And it plays to you the music
That will make you stick around

In this room there is peace
I see angels all around
I believe it in so much
I am the last one
To be around
