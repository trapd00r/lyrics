Bird singing la la la la
The sky is still but it's not what they saw
I have to get home to my heart
I lost it long ago and I need a fresh new start

Home
Just take me home
Home
Just take me home

I'm leaving la la la land
Where all the castles are made out of sand
I have to get back to my pond
My city always sleeps without a sound

Have you ever seen the sun in the summer not setting?
Oh we will dance all night
If you wanna come along you will never forget it
Oh we will save the light

Bird singing la la la la
I guess you have to leave to know just what you got
I have to get home to my heart
I lost it long ago and I need a fresh new start
Oh we will save the light
Just let me come back, come back home
