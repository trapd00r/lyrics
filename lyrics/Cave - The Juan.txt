Laid awake, I tried to escape
Your love won't catch me

Locked you in my turning page
I'll always be free

I love you too, I'm not scared for you darling
I'll make you mine all of my dirt
All I could do is dream of you darling
I'm in a dream cave

Our words and all of our words
I know you'll pull through
Here I am, I love it again
I'll always be true

I love you too, I'm not scared for you darling
I'll make you mine all of my dirt
All I could do is dream of you darling
I'm in a dream cave

I'm in a dream cave
