I love and I need you 
Nelly, I love you, I do 
Need you 


No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I’m with my Boo 
Boy, you know I’m crazy over you 


No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I’m with my Boo 
You know I’m crazy over you 


Uh-uh-uh-uh 
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block 
from me 
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing I need 
to see 
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son, oh-oh, but 
that’s okay 
‘Cause I wait for my cue and just listen, play my 
position 
Like a shortstop, pick up e’rything mami hittin’ 
And in no time I better make this friend mine and 
that’s for sure 
‘Cause I-I never been the type to break up a happy 
home 
But there’s something ‘bout baby girl, I just can’t 
leave her ‘lone 
So tell me, ma, what’s it gonna be 
She said, "You don’t know what you mean to me," come 
on 


No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I’m with my Boo 
Boy, you know I’m crazy over you 


No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I’m with my Boo 
You know I’m crazy over you 


Uh-uh-uh-uh 
I see a lot in your look and I never say a word 
I know how n****s start actin’ trippin’ , and hate up 
all the girls 
And there’s no way Nelly go for it 
Ain’t f***in’ with no dame, as you could see 
But I-I like your steeze, your style, your whole 
demeanor 
The way you come through and holler, and swoop me in 
his two-seater 
Now that’s gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya, 
don’t you forget it 
But it ain’t that easy for you to back up and leave 
him 
But you and me we got ties for different reasons 
I respect that and right before I turned to leave 
She said, "You don’t know what you mean to me," come 
on 


No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I’m with my Boo 
Boy, you know I’m crazy over you 


No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I’m with my Boo 
You know I’m crazy over you 


Sing it for me, K 


I love and I need you 
Nelly, I love you, I do 
And it’s more than you’ll ever know 
Boy, it’s for sure 
You can always count on my love 
Forever more, yeah, yeah 


East coast, I know you’re shakin’ right 
Down south, I know you’re bouncin’ right 
West coast, I know you’re walkin’ right

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I’m with my Boo 
Boy, you know I’m crazy over you 


No matter what I do

Even when I’m with my Boo 
You know I’m crazy over you
