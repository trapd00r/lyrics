It's plain to see
You can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigga for life

(Black Child)
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
(Ja Rule)
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life

(Ja Rule)
Whos that chipped out
Twenty one year old, hot commodity
Coming out of a bum deal lottery
With a flow like sodomy
Put it on your bitch ass quite properly
I suggest you keep all eyes on me
And don't sleep as it is I'm highly critique
Pussy, money, murder it's part of my mystique
You feelin' me this here is one of Queens elite
Predecessor of the street
While you munch I eat
JA's here
The nigga you love but still fear
I done been there done that
Now nigga it's my year
I can leave you on the clear view
If you ain't yet clear
Matter of fact if you breathin' be glad you got air
Shut the fuck up
When grown folks are talkin' you hear
Or get your shit blown baby
From mouth to ear
Don't fear when you smoke weed and fuckin' your wife
Why? 'cause I'm a nigga for life

(Black Child] [x2)
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas

Spare yourself the reality of a n ass whippin'
What I'm givin' when I be gettin' tight and start flippin'
On your bitch ass niggas that like formin' a cipher
Gates me hyper
Want the real I'm a slice ya
Light ya
Ass up with sixteen or more slugs
Comin' from my snub nose bull dog
Raw, to the core lets lay down some laws
This is JA's house bow down or bring the war
Mother fuckers
Y'all don't want to touch what's hot
Whatever it be mic, glock, drug spot
Like a bitch you scared of life and takin' chances
And right now you showin' more ass then an exotic dancer
The answer is this
Niggas don't wanna touch
JA is livin' stronger then a fucking coke rush
See on the streets we be killin' niggas like cash
And you heard I.N.C. nigga it's murda

Nigga, I live among thorough breads
Raised to blaze lead
If you get shot play dead
And put two in his head
I'm known to pasteurize
And criticize
A nigga size
Look him right in the eyes
And leave him dead where he lies
We come through mobbin'
Like crips from Compton
We're all in burners and sippin' on gin
Fuck Flossin'
Nigga I'm burnin' iron
And if you ain't buyin'
Then you're dyin'
From denyin'
I'm so inspirin'
To the youth, see I'm settin it strait
Lettin' them know never to step on nothin' less then an eighth
And the longer it takes
Some body is gonna die for it
The streets is watchin'
Jigga warned you don't ignore it
It's only niggas holdin'
Go JAP and blow yen
With the six double strait out of the pin
Brandishin
Steal for the ice
Hioldin my dick
Talkin' shit
Shootin' dice
A nigga for life

So whatcha sayin' is
What the fuck is a nigga?
Rob a bitch, slap a bitch
All that shit

(Black Child] [x2)
For life we gonna be niggas
Fuck the world it's yours my niggas
Load the nine and blaze my niggas
(Ja Rule)
Yeah, 'cause I'm a nigga for life
