Uh oh, Uh oh, Uh oh, Uh oh,

Honestly
If a I tell, tell you what,
What you want to know love
There ain't another,
Don't want no other lover
I put nothing above ya.
I kick them to the gutter.
You try to shake me but wound up loving me crazy now

Look at us lately and tell them who's your lady
I'd never thought you'd be the one,
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs,
No in and out to here right now.

If you want me to stay
I never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

Uh oh, Uh oh, Uh oh, Uh oh

Now all your loving that
We're happy it's a fact
Can't nothing hold us back.
We got this in the bag
There ain't no maybe
No questions ,love you daily now

Look at us lately and tell them who's your lady
I'd never thought you'd be the one,
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs,
No in and out to here right now.

If you want me to stay
I never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh (x8)
