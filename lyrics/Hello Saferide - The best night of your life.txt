I saw you as soon as you entered the door
I knew I was right not to leave before
From this stupid masquerade party we're at -
Yeah yeah yeah

I came here dressed like Audrey Horne and
You came here dressed like Salieri
Well Amadeus is making out with Joey Ramone

Don't think we've met!
Only in my dreams ev'ry night
Well nice to meet you
I won't let you out of my sight
Oh no that's wrong
Then how could it feel so right
You don't know it yet but it's the best night of your life
Aaaa

I hear your voice, boy it's dark as the devil's
Why are you standing there talking to Pebbles?
And I've got a penguin checking me out
Yeah, yeah yeah

You've got the sad eyes of a poet
I know all of that is bullshit
I've seen that you got a carpenters hands

I've got to go!
Don't act older than you are
But I've got work
Get working and go to the bar
I've got a girlfriend
She doesn't have to know where you are
You don't know it yet, but it's the best night of your life
Aaaa
