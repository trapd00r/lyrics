Spinning around
Spinning around
Ohh

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this

Traded in my sorrows for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say

I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it

The mistakes I've made, have given me the strength
To really believe
And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cuz it's gotta be real

I've got nothin' left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cuz the truth's given me
A new freedom inside, gettin' rid of my desire
Do you like what you see?

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this

Baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby

I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this

Feelin' me 'cause you like it like this, oh, I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh, ooh yeah
Like it like this, like it like this, I'm not the same
Like it like this, I'm not the same, oh
