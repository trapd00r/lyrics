We touch I feel a rush, we clutch it isn't much
But it's enough, to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must, be a sorceress
'Cause you just, did the impossible, gained my trust

Don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, 'cause I've been treated like dirt, before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no, love for these mo'fuckin' hoe's

Blood sucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department but, I ain't had no luck with this

It's sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be, like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, like some kind of emotional roller-coaster
Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket-ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles, on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that, until we get that person that we think's

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelin's change
It's not a contest, and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you, must have been fate

But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me, if I cave in and break
And leave myself open, that I won't be makin' a mistake, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket-ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles, on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms

Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason

I could think of to let you walk up out this house, and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you just go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our, love
Just promise me you'll think of me, every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket-ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles, on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without you
