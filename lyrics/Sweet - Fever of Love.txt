You took the apple from the tree
And gave the fruits of love to me
But love is blind I couldn't see
(I could not see...)
Those neon nights you'd left behind
You should have laid it on the line
Procrastination stole my time
The day has come the years will go by
Things have changed have opened my eyes
And she tried to hide the feeling inside
But you know and you know and you know

The fever of love is like a hundred above
You are the one that turns me on (good god)
The fever of love is like a hundred above
I got you under my skin
You are my adrenalin
I've got your love in my veins
It's gonna ease the pain
In my heart, in my heart

Good vibrations came today
God only knows they're gonna stay
But psychic waves can fade away
(Fade) (Away)
You are the guardian of my soul
Who'll turn my memories to Gold
I'll still be younger when I'm older
I'm feeling high on pure emotion
I know I could cry an ocean
And I can't hide my feelin' inside
But you know and you know and you know

The fever of love is like a hundred above
You are the one that turns me on (good god)
The fever of love is like a hundred above
I got you under my skin
You are my adrenalin
I've got your love in my veins
It's gonna ease the pain
In my heart, in my heart

The fever of love oh, oh...
