[Intro - Travi$ Scott:]
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
(Major Lazer) word
Straight up!

[Verse 1 - Pusha T:]
Outlaw, outlaw, like I hit the PowerBall
Once all eyes is on me, floating off like South Paul
Niggas love to count yours, hoping that your people fall
Wishin' death upon me, but I'm here forevermore
I just get debated on, I just get my greatest on
Saint Laurent on speed dial, I just put the latest on
Bring it on, bring it on, you want more, then bring it on
Set this bitch on fire, nigga, we can have a sing-a-long

[Hook 2x - Travi$ Scott:]
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is the gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz:]
I got a California king in my condo
Got a motherfuckin' big screen by the front door
Got a guest bedroom filled up with fur coats
Nigga ain't no room in this bitch to even jump rope
Yeah, the fire and desire and I'm higher than my prior
My attire I acquire might require a Malayah
Whoa might accept ya, and deny ya, no denial
I'll be in the court room on the table screamin', "Rider!"

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3 – Mad Cobra]
Tell them likkle pussy, deh nuh violate, violate
21 outta di clip me fire str8
White line, yellow tip, book your flight, look a date
Send di pussy back to di maker whether hell or higher gate
Yeah! Clip big diss badman yuh get a split wig, split wig!
Undertaker looks see what a sick did
West coast, East coast, we love weapons
Bullet through ya fuckin' vest left ya chest exposed

[Hook 2x]

[Bridge – Travi$ Scott:]
All we do is relax, sit back and smoke
We ain't got no job, we goin' from broke
That ain't stoppin' from gettin', gettin' inside of ya
Takin' off in our cars, feel like we in the air screamin'
Gansta
Straight metal, straight metal
You need to know that I'm a rider

[Hook]

Straight up!
Major Lazer
Yeah!
Straight up!
