Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...

I'm a fake, I'm all bad, I'm all hype
Whatever I say, don't believe me
I'm a flake, ain't it sad, I'm your type
Whatever I do, you won't leave me

Stay out all night, strung out on crack
Face my contempt or get stabbed in the back
Fire in my eyes, frost in my heart
Still you don't wanna part

One more chance
I ask, one more chance

You and me, we were meant to be
I didn't mean to hurt you
Can't you see, we were meant to be
I didn't mean to hurt you, baby

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...

I'm so sly, I'm a flirt, I'm untrue
Whatever I say, don't believe me
So you cry, so you hurt, so what's new
Whatever I do, you won't leave me

Caught in the act, lie my way out
Give me the benefit when there's no doubt
Think that you knew right from the start
Still you don't wanna part

One more chance
I ask, one more chance

You and me, we were meant to be
I didn't mean to hurt you
Can't you see, we were meant to be
I didn't mean to hurt you, baby

You wait by the phone for my call
Meanwhile I'm havin' a ball
I doubt if I call you at all

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...

You and me, meant to be
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...)
You and me, meant to be
You and me, meant to be
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...)
You and me, meant to be
You and me, meant to be
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...)
You and me, meant to be
You and me, meant to be
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh...)
You and me, meant to be
