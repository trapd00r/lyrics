He couldn't move as seasoned as he was.
There was something in this one
That was too much for him.
He had a daughter he hoped to live through.
Four years old, ten years reach to this girl.

Please let my girl go
Without knowing what I know
Don't let her read this day
On my face when I come home

Detective, take note of all you see,
Like her hand still holding the smallest leaf.
Her neck angled too far for her body
And her body's position at the base of this tree.

He wrote measurements on a pad of paper,
Noted each bruise and abrasion.
How could this happen to a girl so young?
