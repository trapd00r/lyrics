It's a girl thing with the right swing,
So move over while we do our thing

It's the end of an era
The start of a new day,
We've got the mic and
We're gonna rock it our way
People sayin that the world has changed
Cos the power to the girl
But the girls the same
We've got feminine touch in all the right places
Stars on our eyes and smiles on our faces
Round one is over, hear the bell ring
So move over while we do our thing

Don't get me wrong, we're not tryin to front
But Cindy was right, girls just wanna have fun
It's a girl thing, with the right swing
G for the girl and T for the thing
Cos life's a game and we all like to play
But when it comes to love 
We love to do it our way
Some say we're physically demanding 
Only cos we're the last one standing

Pull you're baby nearer, it's the end of an era
And we're the last one standing
It's your party, keep us here
Let's stay up all night
And be the last one standing

Try forgettin everything that you've heard before
No matter how many times you hear this,
You'll wanna hear it some more
This is our year, so have no fear
We're gonna stay, you know we're gonna take it all the way
Tight knitted we're fitted 
No one can break us, take us
Away from each other, brother 
Cos when the girls wanna hit the scene
Together like a team, we're gonna take it to the extreme

A wink and a smile's always worth your while
But when the girls step to it
You know that we can do it
Come and check the vibe and all the rhymes we're bringing
Beat so hard got alarm bells ringing
Watch the girls shine, don't walk away
It's our time, and we wanna play
So if you find this physically demanding
It's no surprise we're the last one standing

Pull you're baby nearer, it's the end of an era
And we're the last one standing
It's your party, keep us here
Let's stay up all night
And be the last one standing

Nothing's keeping us down
Because we're on tonight 
And there's no denying it
The world's a merry-go-round
The time has come tonight
For gettin' down let's party yeah...

Pull you're baby nearer, it's the end of an era
And we're the last one standing
It's your party, keep us here
Let's stay up all night
And be the last one standing
