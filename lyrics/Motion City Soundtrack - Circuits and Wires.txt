I am all circuits and wires
Conducting symphonies of heat exchange energies
Fueled by a nervous system thrust through the great unknown
A timid mess of frightened bones
I pledge to make the difference
I aim to take no stand
This bitter silence is the only play I have
In light of all their laughter, I'll take to keeping shy
A resolution that I've finally had enough
Can't speak, can't speak, can't speak at all
Don't even think you know the reason
I know there's something wrong within my faulty brain
I lack the proper behavior
My temper-addled tongue can't seem to force it out
The words that linger inside me

Can't speak, can't speak, can't speak at all
Don't even think you know the reason
Can't speak, can't speak, can't speak at all
Don't even try to understand

I am all motors and gadgets
Organically designed to last a finite length of time
Locked in this rotary motion, the wheel spins round and round
I comprehend it all but still can't make a sound
I know there's something wrong within my faulty brain
I lack the proper behavior
My temper-addled tongue can't seem to force it out
The words that linger inside me

Can't speak, can't speak, can't speak at all
Don't even think you know the reason
Can't speak, can't speak, can't speak at all
Don't even try to understand

I am all circuits and wires
Conducting symphonies of heat exchange energies
My temper-addled tongue can't seem to force it out
The words that linger inside me
