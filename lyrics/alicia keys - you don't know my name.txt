Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
Really, really wanted to catch your eye
Somethin' special 'bout you
I must really like you
'Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time

Oh baby, baby, baby
It's getting kind of crazy
'Cause you are taking over my mind

(Chorus)
And it feels like oooooh
You don't know my name
I swear, it feels like ooooooh
You don't know my name
(round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

Oh! Baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
Doing everything that makes me smile
When we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
ooh it set my soul on fire
oooh Baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild

(Chorus) 
It feels like oooooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it baby, it feels like ooooooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doing to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like, Oh!
Doing nothing I've ever done, for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of me
'Cause did I mention (oh!) You bout' to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels
To have, all my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience, my lovin (oh!)
'Cause my lovin feels like

(Chorus)
oooooh
You Don't Know my name
And I swear it feels like
oooooooh
You Don't my name

Will you ever know it?
I'm going to have to go ahead and just call this boy
Hello, can I speak to..to Michael
Oh hey, how ya' doin'?
I feel kinda' silly doin' this, but uh
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
(Chuckle) you know the one with the braids?
Yeah
Well I see you on Wednesday's, all the time
You come on every Wednesday on your lunch break I think
You always order the special, with the hot chocolate
Look man I mean, I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wonderin'
if maybe we could get together outside the restaurant one day
You know, 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
(Chuckle) Wait a minute, my cell phones breakin' up
Can you hear me now?
yeah, so what day did you say?
Oh, Thursday's perfect

(Chorus)
And it feels like oooohhh
You Don't Know My name
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
oooooooh
oooooooh
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Will you ever know?
