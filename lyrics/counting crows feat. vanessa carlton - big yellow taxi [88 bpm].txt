They paved paradise and put up a parking lot,
With a pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot.

Don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone,
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum,
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them.

Now, now, now, don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone,
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

Hey Farmer Farmer, put away your DDT,
I don't care about spots on my apples,
Leave me the birds and the bees, please.

Don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone,
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot,
Hey now, they paved paradise to put up a parking lot,
Why not?

Listen late last night I heard the screen door slam,
And a big yellow taxi took my girl away,
Now, don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone,
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

Hey now, now, don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone,
They paved paradise to put up a parking lot, why not?
They paved paradise and put a parking lot,
Hey hey hey, paved paradise to put up a parking lot.

I dont wanna give it,
Why you wanna give it,
Why you wanna giving it all away?
Hey, hey, hey,
Now you wanna give it,
Ah she wanna give it,
'Cause she giving it all away,
Now, now, I don't wanna give it,
Why you wanna give it,
Why you wanna giving it all away?
Giving it all, giving it all away,
Yeah, yeah.

Why you want me?

'Cause she giving it all away, hey, hey, hey.

Hey, paved paradise to put up a parking lot.
