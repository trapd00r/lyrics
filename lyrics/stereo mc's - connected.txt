Somethin' ain't right
Gonna get myself, I'm gonna get myself
Gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light which is reflected
I see thru you, I see thru you
I see thru you, I see thru you
Ya dirty tricks, ya make me sick
I see thru you, I see thru you
Gonna do it again, gonna do it again
I'm (gonna do it again, gonna do it again)
Gotta do right (gonna do it again)
'Cause somethin' ain't right (gonna do it again)
Gotta do right, come on

If you make sure you're connected,
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected,
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall

I, ain't gonna go blind
Gonna get myself, I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light that is reflected
Hear me out
Do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
I wanna do it again, I wanna do it again
I wanna thru it again
Ya terrified (I wanna do it again)
Ain't gonna go blind, ain't gonna go blind
(I wanna do it again) here we go

If you make sure you're connected,
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected,
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall, hear me out
Stumble you might fall

Interstate 5 stayin' alive
Won't someone try open up your eyes
You must be blind if you can't see
The gapin' hole called reality
Ow, wanna do it again,
I know I'm gonna do it again
I wanna do it again, come on,
I'm gonna do it again
Hear me out, terrified
Somethin' ain't right, here we go

If you make sure you're connected,
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected,
Stumble you might fall
