(boy don't you know that)

All nite i think of you (get out)
I want to be your lady baby (get out)
I still love you boo, can't wait to hate you (get out)
I just can't go on cause i gave my all to (get out)

Ohh this was a love phenomenon no one could explain
And i wish i could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us everynight
Wanna pause it but i can't make it stay
Just gotta let it play

We went round for round till we knocked love out (out, out, out)
Laying in the ring not making a sound (ye, ye, yeah)

And i just wanna hold you, (i'm desert)
Touch you,
Feel you,
Be near you,
I miss you,
Baby, baby, baby

I'm tired of tryin to fake through
But there's nothing i can do
Boy i can't wait to hate you
(boy don't you know that)
I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like i do
Still can't shake you off
(boy don't you know that)
I can't wait break through these emotional changes
(aw... mc)
Seems like such a lost cause
(let's go to the east side)

[oj da juiceman]

Uhh shawty hate me

She even hate my dirty draws
Tryin to keep it real
Everytime she try to shake me off
I'm okay, i'll be good
Everyday for lay me on
H-a-t-e on your juice,
But you can't lead on jui melon
Everytime i come around you sneak and try to use your phone
Girl you should know that
You men riot on its crown
Its ain't jury, dirty, think you have familiar on my home

The situation is not that race
I know we ain't one, that's a lot stake we gotta say honey
Since the day one, i was the real deal
No big just me and this apple appeal (shit)
I just wanna pee a lot in the field,
Pill me before somebody gets killed (really)
I kinda see all the spilled milk (that, that)
Cad that it up, this time don't be risk
No worries, no flurries
No blusets, cold shoulder
Could bloodies, no desert
And now that i'm older i told ya
The gold fast sum
They play it when i'm colder
Then apole would be a strong man
Then my shoulder to the dow place
