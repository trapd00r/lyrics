Take me back to the place where I first saw the light
To my sweet sunny south, take me home
Where the mocking birds sing me to sleep every night

Oh why was I tempted to roam
The path to our cottage they say has grown green
And the place is quite lonely around
I know that the smiles and the forms that I've seen
Now lie in the dark mossy ground

Take me back to the place where I first saw the light
To my sweet sunny south, take me home
Where the mocking birds sing me to sleep every night

Take me back to the place where the orange trees grow
To my plot in the evergreen shade
Where the flowers from the river green margin did grow
And spread their sweet scene through the glade

Take me back to the place where I first saw the light
To my sweet sunny south, take me home
Where the mocking birds sing me to sleep every night
