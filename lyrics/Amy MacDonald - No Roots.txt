Somewhere out there's a dream that's not forgotten
But this world is never stopping for me
But I will try and I will keep on trying
I set my goals there's no denying
Never stop fighting
For What I believe

Many people will come and go
Many faces long lost you know
Many fights many makeups
Many kisses, too many breakups

I got no roots they're not set in stone
I got no place that I call home
I'm just a low low lonely soul

I got no roots they're not set in stone
I got no place that I call home
I'm just a low low lonely soul

And the time will come when the day is done
And the fighting's over the race is run
I don't know what I'm looking for
And this life I lead it's a curious thing
But I can't deny the happiness it brings
I don't know what I'm looking for

Many people will come and go-o-o
Many faces long lost you know
I'm just a low low lonely soul

And there'll be many fights many makeups
Many kisses, too many breakups
A low low lonely soul

I got no roots they're not set in stone
I got no place that I call home
I'm just a low low lonely soul
