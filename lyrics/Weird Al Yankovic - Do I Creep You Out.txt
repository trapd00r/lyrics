I know that you don't know me very well
We've barely met, but I can surely tell
No one will ever love you like I do

I like to feel the warm spot on your chair
Sometimes I drool and usually I stare
My precious one
I saved that gum... that you threw in the garbage

You're the one I dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I creep you out?
Every time I shake your hand, now
Wanna stick your fingers in my mouth
Well, do I creep you out?

Call you every night and hang up
Gonna carve your name in my leg
In my leg

Something I should ask about...
Can I sniff the pit stains on your blouse?
And do I creep you... do I creep you out?

Your restraining order's out
Still the only question with me now
Is do I creep you out?
Know exactly where you live now
Followed you from work back to your house
Well, do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
