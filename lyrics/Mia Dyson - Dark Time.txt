Smoking your motherâ€™s cigarettes
Writing verses, talking tough
You could have told me anything
I wanted to believe
With a powder-blue guitar your face turned away, you would sing for me
A song so filled with pain
Oh, the guts and the shame
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
Oh I wonder if you ever miss that time
Lying on your single bed
Sneaking out, after dark
Seeing things through your eyes
I was on your side
You started a mighty fire
Throwing colours, bearing light
It burned bright in my eyes
I had to look away
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
Oh, I wonder if you ever miss that time
Oh, I wanted you to feel that you were loved
Oh, I wanted you to know I think of you still
