Low down bum, downtown bar
So far gone, covered in scars
Swung for the fans, shot for the stars
Miscalculating, landed on Mars
Ain't got a worry, ain't got a cause
Knows all the tricks and he breaks all the laws
Plays his first hand, no matter what it shows
Been chasing that dragon but it's trying to pause

Know that the worry, know that the pain
Know that the sorrow, know that the stain
They all wash away like a summer rain

I've seen the needle and the damage done
I feel peaceful, I was savage one
These damage sons, their brandish guns
Tonight's top story: if it bleeds, it runs
The flies, and it dies in the firey flame
They broadcast live and they weed out your name
They'll say you're a hero, and call it a shame
But that doesn't do zero to dissolve the pain
So you turn to the needle, and recall the vein
It's on a game, it's all a chain
The drugs and the lies and the doubt and the fear
They're all on the rise, and I wish you were here, cause

Know that the worry, know that the pain
Know that the sorrow, know that the stain
They all wash away like a summer rain

Uptown girl, downtown law
Eyes so classy, your skin so soft
Ass so fine, you're so so lost
Chasin' that dragon, no matter the cost
Dreams been shattered, a hope's been tossed
Her car keys breaking, her fingers stay crossed
It's hard as a stone, cold as a frost
Scared to the bone, she's alone and lost, but

Know that the worry, know that the pain
Know that the sorrow, know that the stain
They all wash away like a summer rain
