I know it ain't right
In the evenings shivering light

It's just so
A few hours left to go

Circumstances cut us short
Hold on just a little more
Did not work out the way we planned
It slipped right out of my hand

It's true
Nobody loved you like I do
(They don't loved you like I do)
And it ain't over, no
It ain't over now I know
(It ain't over now I know)

And the sun that's setting tonight
Might be the last one that we'll see
But we'll get just another sunrise
'Cause we won't spleep tonight
Girl, we won't sleep tonight

For sure, it' getting late, I should be going
Here comes hard times, girl, and the dark clouds will keep growin'

Circumstances cut us short
Baby, just a little more
Minutes keep on passing by
Don't speak, girl, we'll be all right

And the sun that's setting tonight
Might be the last one that we'll see
But we'll get just another sunrise
'Cause we won't sleep tonight
No, we won't sleep tonight

And the sun that's setting tonight
Might be the last one that we'll see
But we'll get just another sunrise
'Cause we won't sleep tonight
No, we won't sleep tonight
