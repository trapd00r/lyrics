Yesterday has come and gone
And we can't forget it
Anyway, we try

Take the ride
If we get divided, you and I can't fight it
March along, help me stay in time

We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?
Will you ever learn you're not the only one?
Everybody's got something to hide
Yeah, I got mine

Your love may change
But time'll be the only thing you'll save
Don't blame yourself, there's no religion inside them

What can't be learned is trained
Once you find the end, you start again
Just observe the lights that lead the way

We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?
Will you ever learn you're not the only one?
Everybody's got something to hide
And I live with mine

Everyday we come along
But it's coming anyway
You can take the wall down
We've still got nothing on the moon
Everybody knows that
No one really knows at all

And that may never change
But I don't mind

We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?

We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?

Everyday we come along, but it's coming anyway
You can take the wall down
We've still got nothing on the moon
Everybody knows that
No one really knows at all
No one really knows at all

That may never change, but I don't mind
