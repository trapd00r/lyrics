I hope we lay down by the water
Lay me down in dreams by your side
Cross my hands over your heart
I want you to know that I'm the greatest

-There's my heart
On your wandering road
Leave me not
Running wild and alone
Raise my eyes
To your eyes
Watch you die out from what's inside
Watch you fly out from what's inside-

So here we go drowning

Dress me in my favorite memory
Touch me and forget it for me
In forgetting getting something else
That you can only lose again

There's more to me
Than this quiet storm
Laid down low
Raging wild and alone
Your lazy eye
In which my lazy orbit lies
Loosen my mind

Here we go

Here we go drowning
