It's easy to feel like you're all alone
To feel like nobody knows
How great that you are
The good that's inside you
Is trying so hard to break through

Maybe it's your time to lift off and fly
You won't know if you never try
I will be there with you all of the way
You'll be fine

Don't let anyone tell you
That you're not strong enough
Don't give up
There's nothing wrong with just being yourself
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speak your mind and make some noise... and sing...
Hey! Hey! Make some noise!
Hey! Hey yeah!

You want to be known
You want to be heard
You know you are beautiful
You have so much to give
Some change you wanna live
So shout it out and let it show

You have a diamond inside of your heart
A light that shines bright as the stars
Don't be afraid to be all that you are
You'll be fine

Don't let anyone tell you
That you're not strong enough
Don't give up
There's nothing wrong with just being yourself
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speak your mind and make some noise... and sing...
Hey! Hey! Make some noise!
Hey! Hey yeah!

You can't just sit back and watch the world change
It matters what you've got to say
There's no one else who can stand in your place
So come on quit playing games

Maybe it's your time to lift off and fly
You won't know if you never try

Don't let anyone tell you
That you're not strong enough
Don't give up
There's nothing wrong with just being yourself
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speak your mind and make some noise... and sing...
Hey! Hey! Make some noise!
Hey! Hey yeah!
