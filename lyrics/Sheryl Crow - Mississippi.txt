Every step of the way
We walk the line
Your days are numbered
So are mine
Time is piling up
We struggle and we scrape
All boxed in
Nowhere to escape

The city's just a jungle
More games to play
I'm trapped in the heart of it
Trying to get away
I was raised in the country
Been working in the town
I been in trouble since I
Set my suitcase down

I ain't got nothing for you
I had nothing before
Don't even have anything
For myself anymore
Sky's full of fire
And the rain is pouring down
There's nothing you can sell me
So I'll see you around

All my powers of expression
And thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice
Reason or rhyme
Wel, there's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

The devil's in the alley
Mule kickin' in the stall
Say anything you wanna
I've heard it all
I was thinking about the things that she said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in your bed

Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things we never will undo
I know you're sorry, well I'm sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind

Well I got here, following the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
There's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship's been split to splinters; it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for those who've sailed with me

Everybody's moving if they ain't already there
Everybody's got to move somewhere
Well stick with me baby, anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

My clothes are wet, they're tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

The emptiness is endless, cold as clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
Well there's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Yeah, the only thing that I did wrong
Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long
The only thing that I did wrong
Was stayed in Mississippi a day too long
