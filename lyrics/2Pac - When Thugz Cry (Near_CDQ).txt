Intro:
When Thugz Cry
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake 
I pray to Lord my soul to take
Got us dyin'
When Thugz Cry
Times is hard

Verse One:
Born thuggin' and lovin'
The way I came up, big money clutchin' 
Bustin' while evadin' cocaine bust
My po's rushin'
To my cushin' into insanity
They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family
These cowards wanna see me buried, 
I aint worried
I got a loan on the D.A. cause I'm fuckin' the secretary

I black out, start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panicin', bitches duckin'
I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
Probably be an old man before I understand
Why I had to live my life with pistols close in hand
Kidnapped my homie sister cut her face up bad
The even raped her so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out on every block
The puttin hits on the politicians even cops
I ain't lyin', they got me sleeping' with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear muthafuckas screamin'
What's the meanin'?
When thugz cry

Chrous:
Oh why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
When they die
Let the rocks cry out
When thugz cry
Dear God
(when thugz cry)
Oh why
Does it have to be this way Ahh
children of today won't stay by
(when thugz cry)
Let the children hear 
When thugz cry
Dear God
Oh why
(Ha)

Verse two:
Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
Where is the love, never quit my ambitions to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary 
Niggers I used to love enclosed in penitentiaries
Still homie keep it real, how does it feel?
To loose your life over something that you did as a kid
you all alone no communication, block on the phone
Don't get alone with your pops and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in this song
To help us grow in time but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters to niggers and bitches
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
But somethin' change in this dirty game
Everything strange, lost all my homies over cocaine, Man
See they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See, you gotta get high or die
Cause even thugz cry

Chorus:
Oh why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
(when thugz cry)
When they die
(We don't shed a tear, she shed blood)
Let the rocks cry out
When thugz cry
(Do you still wanna be a thug)
Dear God
Oh why
Does it have to be this way Ahh
Children of today won't stay by
Let the children hear
When thugz cry
Dear God 
Oh why

Verse three:
And all I see are these paranoid bitches, illegal inventions
Bustin' muthafuckas with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
Cause in my criminal mind nobody violates the Don
I write your name on a piece of paper, and now your family's gone
Well perpetrate like you could handle my team
So merciless in mind try to take command of your dreams
Leavin' muthafuckas drownin' in they own blood
Clown and takin' pictures
Later laugh at the punk bitches that turned snitches
Regulate my area the terror I represent 
Make your people disapear, your wonderin' where they went 
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to the streets
Never found true peace I'm told
Come take my body, God
Don't let me suffer any longer 
Smoke a pound of marijuana so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery?
Is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes
When thugz cry

Chorus:
Oh why
Should you send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk
(I shed tattoo tearz for years)
When they die
Let the rocks cry out
(To my dead homeboyz and the prison peace)
When thugz cry
Dear God 
Oh why
(Yall ain't never heard my bries, nigga, what about if you would die)
Does it have to be this way Ahh
Children of today won't stay by
Let the children hear
When thugz cry
Dear God
