[Intro: Scary, Ginger]
Hahaha
Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!)
I wanna really, really, really wanna "zig-a-zig", ah

[Verse 1: Sporty, Baby, Scary, Ginger]
If you want my future, forget my past
If you wanna get with me, better make it fast
Now don't go wasting my precious time
Get your act together, we could be just fine

[Pre-Chorus: Scary, Ginger]
I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!)
I wanna really, really, really wanna "zig-a-zig", ah

[Chorus: All, Baby]
If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
(Gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is

[Verse 2: Sporty, Baby, Scary, Ginger, (Posh)]
Oh what you think about that, now you know how I feel
Say you could handle my love, are you for real?
(Are you for real?)
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try
If you really bug me, then I'll say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus: Scary, Ginger]
Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!), I wanna (Hey!)
I wanna really, really, really wanna "zig-a-zig", ah

[Chorus: All, Baby, Scary]
If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
(Gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
(You've got to give)
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is

[Verse 3: Scary, Ginger, All]
So here's a story from A to Z
You wanna get with me, you gotta listen carefully
We got Em in the place who likes it in your face
We got G like MC who likes it on an-
Easy V doesn't come for free, she's a real lady
And as for me, haha, you'll see
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around

[Chorus: All, Baby, Scary]
If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
(Gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
(You've got to give)
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is

[Outro: All, Scary]
If you wanna be my lover
(You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta slam)
Make it last forever
(Slam, slam, slam, slam)
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and "zig-a-zig", ah
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
If you wanna be my lover
