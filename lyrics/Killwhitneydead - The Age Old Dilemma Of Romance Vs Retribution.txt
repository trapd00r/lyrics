Yes I’m two faced
I am smiling to put you at ease
But inside I am counting the ways to make you bleed
I never wanted it to be like this
But you took this heart and crushed it with your fist
Now my thoughts are slowly tearing you apart – piece by piece
I’ve never felt so cold
I’ve never felt so alone
I’ve never felt so alive
Now we’ll leave it without words
We’ll settle this with violence
C’mon, give it all you’ve got
We’ll settle this with bullets
Go ahead, take your best shot
