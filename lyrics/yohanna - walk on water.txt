I'm feeling stronger
Higher than the moon
Bigger than the skies

I'll beg your pardon
If you want me to
I will even try
Or I could run away and hide from you
'Cause you believe I'm someone else
It's impossible this rollercoaster ride

refrain:
It's like walking on water
Or people throwing stones at you
And they don't know what you're going through
As a matter of fact

refrain2:
It's like hanging on a wire
With everybody pushing you
And they don't know what you're gonna do
As you fall to the ground

I get excited
And then I have to stop
And start all over

You make it harder
For me to be myself
Forget somebody else
Should I run away and hide from you
Or do the things you want me to
On this miracle rollercoaster ride

refrain

refrain2

I don't wanna drown
In the tears of a clown

refrain

refrain2

Walking on water
It's like hanging on a wire

(Oh right)
refrain
