(King Tech)
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake-Up Show!

(RZA)
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his true-a fancy a shag wee burners

(Tech N9NE)
When I woke up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin' MC's lipless
On the Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling, "Tech N9NE's filled!"

(Eminem)
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white-out
'Cause y'all can't see me, like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout,
"Hey that's my couch, bitch!"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hos worse than flippin' a convertible
Nose first with the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

(Xzibit)
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can wake up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high noon to the full moon

(Pharoahe Monch)
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled off, sawed off shotgun blast,
He asked why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

(Kool G Rap)
I sway the tech with the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas meet the tray, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate

(Jayo Felony)
What? Sway can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do with it
Tech can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do with it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what!

(Chino XL)
Yo, yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
With style filed for sexual harrassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're whack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin' with Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

(KRS-One)
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin' with the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin' to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!
Fresh, for 99 you suckas
