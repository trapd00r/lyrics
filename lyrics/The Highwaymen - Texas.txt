Listen to my song,
And if you wanna sing along,
It's about where I belong:
Texas.

Sometimes far into the night,
And until the morning light,
I pray with all my might,
To be in Texas.

It's where I wanna be.
The only place for me.
Where my spirit can be free:
Texas.

(Instrumental break.)

It's where I wanna be.
The only place for me.
Where my spirit can be free:
Texas.

Listen to my song,
And if you wanna sing along,
It's about where I belong:
Texas.
