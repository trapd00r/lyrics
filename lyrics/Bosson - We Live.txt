(Chorus:)
We Live and we die
and we learn to find
the things we live and die for (repeat)

I don't wanna be an ordinary man
No I don't wanna be as neat as a new pin
I don't care about just being safe and calm
And the time that we have inside it keeps on
ticking, till the end So it's time that we live our
lives and celebrating

I don't wanna be a worker everyday
No I don't wanna be a boss that you obey
I don't care about what people might just say
And the time that we have inside it keeps on
ticking, till the end So it's time that we live our
lives and celebrating

(Chorus)

I don't wanna say I didn't take the chance
I don't wanna say I never learned the dance
I wanna be someone, someone they show respect
GIve it all up for a little li li life
GIve it all up for a little li li life

And the time that we have inside it keeps on ticking
till the end
So it's time that we live our lives and celebrating

(Chorus)

life is all to short to spend on doing boring things,
and I want and I want I want to have fun

Holding on to be the one I am
Holding on to be the one I am...

(Chorus)
