In a West End town
A dead end world
The East End boys
And West End girls

Sometimes, you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant, in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down, underground
To a dive bar, in a West End town

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
West End girls

Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If? When? Why? What?
How much have you got?
Have you got it? Do you get it? If so, how often?
Which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh, West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End girls
West End girls
West End girls
West End girls

Girls
West End girls
And East End boys
(How much do you need?)

You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone?
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future and we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How much do you need?)

In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh, West End town, a dead end world
East End boys, West End girls
West End girls
West End girls
West End girls

Girls
West End girls
And East End boys
And West End girls
Girls
West End girls
And East End boys
And West End girls
