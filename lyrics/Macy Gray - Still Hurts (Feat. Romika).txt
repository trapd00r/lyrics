Looks like things ain't gonna work out
Quite the way we planned
Got your bags at the door
And now you're leaving me again

I play cool like I don't care
That's just the way I am
But inside I wish I had the nuts
To ask you for another chance

'Cause all I do is wish for you
Now that you are gone
Time should heal
And pain should fade
And I should move on

But it still hurts, it still burns
When it comes to loving I've got a lot to learn
You ain't coming back like I want you to
But baby, there's no getting over you
And I still hurt, yes, I still hurt

I smile when I look back
On the way we were before
Remember the life I had in love
When I was your girl

Nowhere was as lovely
As our own little world
I can't believe I messed up
I can't believe I'm not your girl

'Cause all I do is dream of you
Now that you are gone
Time should heal
And pain should fade
And I should move on

It still hurts, it still burns
When it comes to loving I've got a lot to learn
You ain't coming back like I want you to
But baby, there's no getting over you
And I still hurt, yes, I still hurt

I try to fight away
This hold you have on me
I pray, I kick, I scream
Baby, I've tried everything

But I'm hopeless, you see
Stuck on a love that used to be
Chasing a dream that maybe
Baby, you would come back to me

But it still hurts, it still burns
When it comes to loving I've got a lot to learn
You ain't coming back like I want you to
But baby, there's no getting over you
And I still hurt, yes, I still hurt

But it still hurts, yes, it still burns
When it comes to loving I've got a lot to learn
You ain't coming back like I want you to
But baby, there's no getting over you
Yes, I still hurt, yes, I still hurt
