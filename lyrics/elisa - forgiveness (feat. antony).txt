I’m lost and scared to live this life 
I thought I’d always be strong 
This rage this dark side I don’t want to feel 
lays there... lays there… lays there...

There on the bottom inside looking lost like a child 
but I know that you’re mine
we only need...

Forgiveness our key to the world 
Forgiveness I’m frightened to deserve
Forgiveness all that we need
it’s Forgiveness I am not sure I know...

It was the love untaught trapped in your mind 
so empty with me...
A silent stone that struck my heart while I looked for a sign a sign...

You felt the pain you felt the fear
but you chose not to see
made it your destiny, is it time for...

Forgiveness... for we have paid
Forgiveness is our key to the world
Forgiveness for the love untaught
It’s Forgiveness I’ll be... waiting for...

Forgiveness... for we have paid
Forgiveness is our key to the world
Forgiveness for the love untaught
It’s Forgiveness I’ll be... waiting for...
