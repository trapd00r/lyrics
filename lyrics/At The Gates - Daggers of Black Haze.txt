Masked in merciful weakness
A tribute of ritual prey
The frozen surface cracks
Dressed in iconic grace
Bottomless the void veiled in smoke
Floods the pit of dreams
The martyrdom of perfection
A phantom construction dead

The anesthesia of repetition
Let monotony and isolation reign
Will our persistence fade like daggers?
(Daggers) daggers of black haze

Mute now, the anthems and dogmas
Cynicism reproduced
The reliefs watch unseen
In winding and rigid shapes
An ideology solidified
The fragments lost in time
From within inaccessible walls
Their elitism starves us blind

Unending eyes, they watch unseen
Starving for themselves in me

Masked in merciful weakness
A tribute of ritual prey
The frozen surface cracks

Mute now, the anthems and dogmas
Cynicism reproduced
The reliefs they watch unseen

Will our persistence fade like daggers?
(Daggers) daggers of black haze

(Daggers) daggers of black haze

(Daggers, daggers) daggers of black haze
