Shining light 
Another day turns into night
Eternal fire 
Waited all my life

Take me away 
A million miles away from here
Take me away
Find a place for you and me
You're taking me higher
High as I could be
Take me away
Forever you and me
Take me away

Tears I cried
Kept them all inside
I needed time
To make up my mind
(To make up my mind)

Take me away 
A million miles away from here
Take me away 
Find a place for you and me
You're taking me higher
High as I could be
Take me away
Forever you and me 
Take me away

Tears I cried
Kept them all inside
I needed time
To make up my mind
(To make up my mind)

Take me away
A million miles away from here
Take me away 
Find a place for you and me
You're taking me higher
High as I could be
Take me away
Forever you and me 
Take me away
