Truthfully you
you helped me find at last.
Truthfully we
are finding out what's true.
And Truthfully I am finding out what's you.

Surprise, cause I was flying the plane.

Surprise, cause you showed up with your parachute.
Surprise, I'm kind of happy you showed up.

Truthfully I
I'm finding finally.
Truthfully you

but the last thing that I want to do is to tell you that I'm right for you.

Truthfully I
I'm finding finally.
Truthfully you
you helped me find at last.
Truthfully we
are finding out what's true.
And Truthfully I am finding out what's you.

I'm finding finally.
Truthfully, I'm finding out what's you.
I'm smiling again.
Truthfully
