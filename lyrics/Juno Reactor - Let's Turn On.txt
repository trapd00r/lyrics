In the middle of nowhere
Gravity
No longer necessary
Am I awake or asleep?
I hear a voice calling
Follow me
Follow me
Follow me
In the mind of the free
In the mind of the free
Follow
Follow me
In the mind of the
Free
Free

Strange kind of landscape
Like in the tree
In the middle of nowhere
Gravity is no longer necessary
I hear a voice calling
Follow me
Follow
Follow me
Follow me
In the mind of the free
Free
We like to be
Follow me
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ay, ay, ay
