It's 50 a.k.a Ferrari F-50 
Break it down 
I got a lot of living to do before I die 
And I ain't got tyme to waste 
Let's make it 

You said you a gansta but you neva pop nuttin' 
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin' 
You ain't a friend of mine, (yeah) 
You ain't no kin of mine, (nah) 
What makes you think that I wont run up on you with the nine 
We do this all tha tyme, right now we on tha grind 
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes 
Shorty she so fyne, I gotta make her mine 
A ass like that gotta be one of a kind 
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every line 
I'm fuckin with they mind 
I make 'em press rewind 
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme 
Been on parole since 94 cause I commit tha crime 
I send you my line, I did it three ta nine 
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes 

You said you a gangsta 
But you neva pop nuttin 
We said you a wanksta 
And you need to stop frontin' 
You go to the dealership 
But you neva cop nuttin' 
You been hustlin a long tyme 
And you ain't got nuttin 

You said you a gangsta

Damn Homie, in high school you was tha man, homie 
What tha fuck happened to you? 
I got tha sickest vendetta when it come to tha chedda 
And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta 
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta 
I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do betta 
She look good but I know she after my chedda 
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her 
Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet 
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step 
Guerilla unit cuz they say we bugged out 
Cuz we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta 
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me 
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta 
But it's me you see on your TV 
Cuz I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy 
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy 
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets 
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat 
Niggas sayin they goin murd' 50, how? 
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow 
What you know about AK's and AR 15's? 
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh
