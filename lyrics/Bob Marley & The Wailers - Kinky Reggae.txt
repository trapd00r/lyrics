Ah ah

I went downtown
I saw Miss Brown
She had brown sugar
All over her booga-wooga
I think I might join the fun
But I had to hit and run
See I just can't settle down
In a kinky part of town
Ride on

Down there I saw Marcus
He had a candy tart
All over his chocolate bar
I think I might join the fun
But I had to hit and run
See I just can't settle down
In a kinky kinky part of town
Nice one, that's what they say
But I'm a leaving you today
