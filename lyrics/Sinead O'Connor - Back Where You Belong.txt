Oh, it's hard to be a boy
When all the men have lost their joy
And they can't find the ones they left behind

Harder still to think of being a man
In this world of no lessons or love
It's only war that men be thinking of

Should you stay or should you come down with me?
Is that the question you're asking of me?
And do you think that you can take the answer as it tells
You have to wear life well?

Come down with me
Come when you need me
But for now I want you to be happy

Sometimes life does things to you
That will hurt you and confuse you
But when you look behind you're sure to find

I am with you though I can't come with you
I am in you and I'm always part of you
And all you ever have to do
To bring me to you

Is come down with me
Come when you need me
But for now I want you to be happy

So you must go back home
That's where you belong
You must go back home

You must go back home
That's where you belong
You must go back home
And I can't come along
