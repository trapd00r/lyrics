I've got a room here at the Mandalay Bay
I'll take a shower then I'm on my way
I'll bring a friend if someone picks a fight
Here in Las Vegas tonight
 
It's close to midnight when I hit The Strip
The maiden voyage on my Vegas trip
The night is young and everything's all right
Here in Las Vegas tonight
 
Dancing girls and cabarets
You can spend your money in a million ways
Let's have a ball
The winner takes it all
 
In Las Vegas, in the neon lights
You'll be a star if you do it right
In Las Vegas, oh oh oh...
You better hold on tight
 
In Las Vegas, can't believe your eyes
Your luck can turn in a throw of a dice
In Las Vegas, oh oh oh...
You better hold on tight
Here in Las Vegas tonight
 
I'm leaving with a million dollar smile
The hotel manager can check my file
Fred the limo driver's asking polite:
"Leaving Las Vegas tonight?"
 
Dancing girls and cabarets
You can spend your money in a million ways
Let's have a ball
The winner takes it all
 
In Las Vegas, in the neon lights
You'll be a star if you do it right
In Las Vegas, oh oh oh...
You better hold on tight
 
Hey, yeah, yeah...
(In Las Vegas)
In Las Vegas
 
In Las Vegas, in the neon lights
You'll be a star if you do it right
(In Las Vegas) Oh oh oh...
You better hold on tight
 
In Las Vegas, can't believe your eyes
Your luck can turn in a throw of a dice
In Las Vegas, oh oh oh...
You better hold on tight
Here in Las Vegas tonight
