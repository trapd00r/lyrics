Hey...

We are old,
We are young,
We are in this together

Hey...

We are old,
We are young,
We are in this together
Vagabonds and children,
Prisoners forever!
With pulses aragen
And eyes full of wonder
Kick it out
Behind us again

Hey...

We are old,
We are young,
We are in this together

We are old,
We are Young,
We are in this together

Hey...
