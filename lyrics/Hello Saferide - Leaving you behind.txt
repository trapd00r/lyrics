How I wish you'd lied, or had been untrue
That you hadn't said: "It's always you."
How I wish you hadn't held me all those lonely, lonely nights!
Makes me wonder, makes me wonder why I'm leaving you behind

And I know I'm going to see you down town
With a pretty girl, and you'll be holding hands
You'll both be laughing, and she will be wondering the same as me:
Was I crazy?
You know I've got to be crazy for leaving you behind

I'm such a worthless being
Ruining all we've got for
some kind of feeling that there's more than this
How I wish there was more than there is
