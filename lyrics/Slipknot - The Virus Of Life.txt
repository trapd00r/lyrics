(Yeah)

I can see you, but you can't see me
I could touch you and you wouldn't even feel me
Wait a second and you'll settle down
I'm just waiting till you really let your guard down
You're relaxed, you're sublime, you're amazing
You don't even know the danger you're facing
If I'm quiet, I'll slide up behind you
And if you hear me, I'll enjoy trying to find you

I've been with you all day
I'm trying to stay calm
I'm impatient and it's really hard to breathe
I'm going to empty you and fill you in with me

Just keep the violence down
Not yet, don't make a sound
Oh, God, I'm feeling it
It's reaching fever pitch
My skin is caving in
My heart is driving out
No mercy, no remorse
Let nature take its course

(Watching) Bring me to my knees
(Waiting) I am your disease
(Lover) Set my symptom free
(Covered) You can't stop me

(Wait, no, wait, wait, no, wait, wait, not yet, no wait, wait)

I'm sweating through my veins
I'm trying to hold on
It's unbearable; it's almost worst for me
I'm gonna tear you apart and make you see
Make you see

(Watching) Bring me to my knees
(Waiting) I am your disease
(Lover) Set my symptom free
(Covered) You can't stop me

This is the virus, the virus of life
This is inside us, the crisis, the knife
This is the virus, the virus of life
This is inside us, the crisis, the knife

It's almost time to play
It's time to be afraid
I can't control the pain
I can't control in vain
Oh, God, I'm ready now
You're almost ready now
I'm gonna love you now
I'm gonna put you down
I see you in the dark
I see you all the way
I see you in the light
I see you plain as day
I wanna touch your face
I wanna touch your soul
I wanna wear your face
I wanna burn your soul

(Watching) Bring me to my knees
(Waiting) I am your disease
(Lover) Set my symptom free
(Covered) You can't stop me

This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life

This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life
This is the virus, the virus of life
