I can't leave the house without my lipstick on
(Lipstick on, lipstick on)
It's like a runaway show
Monroe, yeah Marlyn you would be proud, honey you would be
Sweet dreams are made of these
And violator playing on repeat
I push the pedal like a movie scene
I'll be the bad girl
You know that I'll get away
Baby come catch me
'Cause really I ain't

Superficial
You know it
You know it
You know it
I think about you all the time
My love is something money can't buy
Don't tell me that I'm superficial

He's got the lacquered hair
The blackest lashes
Honey hold that stare
Inside your eyes I could go anywhere
Straight from the alley to your daddy's jet
Honey come on now
Tattoos and motorbikes
We riding faster in the dead of night
Guess I'm a sucker for those 
Black pearls
We could be timeless
Yeah you could be my best friend
Boy you're my diamond
Don't tell me that I'm

Love boys
Love boats
