Darkness, if I’m gonna spend
All my time with you
You’ve got to be my friend
If I wanna be all alone with you
I’ve got to feel your hand

And whenever we see light outside
We’ve got to let it in
And we must spare
A room for love, you know
If it’d ever find its way in

Yeah? Okey. Yeah? Okey.

And tell me then what I can do for you
Since I’ll be yours most of the time
I won’t be in the way you know
I’ve got things on my mind

Yeah? Okey. Yeah? Okey.

I’ll take the walks with you
I’ll have the talks with you
Just save me from my crazy mind

Yeah? Okey. Yeah? Okey.

And darkness, I want you to tell me
You can never be hurt
I go to be somewhere, you know
With no one to desert

Yeah? Okey. Yeah? Okey.
Yeah? Okey. Yeah? Okey.
