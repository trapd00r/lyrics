Humidity's rising
Barometer's getting low
According to all sources
The street's the place to go
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men.

It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen! OW!

It's gonna start raining men.

It's raining men!  Hallelujah!
It's raining men!  Amen
I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna let myself get,
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took on a heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

It's raining men!
Spoken:  Go get yourself wet girl, I know you want to.

I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin
Hear the thunder don't you loose your head.
Rip off the roof and stay in bed!

It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!

It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!

It's raining men, it's raining men,
It's raining men, it's raining men,
It's raining men, it's raining men,
It's raining men, it's raining men
