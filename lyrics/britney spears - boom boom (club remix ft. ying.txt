I see you looking my way and I know that 
You have something to say 
Watching every inch of my body 
Like you wanted to play 
(So here we go)

Boom boom

I begin to dance just a little bit (uh)
To turn you on

I got that boom boom 
That you want 
What you need all night long 
Hurry up before it's gone 
I got that boom boom 
That you want 
I don't think you should wait 
One minute might be too late 

Whoo-hooo

And I wanted to get to know you 
Don't be shy 
I want you to come closer

She think she fine 
Fine enough to blow your mind 
Shorty 
She think she bad 
Get on the floor and shake that ass 
Shorty

Fine enough to blow your mind

She think she bad 
Get on the floor and shake that ass

She naked 
She soaking wet 
Strip tease like a mmm 
Drip, sweat 
She got a little body that I can't forget 
I ain't met a young lady that outdid her yet 
Britney Spears and the Ying Yang Twins 
Wazup, ha 
We all became friends 
Might as well let the party begin 
If you're ready then jump on in 

Shorty 
She think she fine 
Fine enough to blow your mind 
Shorty 
She think she bad 
Get on the floor and shake that ass 
Shorty 
She think she fine 
Fine enough to blow your mind 
Shorty 
She think she bad 
Get on the floor and shake that ass
