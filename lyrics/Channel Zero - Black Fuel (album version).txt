We gotta slow down the speed
The less we have is the more you need
We gotta cut off the speed
While the engines burn beneath our feet

We're running out of the fuel
It's hard to find like jewel
We're running out of the fuel
Black fuel's the master making rules
Black fuel controls the world

We stand backs to the wall
And being slaves after all
We stand backs to the wall
Till the never ending story falls

And then one day you'll see
We messed it up so let it be
And then one day we'll see
There's nothing left internally
Black fuel controls the world

Every minute that we move
Black fuel's being used
Depending all the time always
More water in the wine
While I'm sitting in my room
Patiently waiting for the boom
Black fuel
