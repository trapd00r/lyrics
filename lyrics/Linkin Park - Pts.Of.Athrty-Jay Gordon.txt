Yo, yo, forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame

Cover up your face
You can't run the race
The pace is too fast
Just won't last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the
Awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think you're never wrong
(You like to think you're never wrong)
You have to act like you're someone
(You have to act like you're someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

You love the things I say Iâll do
The way Iâll hurt myself again
Just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

You like to think youâre never wrong
(You like to think youâre never wrong)
You have to act like youâre someone
(You have to act like youâre someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

Yo, yo, forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame

Cover up your face
You canât run the race
The pace is too fast
You just wonât last

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame

Cover up your face
You canât run the race
The pace is too fast
You just wonât last

You like to think youâre never wrong
You have to act like youâre someone
(You have to act like youâre someone)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through

You like to think youâre never wrong
(You like to think youâre never wrong)
You have to act like youâre someone
(You have to act like youâre someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
