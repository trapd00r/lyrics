Denn unser Geschlecht
Es gleicht dem harten Metall
Daraus es schmiedet weltbeherrschende Wunder
Durch seine Adern rollt
In seines Armes Muskel
Bäumt sich unbiegsam ehrene Kraft
Und jegliches wagt es
Sich vermessend
Titanhaft trotzig
Unmögliches kühn zu vollbringen

I sleep the sleep of the hermit
I found a safe place up above the world
Where no one can really hear my song or read my lips
I roam in my thoughts
I visit the fires
But I stay away if there's people
I only ever mingle
To be a stranger among them
I've seen what they done to the city
And it is me guarding that flame now
As I sleep the sleep of the hermit
As I eat the bread of the vile
Up above the world for no one to know

To remain complete a man must at all times at all costs
Keep some part of himself beyond
Beyonf this life
Beyond the laughter and the tears

Outside as the complete outsider
