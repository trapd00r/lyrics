[IQ] 
Your fakeness is atrocious 
post is deep in your hypnosis 
then focus 
roll this 
and smoke this     
like L's 
of that bomb-ass herb thats gaurenteed to rock bells 
a hiphop refugee like Praswell 
Travelin citys 
pimpin babblin biddys 
game trump tight and solidified 
comupterized 
to get rid of spies 
know what I do to guys 
shootin and spittin lies 
I'm banished in exisdence 
vanishin any instences 
brandishin sentences 
proovin repentences 
the only way to see me, dont miss these 
me and my crew smoke so many trees that 
I piss leaves 
never _my bitch please 
but keep smokin my system, roll blunts it's all tight 
on an off night 
I still smoke like exaust pipes 
and bust a universal flow 
and blow your wig back like niggas with toupe's 
drivin a convertable 
and further more 
I run the board 
your shit is played and the way you fell off you coulnt bounce 
back with a bungee cord 

 Not the lyrics to "Bring Our Boys" ?, Please report that below. 
[Chorus] 
Bring your boys in 
we can bring the noise in 
YOU DON'T WANNA FUCK WITH DIRTY DOZEN 
[repeat 4 times]  

[Bizarre] 
My crew is like a maze 
put fear like ex-slaves 
who wanna step to this microphone and think that they brave 
dozen always startin the fuckin beef 
I don't care if your from Kansas I'm killin the fuckin chief 
back the fuck up I'm releasin my dumb-dumbs 
tell your whore stop pagin me 9 1 1 
I'm the star 
that they call Bizarre 
smokin blunts with Mel Far (??) 
in my brand new car 
_wanna see me 
even if I was in Arizona I'd still request iced tea 
Bizarre don't give a shit about you 
on top of the mountain ain't nothin your bitch-ass crew 
can do 
sick emcee that they call Peter 
treat your crew like an unexpected meter 
reader 
fuckin more shit than Howard Corsell 
Butt-fuckin Jassabells 
in nasty hotels 

 If you can not find the lyrics you want, You may want to request them. 
[Chorus] 
 [Proof] 
How you think your crew sound compared to this 
it's the team that your entire clique scared to diss 
demandin attention when the glock sound 
y'all niggas to be murdered like Jeffery Daumer on lock down 
I'm brown like Bobby, pullin hoe's like whitney 
Take your title, kill your moms so you won't forget me 
lips sealed nigga I might blow important plots 
whoever fronts is gettin done like Micheal Jordan's pops 
sure I'm number one translator my fame dirty D 
y'all niggas gettin hung like this was 1933 
got word of me 
now flee 
cause you don't got a chance 
death is 3 easy steps so now we gotta dance 
so look away 
dont play 
with the style master 
I love killin beef so I kill a whole cow pasture 
lyrically I'm sick, ill everything but sober 
my nickle plate pack the _ jackin fool get fucked over

[Eminem] 
Dirty Dozen is the clique that I'll run right over and lynch ya
ripped the ass right out ya pants like a Dovermin Pincha 
like the cobra and ninja 
my intentions to injure 
and prevent ya 
from enterin from the edge of my center 
or get your muthafuckin pants split at the creases 
fuckin you intelectually givin you menatly sexually transmited diseases 
my duty is to keep a strange abard (??) 
I guard my sector like a Saint Bernard 
and this ain't the yard 
Bringin the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger 
droppin your whole clique with one finger 
til none linger 
beware of my dogs attackin like a pack of Great Danes 
chargin like freight trains 
through the great plains 

 
[Chorus]
