Come on up
Come on up
Come on up
Last night as I lay dreamin'
This stranges kinda feelin'
Reviled its secret meaning
And no I know
I've never ever been to paradise
I never ever seen no angels eyes
No never ever left this magic die
No mater where you are, you are my lucky star
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
No mater where you are
You are my lucky star
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
No mater where you are
You are my lucky star
Na na na na na na, na na na na na
No mater where you are
You are my lucky star
Come on up
