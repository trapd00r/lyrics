Chorus:
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Sayin' good bye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood

B/W Chorus:
Hollywood
Why do I feel this way?

Verse #1:
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself laying on my knees in cuffs 
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't see this shit myself? It's just me
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me - the minute she was heated she just bailed
I'm standin and swingin on like 30 people by myself
I couldnt even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold 2 million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
So for now I'm...

(Chorus)

Verse #2:
Bury my face in comic books cuz I dont wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I pro'lly should, these problems are pilin' at once
Cuz everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank god I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father and not alotta good
I'd be to my daughter layin in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood, cuz I dunno how I do it
All I know is I dont want to follow in the footsteps of my dad
Cuz I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growing up to be like his fuckin ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm...

(Chorus)

Verse #3:
I dont wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is sick
This is not a game this fame in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, consume my fuckin dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood, or mask
What about math? How come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from bein' a no one to seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up MCin'
It's fuckin crazy, cuz all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
Instead I forced us to live alienated
So i'm sayin'...

(Chorus)

Outro:
Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood (Goodybe)
Please don't cry for me (See ya later)
When im gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So, goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fucking star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)
