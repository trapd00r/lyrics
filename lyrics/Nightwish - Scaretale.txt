Once upon a time in a daymare
Dying to meet you, little child, enter enter this sideshow

Time for bed the cradle still rocks
13 chimes on a dead man's clock
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

The bride will lure you, cook you, eat you
Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear

Burning farms and squealing pigs
A pool of snakes to swim with, oh sweet poison
Bite me, bite me

"Ladies and gentlemen
Be heartlessly welcome!
To Cirque De Morgue
And what a show we have for you tonight!"

Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes
Mindless ghouls with lot of limbs to lose
Illusionsists, contortionist,
Tightrope - walkers tightening the noose

Horde of spiders, closet tentacles
Laughing harpies with their talons ripping,
sher-chrisss, per-vizzz

The pendulum still sways for you
Such are the darks here to show you, child in a corner,
fallen mirrors, all kingdom in cinders
