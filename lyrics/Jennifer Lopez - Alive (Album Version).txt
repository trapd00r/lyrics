Time... goes... slowly now, in my life
Fear... no more... of what I'm not sure

Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing
and letting go
I guess I've found my way 
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight,
and happy just to be me and be alive

Love, in and out 
of my, my heart
And though life, can be strange 
I can't be afraid

Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go
I guess I've found my way 
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight
And happy... just to be me... and being alive

I guess I've found my way 
It's simple when it's right 
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight
And happy... just to be me... and being... alive....
