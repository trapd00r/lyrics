Sweat 'til I catch a fever
Call me the illest diva (Yo I'm on fire!)
People go head and drink up

Someone to touch and rub up
Show me some love, strip off your clothes, and take off your socks

The party's jumpin, I see something fine (ooh)

Let me dance with you, let me wear you out (out)
Here's a glass of orange juice, let's go X it out (oh)
The music's bangin, way down in my soul (soul)
When you dance behind me, I lose all control (ohh)

And I got this feeling, and it's all over me (ooh)
I wanna dance with you, and lick your face (ooh)
Take me on the dance floor to feel some ecstasy
The vibe is right now, and I'm 'bout to score (score)

Can't stand when a nigga fuckin' up my plans
All night liquored up while I'm tryin to dance
Drunk, and his breath stink, freaky with his hands
Cocky with his mouth please like he got a fan
Can't stand when a bitch all in my side
I don't even know her and she all up in my light
Givin' me the side eye like she wanna fight
Philly known for boxing bitch better get it right
Can't stand when a DJ fuckin up the song
Know I'm tryna to shake my ass all night long
Cuttin' up the same shit all night long
High 'fore I got there, now my shit is blown
Can't stand when it aint jumpin like I want
Cats that try to stop my fun, take away my blunt
I don't give a fuck he aint gon' take away my fun
See him when this shit is over, make a nigga run, huh

This is for my people, my party people
This is for my people, my motherfuckin' people
C'mon (c'mon), get down (get, get on down)
C'mon (c'mon), get down (get, get on down)
This is for my people, my party people
This is for my people, my ecstasy people
C'mon (c'mon), get down (get, get on down)
C'mon (c'mon), get down (get, get on down)
