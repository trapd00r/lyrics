When, when you smile, when you smile at me
Well, well I know our love will always be
When, when you kiss, when you kiss me right
I, I don't want to ever say good night

I need you
I want you near me
I love you
Yes, I do and I hope you hear me

When, when I say, when I say "Be mine"
If, if you will I know all will be fine
When will you be mine?

(Oh, baby)
(I need you)
(I want you near me)
(I love you)
(Yes, I do and I hope you hear me when)

When, when you smile, when you smile at me
Well, well I know our love will always be
When, when you kiss, when you kiss me right
I, I don't want to ever say good night

I need you
I want you near me
I love you
Yes, I do and I hope you hear me

When, when I say, when I say "Be mine"
If, if you will I know all will be fine
When will you be mine?
