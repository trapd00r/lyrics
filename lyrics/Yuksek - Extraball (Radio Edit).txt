Now I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical

Catch that noise, better to check the sound
'Cause I break these boys and wreck this town.
I'll steal your toys and claim your ground.
I'll steal your toys and claim your ground.
Just listen, listen up! Listen, listen up!
If you in the crowd, can't get it, get it up.
Baby ask around, baby ask around.
'Cus it's my time and I stand proud.
In my hands I got it, got it
Wanna be down, it's my turn now.

Now... [x3]

Now I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now

Your time is now you're off the wall (Your time is now you're off the wall)
Stand up and get your extraball (Stand up and get your extraball)

'Cause I go hard, pound for pound
Got the voice of a sinner and I scream out loud
Listen, listen up if you in the crowd
Can't get it, get it up
Baby ask around
'Cus it's my time and I stand proud.
In my hands, I got it now
Wanna shine? Just ask me how
You wanna be down it's my turn now.

Your time is now you're off the wall (Your time is now you're off the wall)
Stand up and get your extraball (Stand up and get your extraball)

Now I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk
I need the extraball
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk (Your time is now)
I need the extraball (you off the wall)
It's purely physical
I think your time is now
I try to walk and talk (Your time is now)
I need the extraball (you off the wall)
It's purely physical
I think your time is now...

Your time is now you off the wall (Your time is now you off the wall)
Stand up and get your extraball...
