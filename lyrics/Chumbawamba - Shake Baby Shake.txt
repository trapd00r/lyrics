Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

Shake, baby, shake the memories away
(Shake it, shake it)
Shake this grown-up Barbie doll of a day
(Shake it, shake it)
She gets Hugh Hefner, but she forgets the year
She just shakes her yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

Shake the dirt from your hands now, Lisa Marie
(Shake it, shake it)
Shaking up the family with Pamela Lee
(Shake it, shake it)
Shake this fear of getting nothing done
If you can bake a cake, you can make a bomb

"Somebody forgot about something, for sure.
Something so obvious that they missed it.
It's inevitable."

"Moribund music of the 70's..."
