Refrain
Together forever for all the time
Together we welcome the secret sign
Together in freedom we take the chance
Together forever we will be friends

Refrain 2
We are what we are - Together
And we went so far - Together
We are what we are - Together
We all long for a land to be free

Verse 1
The promised land is close to you
The rain is gone, the sky is blue
Hand in hand we can survive
We're fighting for a better life

Bridge:
It's a new generation
Without hate and frustration
Promised land, promised nation
Without pain, without control

Verse 2:
Planet earth is our place
Insanity is lost in space
A world of dreams is what we share
Where honesty is in the air

Rap:
Together forever for all the time
Together we welcome the secret sign
Together in freedom we take the chance
Together forever we will be friends
