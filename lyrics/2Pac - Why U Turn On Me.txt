Old switcharoo ass bitch made mother fuckers
Just because I can bitch
Outlaw nigga, westside, throw it up, yeah
Used to have love for me. But why you turning on me?
Why me?
Westside, how you do it?
I went from, nothing to something now they all wanna see me fallin'
Playa hatas hate to see a thug nigga ballin'
They say we hate the east coast, but that's funny, got a lotta love for any nigga gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggaz tripped
It was hip-hip until Tupac fucked Biggie's bitch
Y'all niggaz hypocrites your bitch made
Now either love me or hate me, but real thug niggaz get paid
Had me catching cases all across the nation
I went from jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facing three strikes, and we might, just blast
God bless the child that can get cash
With all these niggaz turning they'll never learn
Got a long line of niggaz playa hatin' me for spittin' words
Talk a lot of shit but you'se a trick in drag
Like the mac made you fall back and stick your ass, for back stabbing

Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
(Why y'all turning on me?)
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h with the u-g
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
(Yeah nigga)
'Cause I'm a t-h with the u-g

It, started so innocent but ended in the 5th precinct
A bunch of juvenile delinquents, we still decent
Playing catching kiss, you was dissing the herbs
Fuck school we was skipping drinking drinking 5th on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinking brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, you think I'd die?
Never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Tell I got raped in jail, picture that, revenge is a pay back bitch
(Laughing)
Get your gat
Fuck (censored - Wendy Williams) and I pray that
Ya choke on the next dick down your throat
For turning on me

Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
(Why y'all turning on me? Why me?)
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h-u-g
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h-u-g

(Tupac talking)
I'll put Jenny Craig on your fat ass you fat troll
Anybody ever seen (censored - Wendy Williams) fat ass?
Why you always wearin' spandex you fat bitch? I know your pussy stink
You fat ho
I'm puttin' Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm bout to put a twenty thousand dollar hit, through Jenny Craig
To come find your ass and put you in a fat farm you fat bitch
Thuglife, outlaw, westside, bitch, it's Tupac so you know who said it
If everybody did like what I said about that other trick and Mobb Deep
Fuck you too nigga
If a nigga didn't wanna get talked about, he shouldn't of stepped in the fucking ring
If Tyson don't wanna get knocked out, he don't step in the fucking ring
That's how this shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock mother fucka's out
Well that's what Tupac gon 'do
When niggaz come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out
One way or the mother fucking other
This old mother fucking nigga in the south told me nigga
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's more than one way to shoot a gat
There's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm though, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it

Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
(Why y'all turning on me? Why me?)
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h-u-g
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
'Cause I'm a t-h-u-g
(Fuck you too nigga!)
(Laughing)
