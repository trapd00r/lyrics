Oh now is the time for your loving, dear
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry man
And now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a proud, proud land

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of a springtime mind
And once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
Oh why have the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

So, now is the time for your loving, dear
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company
