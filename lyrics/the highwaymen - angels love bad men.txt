(Cash:)
When his stolen gold has turned to rust,
He rides off in a cloud of dust,
Lookin' for a border he can cross.
She'll stand by and watch him go,
Wonderin' if he'll ever know,
The hurt she's feelin' now, and what they've lost.

(Jennings lead, the Highwaymen and backup singers:)
Angels love bad men. That's how it's always been.
They give their whole hearts when they fall.
Angels love bad men. That's how it's always been.
Love holds their hearts against the wall.

(Nelson:)
When his corporate day comes to an end,
He rides away in his Mercedes Benz.
Soon he's lost beneath the neon sky.
(Kristofferson:)
Outside of town, in their suburban home,
She spends another night alone.
Wonders what went wrong and wonders why.

(Jennings lead, the Highwaymen and backup singers:)
Angels love bad men. That's how it's always been.
They give their whole hearts when they fall.
Angels love bad men. That's how it's always been.
Love holds their hearts against the wall.
