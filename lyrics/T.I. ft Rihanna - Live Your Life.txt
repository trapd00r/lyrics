Ay, this a special what's happenin' to all my, all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here, what you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey

[Rihanna]
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna, let's get it)

So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

[T.I.]
Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away.

[Rihanna]
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay

'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life

[T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with they record sales, just holla T.I.P.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow T.I.P.
I got love for the game, but ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comical

The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
"Where you from, who you know, what you makin', what kind of car you in?"
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty

Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Rihanna]
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' away

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
'Til the game end, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, my life
In a brand new city, got my whole team wit' me
The life, my life, I do what I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life, and I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life, and I'm not stopping

So live your life
