Some go into space, to find another race
Some say it's a waste, and some, they rest their case
I've got love in my own place, to me it's a waste, this chase
I find no trace, in you, IN you

You gotta take your time, free your mind
Leaving you and me behind,
Don't you ever cross that line
To where you can't let go...

You have to open up, step inside
A universe within you'll find
You don't have to travel skies
To be aware and know

Somewhere in the haze, I remember a kiss with a taste
Remember the days, when this was a beautiful place
And through this journey in space, it's me who got me amazed
I found no values to praise, in you, in you
