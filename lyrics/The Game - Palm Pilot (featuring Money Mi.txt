Y'all can't beat me.
You'll see when you meet me.
And I'm gunna say it real clean so you niggas understand.
Fuck the Young Gunz and both of your fans.(There's 2 of them)
Somebody in your camp should've told you to stop it.
And now you two rappers gettin' fucked by a comic.
I done been to New York.
You niggas ain't a factor.
How does it feel to be dissed by an actor?
And y'all can't really diss a nigga at all (why?)
I made one fuckin' movie am I'm more famous then y'all.
And it'll take more than some Young Gunz to hurt me.
I put your mama on a stroller bitch ain't but thirty?????
Y'all just got mustaches how you gunna burn me?
Two young gay versions of bert and ernie
You don't concern me 'cause y'all ain't hot
Y'all the only girl group roc-a-fella got
Matta fact just don't say my name no more
And try to keep your CD outta the 99 cent store

'Cause you can't stop wont stop two weak motha fuckers
Who just need to sit down before you get the fuck clowned
And if I see you around Imma pimp slap you down
And leave in my gators without makin' a sound

Y'all really helped me out but y'all ain't knowing
Hey tell chris tell neefy his thong is showing (no it's not)
You need to be sign to nickalodeon you the childrens choice
Next time you say my name put some bass in your voice
Mr Carter is a pimp that's why he got the roc
And got you two lil bitches selling cock on the block
You can't stop 'cause you never started
And both of ya niggas sound plain retarded (Duh)
Why did y'all get pimpin' started
Two young girl who still get carded
One of y'all sucks and the others garbage.
It ain't no secret its common knowledge.
And I couldve let you slide but I'm to cold hearted
And I hope you man enough to realize this
You just got slapped by a fake ass pimp

'Cause you can't stop wont stop two weak motha fuckers
Who just need to sit down before you get the fuck clowned
And if I see you around Imma pimp slap you down
And leave in my gators without makin' a sound

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I just put the kids to sleep

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

(Game)
Time to wake their punk asses up

Can't stop wont stop game sitting outside
In the stock range loading the clip while pac playin'
Since he wanna drop names imma tie him up
Leave him ass naked in the hood with his roc chain
When I pull a def card your whole crew will fold
The bullets a throw have my eagles in the superbowl
You don't want me to put the fifth to your chest
Watch lil Neefy scrabble like Vick at the Tech
>From 40 yards away oh shit he can catch
Like bikini wax how they stick to his chest
I make the traffic come out
Telling what ya yappin about
Before the plastic come out
Blood runnin' out the back of your mouth
Unless you take Money Mike name and put it back in your mouth
Only thing left for you is the ash in your house
You lookin' for a young gun bring Cassidy out
Bitch (repeat)
