I'm not perfect
And I don't wanna be
But it seems like everybody has an opinion of me

And when you say I'm pretty
It feels like you're lying to me
'Cause when I look in a mirror
I don't see what's on TV

And life has it's ups and downs
Where can my heart be found
'Cause everything feels low
Is there nowhere I can go?

And I've denied my own opinion of me
And I can't look in a mirror to see me

And my white lies are coming
Like rain pouring down
To wash away this ugliness I've found
And if you had to spend
A day in my shoes
I'd like to see you walk away without feeling all blue

And life has it's ups and downs
Where can my heart be found?
'Cause everything feels low
Is there nowhere I can go?

And I've denied my own opinion of us
Is there no one I can trust?
