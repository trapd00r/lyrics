Don't be afraid if you hear voices
Or feel the sweet air spoken upon you
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words of hope will reassure
Show me the future

We'll see us joined together
If the oceans fled or the mountains sigh
Then I will keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again

Don't be afraid if you're descending the deepest despair without a handrail to guide you
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words can confuse
But when you're sleeping
They shift and slide together
Bring meaning to the canyon's cry
Oh I, I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again

Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispers are where you live a little fear,
but feel the future
Well I feel us dream together
I'll feel no fear, I'll feel no fire
Oh I, I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream
