I know how the wind blows
So straight in your ear
Soon I’ve turned it, so you won’t hear

Passing by, passing through
It will be over
As soon as I’ve passed by you

I know how the blade
So frequently scratches your skin
Soon I’ve worn it out
So it won’t go deeper in

Passing by, passing through
I’m on my way of passing you

I know how you rush
For every corner you see
Soon I’ll be gone
And your ways will be free

Passing by, passing through
A little help
I’d need to pass by you

So what I’m doing
Is to call on my heart
For some reason
The leaving is hard

Passing by, passing through
The truth is I don’t know
How to pass by you
