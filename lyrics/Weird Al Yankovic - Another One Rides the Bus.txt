Ridin' in a bus down the boulevard
And the place was pretty packed (Yeah)
Couldn't find a seat, so I had to stand
With the perverts in the back
It was smellin' like a locker room
There was junk all over the floor
We're already packed in like sardines
But we're stoppin' to pick up more
Look out

Another one rides the bus-ah
Another one rides the bus-ah
And another comes on
And another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey
He's gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

There's a suitcase pokin' me in the ribs
There's an elbow in my ear
There's a smelly old bum standin' next to me
Hasn't showered in a year
Well, I think I'm missin' a contact lens
I think my wallet's gone
And I think this bus is stoppin' again
To let a couple more freaks get on
Look out

Another one rides the bus-ah
Another one rides the bus-ah
And another comes on
And another comes on
Another one rides the bus-ah
Hey
He's gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

Another one rides the bus--ah
Another one rides the bus--ow
Another one rides the bus--hey, hey
Another one rides the bus--hey-y-y-y

The window doesn't open, and the fan is broke
And my face is turnin' blue
I haven't been in a crowd like this
Since I went to see The Who
Well, I should'a got off a couple miles ago
But I couldn't get to the door
There isn't any room for me to breathe
Now we're gonna pick up more, yeah

Another one rides the bus-ah
Another one rides the bus-ah
And another comes on
And another comes on
Another one rides the bus-ah
Hey
He's gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus
