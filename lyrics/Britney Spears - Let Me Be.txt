You try to read me.
You try to figure out.
You try to breath me,
but you can't blow me out.
You try to feel me,
but I'm so out of touch.
I wont be falling,
you won't have to pick me up.

Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

Think that I might back down
But I won't
Think that I might have doubts
But I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now
But you don't
Think that  I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be

Trust in my instincts.
Trust that I know what's right.
These are the reasons,
That keep you up at night.
Tell me go slow,
This is my floor,
Cuz you don't know,
Know what I know.
Let me tell you how it feels,
Baby it's time that you see me for real...

Sorry if I sound confused
I don't feel the way you do
But I won't turn around
But I won't turn around

Think that I might back down
But I won't
Think that I might have doubts
But I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be
Think that you know me now
But you don't
Think that I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be

Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go
Trust that I know
This is my show
Letting you know
Gotta go the way I go

Think that I might back down
But I won't

But I don't
No insecurities
Won't you just let me, let me be

But you don't
Think that  I can't stand on my own
Ain't my philosophy
Won't you just let me, let me be

But i don't
No insecurities
