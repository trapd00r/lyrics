Every word I said is what I mean
Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need

Virgin eyes and dirty looks
On what I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook

Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking

So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said what's in it for me

Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel

Buying lies and stealing jokes
And laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took

Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken

So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said what's in it for me
