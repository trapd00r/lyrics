You know what time it is nigga,
and you know who the fuck this is. DANGER!
DANGER! Get on the floor! The feelin right here what you want to see! Sing it!

Chorus:
Been so long (sing it!)
heat's been on
So please (get on the floor!)
Show me (the feelin right here!)
What it is that you want to see

(Mystikal:)
Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keepin' you niggas and bitches in jump from the minute I get on
Taking they shit off, showing they tattoos,
screamin, and hollerin' and all
Got the gift to come up with it,
put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, bitch I been on!
Sharp! Like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad! Like that student in the principal's office
Put rappers in coffins
They dive like dolphins
I'm that talented lyrical marvel you don't come across often, so
Watch yourself!
Don't  fuck around, get beside yourself
I know! Go ahead though
Bounce them titties, shake that ass, drop that pussy
Stay in line, hoe
A Fucka can't, cuz you can can
Cock up, head down, pussy poppin' on a handstand
I believe that pussy's smokin'
If you wanna do somethin'
Then bend over, and bust that pussy open

Chorus x 2

(Mystikal)
My fuckin' concert line around the corner
Parking cars, niggas lookin' for they bitch, nothing on her!
You lookin' good momma
Why? Pshh, what's up hoe?
Sirens, limousines, and the club owner
Ya bitch you!
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch
Cuz it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough!
I'm backstage bouncin'
Adrenalin building up!
That pussy color
Did I stutter?
The heart flutter
Make your woman drawers melt down like butter
Down like Nelly
Hype like "Belly"
The rhyme seller!
Kick ass like Jim Kelly!
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it
Then bitch come on down!
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit
Then BITCH THAT'S WHAT IT IS!

Chorus x 2

DANGER!
Talkin 'bout
DANGER!
Motherfucker look!
Get on the floor!
The feelin right here!
DANGER!

DANGER!
(Look look) look at what? (look look)
Get on the floor!
The feelin right here!
Get 'em up!!!

Chorus x 2
