Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
Sweet, sweet smile, and it's fading fast
'Cause everybody's gone at last

Don't get upset about it. No I'm not anymore
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before

Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last

I hope you're not waiting, waitin' 'round for me
'Cause I'm not going anywhere, obviously

Got a broken heart and a name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last
