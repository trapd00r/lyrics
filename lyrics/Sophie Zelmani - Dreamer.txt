Seasons, my friend. 
Color me so we can blend.
Forbid me to go, 
I know so little about the wind when it blows.

Dreamer, dreamer. 
I'm walking out of your dream.

Take me off that parade, 
and place me somewhere
in your sense of a shades.
Your night shuts my door, 
and I will not dream anymore.

See if I can pass by that waiting hand,
if I can pass by that wandering man.
If I can leave to get on,
see that it all makes sense pretty soon.

Dreamer, dreamer. 
I'm walking out, while you go on.
Dreamer, dreamer,
I'll be where I belong.
Dreamer, dreamer.

Dreamer, dreamer. 
I'm walking out, while you go on.
Dreamer, dreamer,
But dreamers don't come along
Dreamer, dreamer
I'll be where I belong.
Dreamer, dreamer,
Stop me if I'm wrong.

Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
