(feat. Monica)

[Intro: DMX] + (Monica)
GRRRRRRRRRRR.. yeah
I mean we all men, we all men
We know how the shit go.. love one, fuck another
I mean, it is what it is, it is what it is
I mean, we knew what it was, when we became a part of it (yeahh)
Ain't no sense whinin about it now, feel me?
It's like..

[Monica] + (DMX)
There's something on your mind (WHAT!)
I can see right through you
I know your girl been treatin you wrong (YEA!)
But she ain't no good for you
Why do you hold it inside (UHH!)
Boy you should let me know
I just want to make you right
Wanna be the one you could cry on

[DMX]
Baby, it's like I love my wife
But we goin through things and I ain't goin home tonight
You got time for a nigga, or is he still with you?
Wanna meet at the same spot, or should I come and get you?
Aight, I'll be there in 10, be in the front
I been gettin what I need so I'ma give you what you want
One-on-one, cause you know how to talk to Dog
You walk the dog and understand New York is hard, baby

[Chorus: Monica and DMX]
[M] So you, you ain't gotta go home tonight
[M] You can stay right here with me
[D] Uhh.. I ain't goin nowhere
[D] When you wake up I'm gon' be right there
[M] Don't you worry 'bout a thing
[D] I ain't worried about SHIT!
[M] You're here with me
[D] Look, it's like I love my wife
[D] But we goin through things and I ain't goin home tonight, AIGHT?

[Monica] + (DMX)
It's kinda strange, that when you call (mmm)
She's never home
Now you're there all alone
And, you deserve so much more baby (WHAT!)
I can treat you better than she can (WHAT!)
It doesn't make sense
To keep on loving, and keep on trusting
When, in return all you get is nothing

[DMX]
Damn, you got me fucked up and I'm feelin it more
Never had a mis-tress dis-tressed before
Oh come on ma, like it ain't that deep
Like ain't no love there, like I don't hate that I gotta creep
We go to sleep in each others arms (YEA!)
And I feel like this is where I belong
If lovin you is right then I ain't wrong
This is the same ol' song, wife and fam
Gotta be a father and husband but I'm still yo' man, baby

[Chorus]

[Monica] + (DMX)
This situation's getting critical (uh-huh!)
I watch so many tears fall (uh-huh!)
I know she's not what you want (uh-huh!)
So why you keep on holding on? (GRRRRR)
When I'm right here (WHAT!)
All you need to do is call (WHAT!)
Don't be afraid (YEA!)
Cause she won't know at, ALLLLLLLLL

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs
