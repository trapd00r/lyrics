I could wait in summer, wait in winter
Wait in spring or even fall
It may be so... i know

Cream:
U don't know u...u...u..oughta know
U should know..u shouldn't wait no more
More o these chains on da door
Chains on da door, get up on it, WAKE UP!!!! buckle up ya catchin a cold
Catchin a cold if u wait until da summer an fall
An when da winter comes then shes all gone!
Wheres she? All gone
Wheres she? All gone..all gone. Wheres she?
All gone.. all gone..Where?
(U be saying) ;
Whos da cat? Who who who could be dat?
Whos da brat? Who took her took her T-cat
Who be dat who took an finger licked her?
Who be dat? Who took her up in da sack?
Only cream can make a girl glad
An in a cake dats what they all grab
So pigeon if u want it real bad.
Just wait.

Chorus:
I could wait in summer, wait in winter
Wait in spring, or even fall
It may be so... I know
If i wait in summer, wait in winter
Wait in spring, or even fall
You might say no, i know

Pigeon:
I was walkin around, then I saw her,
Whats ma name?
ITS pigeon.
Tired of U wastin ma time...tired of watchin days go by
While ya funnin an runnin an maybe out big timin
a big flirt A BIG FLIRT!
So what U gonna do when I come for U?
Got a plan or U gonna pass like a flue?
Whats ya plan? I got a good feeling about U
Tell me now.. I don't need to be a bugaboo
What should i do now?

Cream:
Now from da first time dat we met,
I told U im free on next summer next

Yeah U got game an ya whole thangs set,
Butï¿½.only cream can make a girl glad
An in a cake dats what they all grab
So pigeon if U want it real bad
Just wait

Chorus

Cream:
If u know it's me for sure
And your mind is good to go
If you dreamt of this before
then you could be just summore
if you dunno hot from cold
and you're set to hit the road
if you want to hurt the show
then u should not wait no more

Chorus
