I can feel the sunlight
I love the morning sunlight
I can feel the sunlight
After the party tonight
You turn gray skies into...

The summer is here
It's the anthem for y'all
I'm riding my car
With the top down and the wind blow

Turn this up and let's celebrate
We can't wait until the springbreak

Everybody's swimming
Backyard full of women
Come on let sunlight in your heart

I can feel the sunlight
I love the morning sunlight
I can feel the sunlight
After the party tonight
You turn gray skies into...

The summer is here
It's the anthem for y'all
I'm riding my car
With the top down and the wind blows

Turn this up and let's celebrate
We can't wait until the springbreak

Everybody's swimming
Backyard full of women
Come on let sunlight in your heart
