And the daylight is leaving
The work is nearly done
In the quiet of the evening
There is a song

Goodnight all you cowboys
Well you're plainspun and rough
But the angels appeared one time
To folks such as us

And goodnight to all you cowgirls
Until we next meet
You will sweeten our memories
And dreams while we sleep

And goodnight wide Wyoming
If that's still where we are
But if we've wandered into heaven
Well Jackson Hole's not that far

Oh night the daylight stealing
All you gold from the sky
You're a poor thief you're leaving
All your diamonds behind
You're a poor thief you're leaving
All your diamonds behind

Goodnight all you cowboys
We've got treasures enough
'Cause the angels appeared one time
To those such as us

Goodnight all you cowboys
Oh you're plainspun and rough
'Cause the angels appeared one time
To folks such as us
Such as us
