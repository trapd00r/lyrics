Hanoi Hannah averaged 'bout a man a day
And when she wasn't workin'
She kept the coffee perkin'
For the guy who didn't have to pay
On Hanoi Hanna workin' all my blues away

My home is in Kentucky but lovin' makes me want to stay
The captain says I'm lucky
But the chaplan says I ought to pray
And Hanoi Hanna workin' all my blues away

Well I never would have thought
I'd get so lost out here
Smokin' marijuana and drinkin' beer
And tryin' not to think about the time next year
When me and all my buddies gonna disappear
Hanoi Hanna workin' all my blues away

Hanoi Hannah took her shoes and ran away
When I hold her I was headin'
To have myself a weddin'
To my baby in the U.S.A.
Good-bye Hannah I really don't know what to say

Well good-bye Hannah
Well good-bye Hannah
Well good-bye Hannah
