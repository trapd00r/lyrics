But fuck with the big dogs yo, I gotta bite ya
Look, it's outta my hands
And you gettin money 'round here

You leave me no choice

Now calm your boys
Cause I'm findin' it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point?

And a promise you neva, no matter the weather,
Eva eva eva eva eva eva eva come around here no mo'
