Just like the experiment with a rat
Ya' could choose food or he could choose crap
The rat he starved to death
But I didn't die, at least not yet
I'm still just about capable of one last defiant ?

There's somethin' in my brain
There's somethin' in my brain
There's somethin' in my brain
Got somethin' in my brain, dig it

That rat he was luckier than his brothers and sisters
Sittin' in their cages all covered in blisters
A man with scary eyes and syringe tattoo said "Ya know
What we do to rats, we're gonna do it to you"
He burned out their eyes, cut their stomachs open
Now the future of ratkind just seems dystopian

Just then a train of thought, stopped at a station
I got off
We've both been there and back again

There's somethin' in my brain
There's somethin' in my brain
There's somethin' in my brain
Been there and back again

So rock's got into me, oh yeah
Rock's got into me, oh yeah
Rock's got into me, oh yeah
Now rock n' roll is back in me, oh yeah

Just like the experiment with a rat
He could choose life or he could choose crap

There's somethin' in my brain
There's somethin' in my brain
There's somethin' in my brain
Got somethin' in my brain

This is an allegorical tale
This is an allegorical tale
It's an allegorical tale
Don't take prisoners, don't get ?
