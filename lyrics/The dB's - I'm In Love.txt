I love what I don't understand
I don't understand this attraction
Surprise, surprise
What's been going on?

I've got, I've got no idea
Just how far to press my luck
Surprise, surprise
Now I'm thinking.

Any way it turns out
It could turn out any way
It could be this, it could be that
It could be none of the above.

Guess I don't understand why
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love.

I thought the thought was enough
I thought I knew it all
It's over my head
But I'm still thinking.

Any way it works out
You know it could work out any way
It could be bad, it could be good
It could be none of the above.

Guess I don't understand why
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love.

Running away from myself
I fell into someone else
Who didn't know exactly what to think.

I love what I don't understand
But I don't understand what's been going on
Surprise, surprise
Looks like I'm in love.

Any way it works out
It could work out any way
It could be this, it could be that
It could be none of the above.

Guess I don't understand
No, I don't understand
Yes, I don't understand why
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love.
