Mr Lonely (Hex Hector Mix)

Each night you held me in your arms
Still you never did keep me warm
Conversation was a waste of time
You never even asked what was on my mind (oh I)
It's funny how I can't recall your touch
Spending time alone with you is never enough
This emptiness I feel is too much
You may not understand there's been a change of plans

Mr. Lonely, you gotta go
You need to pack your bags and be out the door
Even though you were there for me
You never cared for me
Before I couldn't see now I know
Mr. Lonely, I'm in love
I've found a real man and you need to know
And this time you won't be coming back
'Cause his love will last
Mr. Lonely, who's lonely now?

Two o'clock on a Sunday afternoon
Same place, same park, but where were you?
I waited, but you never came
That's when he sat down, but it wasn't the same (oh I)
Every word I said, he'd listen to
Everything he had, I was missing in you
He's the man I've never had before
I won't be needing you no more

The silence was killing me
It almost got the best of me
And now that I've got room to breathe
I'm making some changes, changes
I'm stronger now, I'm wiser now
A real man wants to hold me now
It's clear to see I'll never be Mrs. Lonely

If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight (my) babe
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight (my) babe
