Strange to be on Marvel Hill
I've walked some years to find
I know there is a piece to fill
the gap I have in mind
No, nothing's here, I close my eyes
it's on the other side
And what I've worked so hard to gain
I'd gladly give away
'cause I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more
a postcard from where life is athrill
on top of Marvel Hill
but I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more
no, I don' t need this
too good to be true
too good to ignore
I don't need this
I need so much more
It's too much to ask for
