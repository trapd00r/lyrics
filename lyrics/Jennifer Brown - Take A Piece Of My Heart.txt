Speaking from experience
I know what youâve been through
I know youâre hurt
I have been hurt too
Love dies hard
And life goes on
Only time will tell

When to hold on
When to let go
When to forget
And Iâll let it show
When you reach out
I will be there
Love finds a way
When somebody cares
Enough to hold on

Weâve found a flame
That moves the heart
And brings you here tonight
Looking at you
I know memories never die
Love tries so hard
And life goes on
And only time will tell

When to hold on
When to let go
When to forget
And Iâll let it show
When you reach out
I will be there
Love finds a way
When somebody cares
Enough to hold on

Look at the pieces of our lives
We try to make some sense
Here you are back into my life
Both of us wondering again

When to hold on
When to let go
When to forget
And Iâll let it show
When you reach out
I will be there
Love finds a way
When somebody cares
Enough to hold on
