Pax Americana
Fox Australiana
Smoked a banana and visualised a liquid metal Virginia Woolf
Liposuction Tuesday
Steak night Wednesday
Breast augmentation paid for caviar on Christmas Day
And if I work an afternoon, by May we'll both be on the moon
Touching glasses with Richard Branson and his harpy queens
I'm too apathetic to defend my heterosexuality
But I'll not lie here on my phone while being fucked by the Man

Angel, angel, you talked to me
And I don't even care if you were lying about being clean
Angel, you're still an angel despite the speed
Only seventeen, with blackened teeth

Angel, you talked to me
I don't even care if you were lying about being clean
Angel, you're still an angel despite the speed
Only seventeen, with blackened teeth
