There's clothes all over the floor
Don't remember them being here before
Smell of perfume isn't here
Why's lipstick on the mirror
Still I don't understand

No pictures left in the hall
There is three new holes in my wall
Where the hell's my credit cards
Why's my wallet in the yard
Still I don't understand

Well I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why's love gotta be so tough

Should seen the look on my face
My shits all over the place
Why's this happening to me
Why'd you take both sets of keys
And still I don't understand

Well now I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why's love gotta be so tough

And now I guessed I should've listened

There's clothes all over my floor
Don't remember them being here before
There are no candles in here
Lipstick still on my mirror
Still I don't understand

Now I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why must life be so tough

Well I guess I should've listened
When you said you had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father
In one ear and out the other 
Why life gotta be so tough
