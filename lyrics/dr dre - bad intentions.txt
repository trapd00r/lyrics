Supa ugly

Put ya cups up
Get ya smoke in
Baby we partyin
Ain't nobody loccin
Who you provokin
What you want now
Take a look around
There's pimp shit goin' down
There's alota bitches
A whole lotta freaks
Top notch hoes
They flockin every week
What you wanna do
Get ya next thrill
Take a x pill
How the sex feel
Damn you lookin' good
All 10 of y'all
Wanna roll
Pump dick in y'all
Keep ya face down
Keep ya ass up
You know what you doin'
Keep that shit movin
Keep them titties jumpin'
Keep the henny comin'
Every bitch in here need to be touchin somethin'
I know they like it hot
That's why I keep it hot
So why the fuck could they not want a piece of doc?

I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm just drinkin', smokin', straight west coastin
Bitches puttin' ass in motion, pussy poppin', sex, promotin
Is that a cup? raise it up
Is that a blunt? blaze it up
Is that your bitch? on these nuts
Dre I don't give a fuck
All I really know is ya hoe wants to be with me
And she ain't playing and what I'm sayin'
She creeps with me and sleeps between the sheets

Soon as the door close
I make 'em curl toes
They all wanna get chose
We never love y'all
My niggas all macs
We sip alotta yac (cognac)
Fuck and never call back
Pack women in the club till it's pitch black
Thugs on the block wondering where their bitch at
Where you think nigga
She with the aftermath
Call the house she ain't home she with aftermath
No talking
Fuck how ya day goes
You want dick
Well bitch say so
Don't be shy now
Probably the best at it
They say a party ain't a party till the west had it
Gravitate to the doc like it's automatic
Take your clothes off
Make me wanna grab it
Turn around with it
Make me wanna stab it
Time to get it crackin'
Show me them bad habits

I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm just drinkin', smokin', straight west coastin
Bitches puttin' ass in motion, pussy poppin', sex, promotin
Is that a cup? raise it up
Is that a blunt? blaze it up
Is that your bitch? on these nuts
Dre I don't give a fuck
All I really know is ya hoe wants to be with me
And she ain't playing and what I'm sayin'
She creeps with me and sleeps between the sheets

When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me
And what I'm sayin' is she ain't playin'
She creeps with me and sleeps between the sheets
