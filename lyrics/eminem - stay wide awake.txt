Yo, follow me, come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world, so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
(Stay wide awake) 

Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark it's winter in December
I see my target put my car in park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend ta befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl you mighta'
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda' girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya

I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian yeah now let's see her have triplets then I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-
-hyde and cyanide girl, you can try and hide you can try to scream louder

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin', I'd rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull pull another one out uh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
(Stay wide awake) 

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide and seek like Jason, I'm so hungry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me
Pull the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound 'sleep

Who's wakin' me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin' me she tries to scream somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me he's bitin' me he's laughing like it's funny
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escaping me no dice you see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but its alright with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

Better try ta stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how 'bout now are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
Must have just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there

Prowler there's no one fouler, bound ya that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess look how ya cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt, beddy bye-bye beddy bye-bye it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matta'
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water

Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun ta act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1 someone's comin' in from the back

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
(Stay wide awake)
