Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new, I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

"I said it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote

It's stupid how I'm going knowing everybody knowing that
I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat, than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing it was this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind

Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago,
Ain't nothing new, I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote

Eminem
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah, you're late, your train left.
Mascara and egg smear on your face
Night's over, goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's coming up after I blindfold her,
She still comes back to my crib,
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But I won't buy her a soda
Unless it's rock 'n' ride cola.
Buy you a bag of fritos, I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Try'na pull 5 bucks from me is like try'na pull 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch, you're already bi-polar...

Eminem
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

T.I.
The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Peso, Euro, Yen, ah ha, I'm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is BANG!
It's so nice where I kick it,
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro, this road, we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

Eminem
Yeah I guess life is a bitcha, ain't it, TIP?
And this one can say this shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt of my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time in it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant, well, I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the "F" on dawg

T.I.
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came
They were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty, that's why

Eminem
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
T.I.
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
Eminem
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
T.I.
But still I ball like there's no tomorrow
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
"I said it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
