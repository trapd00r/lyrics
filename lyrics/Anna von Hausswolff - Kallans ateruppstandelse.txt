In the golden sun
The disarming sun
When my body bleeds
While we become undone
When the morning comes to embrace
The glorious I shall become
To see your face and to see your smile
And all the traces that I have left behind

And the seasons change
To mark my home
The glorious I shall become
To dissolve myself into emptiness
And to rise again with one stone less
