The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you

I want you
I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you

The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to open up the gate for you

I want you
I want you
Yes, I want you so bad
Honey, I want you

I want you
I want you
Yes, I want you so bad
Honey, I want you

Want you
I want you
Yes, I want you so bad
Honey, I want you
