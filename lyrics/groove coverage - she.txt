She hangs out every day near by the beach 
Having a Heineken falling asleep 
She looks so sexy when she's walking to sand 
Nobody ever put a ring on her hand 

Swim to the oceanshore fishing the sea 
She is the story, the story is she 
She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky 
Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why 

She is the one that you'll never forget 
She is the heaven sent angel you met 
Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl 
She is so pretty all over the world 

She puts the rythm, the beat in the drum 
She comes in the morning, in the evening she's gone 
Every little hour, every second you live 
Trust in eternity, that's what she gives 

She looks like Marilyn, walks like Susanne 
She talks like Monica and Mary-Ann 
She wins in everything that she might do 
And she will respect you, forever just you 

She is the one that you'll never forget 
She is the heaven sent angel you met 
Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl 
She is so pretty all over the world 

She is so pretty all over the world 
She is so pretty 
She is like you and me, like them, like we 
She's in you and me 

She is the one that you'll never forget 
She is the heaven sent angel you met 
Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl 
She is so pretty all over the world
