How do I get you out of my head?
How do I get you back in my bed?
Oh love oh love

Tell me you're crazy, tell me you're scared
Tell me you still love what you had
Oh love oh love

When there's no more sins to care about
And I'll end up where I'm now
When it's all been said and done
No one can save me

Make me no witness
Hear me now
Oh oh make me no witness

No one can save me
Love me or hate me
I'll keep on waiting
Nothing I want to

Treat my love like a straight good job
Oh love oh love

When there's no more sins to care about
And I'll end up where I'm now
When it's all been said and done
No one can save me

Oh Make me no witness
Hear me now
Oh oh Make me no witness

Tell me how many times (?)
Oh oh Make me no witness

No one can save me
Love me or hate me
No one can save me
Love me or hate me
No one can save me
Love me or hate me

When there's no more sins to care about
And I'll end up where I'm now
When it's all been said and done
No one can save me

Oh Make me no witness
Hear me now
Oh oh Make me no witness
Hear me now
Oh Make me no witness
Hear me now
Oh oh Make me no witness
