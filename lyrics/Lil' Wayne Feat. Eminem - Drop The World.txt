Lil Wayne
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love on my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain

I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times, seems further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb

The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga, it be on mo'fucker
'Cause all this bullshit, done made me strong mo'fucker

So I pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
Bitch I'ma pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
And I can die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker, I'm gone (Motherfucker I'm gone)

I know what, they don't wanna tell you
Just hope your heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I woke up in the world, and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain, they can't wipe off (Uh)

My word is my pride, but wisdom is bleak
And that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murder and bribe
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Ha-ha, Yeah)
Bitch I'ma pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
And I can die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker, I'm gone (Motherfucker I'm gone, I'm gone)

Eminem
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you can see, just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all

Man it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Uhp, it's time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin' boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes, I stole that fuckin' clock I took the time and I

Came up from behind, and pretty much snuck up and butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another, I'ma make these fucking haters believe it

I swear to God won't spare the rod, I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch, and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie, permanently bitch it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die

My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk you're trapped in my medicine ball
I can run circles around you so fast, your fuckin' head'll spin dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'

Lil Wayne
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
Bitch I'm pick the world up, and I'm drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
And I can die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship, and leave earth motherfucker, I'm gone (Motherfucker I'm gone, I'm gone)
