Lets turn this house into a happy home
This is for all the homeboys that couldn't get their happy home
Lets turn this house into a happy home

As long one of us got it some of us got it
Lets turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for me boo
Hold on

(Verse 1)
Now we been kicking it for quite some time
Remain beside me through these trials and this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight
Sippin alize and crystal while in every night
In my bedroom, promise that I'll commit to you sometime
Kiss me every time you see me step inside a room
Promise to be good to each other
Plus I love ya so I know your gonna make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm trying
You can stay with my mama but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or hoe
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house
And got a happy home

(Chorus)
Happy Home
Lets turn the house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home

Heh

(Verse 2)
Going through these hard times
Ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your fathers crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowing you'll get scarred though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's mama made her my wife now
I'm trying hard y'all
Maybe in time, I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of together and forever we rise
If it would help our child grow then together we die
Why, question my love? It's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life
Inside this happy home

(Chorus)
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home

Happy Home

(Tupac talking)
All these problems got me gone
We got a family of our own
I just want a happy home
Turn this house into a happy home
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home

Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home

Hey
Turn this house into a happy home
As long one of us got it some of us got it
Turn this house into a happy home
