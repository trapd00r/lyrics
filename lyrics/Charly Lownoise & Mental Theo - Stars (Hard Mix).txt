So if you see the stars tonight
Then tell me what they say
And let me know how bright they are
And I will always pray

And I will always pray

Your great style
Come on!

So if you see the stars tonight
Then tell me what they say
And let me know how bright they are
And I will always pray

That one day you'll come down to me
To tell me from above
My angel from the universe
The one I always love

Your great style
Come on!
