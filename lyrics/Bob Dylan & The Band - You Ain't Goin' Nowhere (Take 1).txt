Clouds so swift, and rain fallin' in
Gonna see a movie called 'Gunga Din'
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn
You ain't a'goin' nowhere

Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
That my bride's a'gonna come
Whoo-ee!, Are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

Genghis Khan and his brother, Don
Could not keep on keepin' on
We'll climb that bridge after it's gone
After we're way past it

Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
That my bride's a'gonna come
Whoo-ee!, Are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair. Yeah.

Buy me some rings and a gun that sings
A flute that toots and a bee that stings
A sky that cries and a bird that flies
A fish that walks and a dog that talks

Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
That my bride's a'gonna come
Whoo-ee!, Are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
That my bride's a'gonna come
Whoo-ee!, Are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair
