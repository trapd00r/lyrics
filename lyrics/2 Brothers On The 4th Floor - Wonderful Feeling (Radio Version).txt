Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
I'm so high, I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do to keep the sky so blue?
There must be someone who will buy

Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
I'm so high, I swear I could fly
Me oh my, I don't want to lose it
So what am I to do to keep the sky so blue?
There must be someone who will buy

Who will buy this wonderful morning?
Such a sky you never did see
Who will tie it up with a ribbon
And put it in a box for me?

Who will buy my sweet red roses
Two blooms for a penny?
Who will buy my sweet red roses
Two blooms for a pence?

Who will buy my sweet red roses
Two blooms for a penny?
Who will buy my sweet red roses
Two blooms for a pence?

(Who will buy the smell of flowers
Waving in the moonlit breeze?
Who will buy the childrens' laughter
Happily playing in the streets)

(Who will buy the heat of sun that's
Shining in the deep blue sea?
Who will buy this wonderful feeling?
No-one, 'cause it's all for free)
