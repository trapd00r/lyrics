Emma:
She used to be my only enemy and never let me free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day, I crossed the line
I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

Melanie C and Victoria and Geri:
Back then, I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

All:
Mama, I love you, Mama, I care
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
Melanie C:
You're my friend

Melanie B:
I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I had a lot of time to think about
About the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Melanie C & Victoria and Geri:
Back then, I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Melanie C:
You're my friend

But now, I'm sure I know why (Melanie B: I know why)
Why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes (Melanie B: see through your eyes)
All I can give you is love (Melanie B: all I can give you is love)
