This is my island in the sun
Where my people have
Toiled since time begun
Though I may sail on many a sea
Her shores will always be home to me

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of her forest, waters
Her shining sand

As morning breaks
The heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of her forest, waters
Her shining sand

There is woman on bended knee
Cutting cane for her family
A man stands at the waterside
Casting nets at the surging tide

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of her forest, waters
Her shining sand
