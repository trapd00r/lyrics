Pilgrim across the water
We are the same brother
Hitchhiking back to Zion
Hold in our tears as we flip the album
What if this leads to ruin?
You got a soul, use it
All this despair forgiven
Rolling away on a Wheel of Sevens
She sings like the Queen of Sheba
Voice through a blown speaker
One drop and bubbling Leslie
Calling me home like Haile Selassie

Pilgrim beside the fire
It's been a long winter
We got a lot in common
Cover our heads as they split the atom
All of our days are numbered
I've taken some comfort
In knowing the wave has crested
Knowing I don't have to be an exception
Children they fill the bleachers
One is the next Caesar
Keep all their minds collected
Until he comes, until he comes

Hide the Omega Day in plain sight
Too good to be true

I've seen stranger things
I've seen that tree of smoke
I've seen stranger things happen before

Pilgrim up on the mountain
Barefoot and still climbing
Filling the Book of Hours
Day after day in the filth and squalor
We are the chosen people
Safe from the next evil
One Love, magnetic memory
Reel after reel spinning within me

I had the wildest dream last night
I was swimming with you
In that cenote the heavens made with black fire
Just woke up too soon

I've seen stranger things
I've seen those daytime ghosts
I've seen stranger things happen before

I've seen stranger things
I've seen that tree of smoke
I've seen stranger things happen before
