The sun is sleeping quietly, once upon a century
Wistful oceans calm and red, ardent caresses laid to rest
For my dreams I hold my life, for wishes I behold my nights
The truth at the end of time, losing faith makes a crime

I wish for this nightime to last for a lifetime
The darkness around me, shores of a solar sea
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun
Sleeping, weeping, with you

Sorrow has a human heart, from my God it will depart
I'd sail before a thousand moons, never finding where to go
Two hundred twenty-two days of light will be desired by a night
A moment for the poet's play until there's nothing left to say

I wish for this nightime to last for a lifetime
The darkness around me, shores of a solar sea
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun
Sleeping, weeping, with you

I wish for this nightime to last for a lifetime
The darkness around me, shores of a solar sea
Oh how I wish to go down with the sun
Sleeping, weeping, with you
