Ah, Suge what I tell you nigga,
When I come out of jail what was I gonna do
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas chest, right
Watch this, hey Quik let me see them binoculars, nigga
The binoculars

Ha ha ha ha, yeah nigga time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side
The real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real mutha-fuckas
And there's gonna be some pussys
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussys are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends
But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1 it's a emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men


The Heartz of Men

My lyrical verse with so much pain
That to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
It gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And five-o, get your lights on, fight long
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this till the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
If ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men


In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
My pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
Like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up
But still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward 'cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
'Cause I've been sent
The heartz of men
