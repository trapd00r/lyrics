Shes a formal princess 
From the moment she wakes up to rinse her face 
All the way to when she lays to sleep, in space 
She creeps through life 
Energy she uses exclusively 
To keep all of these people in their place 
If only she would understand her 
If she understood, how good, or am
Or maybe, find the root of the problem 
With a plan, is it plausible 
Cant be the princess, carries the pride 
Of a deity, sexy little goddess 
Fashionably modest, obviously falsified, honestly doubtless 
Lotus, of course ive noticed the imaginary roses 
Made it impossible not to focus 
Hopeless, ill never get my point across that bay 
Hopeless, tried and denied at least once a day 
I dont need your advice 
What i need is some shade to keep the sunlight out of my eyes
