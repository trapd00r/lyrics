I guess I'm a bad girl
I learned to make you cry
I'm hanging my guilty conscience
Drying on the line

Love's hangover is drifting away
I'm good and ready for love
'Cause I know it's a Saturday

Heaven should help me
You are my weekend lover
Just my plaything
When it's raining
I'm just like the weather
Never the same
I can’t help it
I was made that way

I guess you’re a bad boy
Fooled around for years
I'm making my mind up, Baby
A change is good my dear

Love's hangover is drifting away
I'm good and ready for love
'Cause I know it's a Saturday
Heaven should help me
You are my weekend lover
Just my plaything
When it's raining
I'm just like the weather
Never the same
I can't help it
I was made that way

Heaven should help you
You better run for cover
I'm sunshine and thunder
It's a wonder

And when I say good bye
I want you to stay
I can't help it
I was made that way

Heaven should help me
You are my weekend lover
Just my plaything
When it's raining
I'm just like the weather
Never the same
I can't help it
I was made that way

Heaven should help you
You better run for cover
I'm sunshine and thunder
It's a wonder
And when I say goodbye
I want you to stay
I can't help it
I was made that way

I was made that way
And I'm here to stay, Baby

I was made that way
And I'm here to stay, Baby
