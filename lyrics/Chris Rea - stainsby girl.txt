Some girls used to kiss and run
Never knew what they had done
Some girls always wasted time
Keep you hanging on the line
Some loved horses and always stayed at home
But the stainsby girls loved the rolling stones

Now some had games that you had to play
Making rules along the way
Strange attractions newly found
Pride and passion kicked around




Some girls stole your heart
Like most girls do
But a stainsby girls could break it in two

And i fell in love, i fell in love
I fell in love with a stainsby girl

Deepest water stainsby blue
Names and faces fade away
Memories here to stay

And i fell in love, i fell in love
I fell in love with a stainsby girl
