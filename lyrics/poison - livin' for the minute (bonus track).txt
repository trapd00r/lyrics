Two-bit Billy was the coolest guy I ever saw
Didn't want no piece of the pie, he had to take it all
With his guitar slung low hangin' right about the knee
He made the biggest scene, he made the ladies scream,
He had a snakebite smile if you know what I mean

Chorus
He was livin' for the minute, livin' his life from day to day
If you want it, then take it
He said that's the rules if you wanna play

Magazine covers always shootin' poor Billy's face
He kept a score of his ladies chalked up on his guitar case
He was a bad-ass rockin', baby, always rollin' out the sounds
Like some freight train come and did a six-string strut and just tore the damn place to the ground

Chorus

Solo

Chorus 2x
Ow! Oww! Ow! Oww!! Owww!!
