Time goes by
And every single tear
It must have well run dry
And the lonely nights
Become a strange accepted way

And the years go past
Just like the old song says
The pain with time has healed
It could not last

But oh a friend
Like a fool mentions your name

Sunny days, drunken nights
You smile and say It's all right
But oh the cold, cold rain
At the mention of your name

Forgive me please
If I shrug my shoulders
When I put my friends at ease
As I get older
It's not that I don't feel colder than before
Oh I've become so good at hiding
What I feel without confiding
It's still the same
At the mention of your name
