Woo, say what 
Uh, from ‘79 to ‘95, old to the new style 
Track fat so we're going back 
Way back so nod your head, boy and Gayle 
Take it on, Michelle 

I think about ya in the pouring rain, yeah 
Splashing down on my window pane 
I think about ya in the bright sunshine, yeah 
I think about you all the time 
And I never want to let your love go, it's true 
Oh baby, yeah 
If you ask me I will never tell you no 
No matter what you say or do, mmm 

Happy just to be with you (happy, happy) 
Happy just to know you're mine 
And every day I say a prayer (say a prayer) 
That you'll stay with me all of the time, hey 
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo 
(I'm happy) I'm happy (so happy), so happy 
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo 
(I'm happy) I'm happy (with cha baby) with you (yeah) 

My mind goes to ya when I'm feeling down, mmm 
Your picture takes away my lonely frown 
My heart is with ya when I'm feeling good 
I'd spend every minute with you if I could 
Baby, know that what I say and how I feel is true 
So true, yeah 
My emotions could never be more real 
Than when I'm making love to you 

Happy just to be with you, yeah 
Happy just to know you're mine, yeah 
And every day I say a prayer, say a prayer 
That you'll stay with me all of the time 
Sing along with me for one time 
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo 
(I'm happy) I'm happy (so happy), so happy, yeah 
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo 
(I'm happy) I'm happy (with cha baby) with you (yeah) 

Uh, one hundred percent of graphic funk that stunk out your trunk 
Give me the bomb squad so I can blow up this song (say what) 
MTV, they call me this mad expedition 
AKA Man terrorizing your vision (woo) 
So listen, I'm hard like stone so hell with shining the cannon 
Me shoot it far low for Armageddon 
I'm nifty, I dance, part of 350 
I'm nimble, I think I'll change my name to a symbol (oh oh oh) 

Baby, know that what I say and how I feel is true 
Oh, so true, yeah yeah 
My emotions could never be more real 
Than when I'm making love to you (to you, to you) 
Happy just to be with you, yeah 
Happy just to know you're mine, yeah 
(And every day I say a prayer) say a prayer 
(That you'll stay with me all of the time) 
Sing along with me for one time 
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo 
(I'm happy) I'm happy (so happy), so happy, yeah 
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo 
(I'm happy) I'm happy (with cha baby) with you (yeah), hey
