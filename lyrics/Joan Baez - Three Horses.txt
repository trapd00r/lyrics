In the early dawn a stallion white 
Prances the hills in the morning light. 
His bridle is painted with thunder and gold, 
Orchids and dragons, pale knights of old. 
He is the horse of the ages past. 
And now the children run to see 
The stallion on the hill, 
Bringing bags of apples 
And of clover they have filled. 
And the white horse tells his stories 
Of the days now past and gone 
And the children stand a-wondering 
Believing every song. 
How brightly glows the past. 

When the sun is high comes a mare so red, 
Trampling the graves of the living and dead. 
Her mantle is heavy with mirrors and glass, 
All is reflected when the red mare does pass. 
She is the horse of the here and now. 
And now there is confusion 
Amongst the children on the hill. 
They cling to one another 
And no longer can be still. 
While the red mare's voice is trembling 
With a rare and mighty call, 
The children start remembering 
The bearers and the pall. 
And though their many-colored sweaters 
Are reflected in the glass, 
And though the sun shines down upon them, 
They are frightened in the grass. 
How stark is the here and now. 

When night does fall comes a stallion black, 
So proud and tall he never looks back. 
He wears him no emeralds, silver and gold, 
Not even a covering to keep him from cold. 
He is the horse of the years to come. 
And I will get me down 
Before this steed upon my knees 
And sing to him the sorrows 
Of a thousand centuries. 
And the children now will scatter 
As their mothers call them home, 
For the sadness of the evening horse 
No child has ever known. 
And I will hang about him 
A bell that's never rung 
And thank him for the many words 
Which from his throat have never sprung. 
And I'll thank God and all the angels 
That the stallion of the evening, 
The black horse of the future, 
Comes to earth but has no tongue.
