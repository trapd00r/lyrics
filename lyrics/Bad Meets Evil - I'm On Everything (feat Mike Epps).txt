(Intro: Mike Epps)
All these little young kids ain't got no direction
Shit, these lil kids is on everything

(Hook: Mike Epps)
Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Hennessy, vodka (I'm on everything)

(Verse 1: Royce)
I'm on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed
Henny-Henny, sober don't interest me, I'm on everything
Bout to sip the liquor like it's 'caine, that's how high I am
(I take painkillers to ease the pain, though I ain't in pain
No, we, ain't the same, we drunk, I'm on everything)
'Cept when I kick it, gout, me sobering up, ha, Alf
Cash rules everything, acid tab, hash, 'rooms
I done woke up with a fucking tiger in my bathroom
I am fucking high, high, high, high
Menace to society I feel sorry for your mother
Me and Vicious on 'shrooms, call us the Mario Brothers
Back down, we never back down, never laid out, can't put my back down

(Verse 2: Eminem)
Painkillers, I call 'em 'caine pillars
'Cause they'll hold me up when I take 'em
I need a cane and pillows, I'm on everything
Sick when I kick it, barf, me sobering up, fart
I crush ya brain like a pill crusher, let's crush a pill yeah
Fuck, I think I just crushed my last Tylenol 3 up
Grab the key up off the counter till the camp all left the crib
Man, who'da knew that 3 in the morning I'd still be up
Could barely see up over the steering wheel, crashed the whip
Tore a tree up on my way to the dealer's, tryna re-up
Call me Brett Favre, spell it F-A-V-R-E, yep
It's wrong, other words I just fucked my RV up
Bitch, it's on again yeah, break that Klonopin in half
While I smoke some chronic in the cab with Donovan McNabb
And I dye my hair back blonde again and laugh
I'm the real macaroni you cheesy bitch, I'm demonic with the Kraft
There's a devil in my noodle, you angel hair pasta
Flows dreaded like some fucking tangled hair rastafarian, Jamaican
Relax man, I'll send a fucking axe at you if you insist on a fucking accent
Bad and Evil is back with an epidural, check ya girl
Cause after we pop you up, we popping her up
So, baby, come put ya feet up in these stirrups
Your boyfriend better find another fucking hornets nest to stir up
We rap like we're on

(Verse 3: Royce)
I'm on syrup painkillers, cigarette, speed, Henny... classic!
It's Eminem and him again, my sentiments exactly
I told that bitch to get at me, then the bitch attacked me
Kid you not, I'm lit up as fuck, tablecloth tucked in my pants then
I'm hearing dishes drop 'cause I walked away from my dinner with schmucks

(Eminem)
Then I aimed to the front of the K-Mart shopping center with a coupon book
And a hundred and ten bucks and a bunch of change
And wife beater with a mustard stain
I'll crush your brain like I'm crushing pills
What the fuck's the mothafuckin' deal?
This shit's making me feel like
I'm tryna do a mothafuckin' cartwheel up a hill

(Royce)
How many bars, how many tabs? A-C-I-D? Y-E-S
'Cause I'm sniffin NYES (F-U-C-Ked up, and it's obvious)
Smoking Henny in my chest (I'm B-A-N-A-N-A-S)
I'm a C-O-C-O-N-U-T

(Eminem)
Put this CD in and you'll see, the sequel to Scary Movie
Bad is too evil, the roofie to Roethlisberger
(You are gonna wind up six feet deep under
That shit's creek so I hope that you want preservers)
You could put a turd on the plate
Silverware on the tablecloth to serve us
You don't bring shit to the table
I mean your grill like a Seville when a mark gets murdered
You pushing the envelope and I'm shovin' that whole post office further
Right off the surface, to the serpents in the darkest and the farthest corner

(Royce)
How many bars? How many bars? Maui, wowee, sour diesel
How many jars to all my people I'll be the Mars, mommy come on
She can actually wrap my nutsack
'Round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall
And she can just puke from sipping this piss from my 24-inch catheter cord

(Eminem)
I'm the type that'll take a bath with a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
When I'm stashin' her in the back, smacking
Her forehead on the dash and its accidentally blowin', a Benz jeep horn

(Royce)
My friends be knowin', that when I'm on a binge, I'm stingy
Even when I'm ten deep in a room with the MGM with Lindsay Lohan and she on
