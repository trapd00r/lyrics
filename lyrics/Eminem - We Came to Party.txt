[Intro]
Young Zee, Digga, Em
Fill up ya...Ya

[Young Zee]
Usually its beef the more the merry
Me and Em fill up a thousand mortuaries
Till then no more in the cemetaries
And all ya fake mens is dead and buried

[Chorus- Eminem]
We just came to party
We aint comin here to start shit wit no body
Girl we just wanna see you work that work that body
With your man lookin like he could murk somebody
We just sipped a lil bit to much bicardi
He done tripped and tilt his cup and spilt it on me
Now he's startin some shit thats wit an army
He's about to get the shit kicked and ??? outta him

[Rah Digga]
So don't get testy mami tell ya peoples I got all the sets behind me
We surrounded by those cats that share they chronic
Why you wanna go left and test the grimey
Double barrel of your homies chest all slimey
Twirl ya hair, turn a starter to a bonet
Beatin bitches wit a bat and all that nonsense
Uppercuts go connect wit perfect timing

[Verse 1- Rah Digga]
Ya smack a camera out my face up on ETV
Try to front like I don't fuck with that MP3
Trustfunds overflow, got pearls and a boat
Watch ??? fall off like they Earl Managoat
Can tweeze 'em like a day at a moat
They say they real hip hop, I think they playin a joke
See when it come in the streets, I'ma spill them heaters
Ain't tryna end up like Amil and Vida

[Chorus- Eminem]
We just came to party
We aint comin here to start shit wit no body
Girl we just wanna see you work that work that body
With your man lookin like he could murk somebody
We just sipped a lil bit to much bicardi
He done tripped and tipped his cup and spilt it on me
Now he's startin some shit thats wit an army
He's about to get the shit kicked and ??? outta him

[Verse 2- Young Zee]
Ya Zee come get the riches, thats how I come way be filled wit sixes
Only bonin one chick cuz hoes be lyin
Fuck around and end up like Kobe Bryant
I just came to drink a thousand drops of henny
Fuck around and make me pop this semi
Man I live two lives, I roll wit stars to open bars
In the hood we still ride around in stolen stolen cars
Pop shit I'll put this gun in ya earing
Till I hear that loud tone and voice disappearing
Crow man I get high off the water
Wake up in the bed wit Ozzie Ozbournes daughter
Test us better give a vest to your wife
Or when I said it you'll regret it for the rest of your life
Ya we roll up on a gang of harleys
Zee, Digga, Em we just came to party

[Chorus- Eminem]
We just came to party
We aint comin here to start shit wit no body
Girl we just wanna see you work that work that body
With your man lookin like he could murk somebody
We just sipped a lil bit to much bicardi
He done tripped and tipped his cup and spilt it on me
Now he's startin some shit thats wit an army
He's about to get the shit kicked and ??? outta him
