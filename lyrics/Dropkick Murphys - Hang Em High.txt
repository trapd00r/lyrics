We waited together for the cowards to come
Outgunned and outnumbered but we wouldn’t run
No mercy, no quarter
They’ll pay for their sins
Now lower the cannons the battle begins

We waited together for the cowards to come
Outgunned and outnumbered but we wouldn’t run
No mercy, no quarter
They’ll pay for their sins
Now lower the cannons the battle begins

We weighed anchor in anger, set sail for revenge
Hoisted the canvas turned her into the wind
We’ll hang ‘em high for justice and the whole world will see
Now off with their heads boys and bring ‘em to me

We waited together for the cowards to come
Outgunned and outnumbered but we wouldn’t run
No mercy, no quarter
They’ll pay for their sins
Now lower the cannons the battle begins

We’ll rattle the sabers for the tyrants’ demise
Feed half to sharks and the rest to the flies
An honorable death for you would be too nice
I’d like to savor the moment and kill you twice

We waited together for the cowards to come
Outgunned and outnumbered but we wouldn’t run
No mercy, no quarter
They’ll pay for their sins
Now lower the cannons the battle begins

The battle begins
