I'm driving home from your house
Fireworks underneath my skin
Left a kiss on the mirror
And a cup in the sink
I knocked on wood in the afternoon
And you let me in
And now I'm driving home from your house
Something big's about to begin

No sleep, no sleep for the dreamer
Can't break the fever
No cure for the feeling
No sleep, no sleep for the dreamer
Wide-eyed believer
Counting stars on the ceiling
No sleep, no sleep
Replay, repeat
Sweetest fatigue
No sleep

I'm driving home from your house
Backseat of the cab you called
And the driver's telling stories
But I can't pay attention at all
And it's those laterly hours of morning radio
And people leaving bars
And there's something in the wind
There's something big about to start

No sleep, no sleep for the dreamer
Can't break the fever
No cure for the feeling
No sleep, no sleep for the dreamer
Wide-eyed believer
Counting stars on the ceiling
No sleep, no sleep
Replay, repeat
Sweetest fatigue
No sleep
No sleep

There's something big about to start
For the dreamer
Can't break the fever
No cure for the feeling
No sleep, no sleep for the dreamer
Wide-eyed believer
Counting stars on the ceiling
No sleep, no sleep
Replay, repeat
So long, so long, gravity
No sleep
No sleep
