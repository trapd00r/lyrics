Keepin' it real
World wide, baby
Limp Bizkit's in the house
To bring it on

I'd like to dedicate
This song to you
For making my dreams
Come true for the millennium

Are you ready
Then get the fuck up

Whoo-ha
Who's hot, who's not

Where you at Jacksonville
Rochester, Louisville
Columbia, Hartford
Milwaukee, and Lewiston Maine

Where you at
Providence, Nashville
Memphis, Lauderdale
Portland, Orlando, Chicago
And Frisco

I left my heart in Austin
With Mary Campbell
Got lost in Boston
Lookin' for the tea party

Met a child molester
In Worchester
Need a Kleenex every time
I'm leavin' Phoenix

I get silly when I play in Philly
Limp Bizkit committee down
In Kansas City

Never know what I'm in for
When I'm play in Denver
Hard Rock don't stop
Down in Vegas

In Cincinnati the girls
Call me daddy
And I probably ain't leavin'
The next time I'm in Cleveland

Found my lucky coin
In Des Moines
And spit on a boy named Tina
In Pasadena

We get the swing
From new Orleans
Fort Worth and Dallas
We toast when we're tippin'
Up the challis

Tulsa, St. Louis, Sacto, Mesa
Norfolk, Lawrence, Minneapolis
St. Paul, North Hampton, Detroit
Omaha, New York, L.A.

What can I say
I can't name 'em all
So somebody
Anybody
Everybody
Get the fuck up

Show me what you got
Whoo-ha
Show me what you got
Hey, ladies

Who's hot, who's not
Who, who
Who's hot, who's not

I can't help but believe
In these friends
These bands, these stories
And the places that I've been

I thank God
Mom and Dad
Adriana
For the love I feel inside

Jordan, my fat ass band
Without 'em I'd be nothin'
But a pumpkin shoved inside a can

Without the fans
There wouldn't be no show
And if that was really so
Than life would really blow

To the Firm
You always got my back
Korn for the love
And the swappin' of the tracks

My brother Cory D
My man Terry Date
We brought it to the plate
And you made it sound great

Scott Weiland
The melody man
If you can't sing it
Nobody can

Wu-Tang Clan
Skills from the Method
The world's best MC
Kills on this record

Slim Shady
Crazy ass cracker.
Staind, a brand new drug
For your brain

Les Claypool
For actin' like a fool
And all of the bands
For the demos that were kool

I'm so grateful
For this life of mine
The ones I didn't thank
I will some other time

Now I just want somebody
Anybody
Everybody
To get the fuck up

And show me what you got
Yeee-ha
Show me what you got
Hey, ladies

Who's hot, who's not
Who, who

Who's hot, who's not
Who's hot, baby

Who's hot

Uh
Yeah, Lethal
I like that beat

Uh
Bring it
Bring it

I've been around
This world and then some
Dum ditty dum kid
Where you comin' from

I went from the garage
To steppin' on these stages
Outrageous rhymes left my mind
And soon became contagious

An MC with bad habits I am
I see a mic then I grab it
It's scary, ain't it

Comin' raw with no corrections
Savin' all perfections
For what I do with my erections

So dream on
