This song is about you
Cause I can't live without you
when a song is about you
then you know you've got problems
that you can choose

There's a hole in my conscience
There's a hole in my country
like a nose that keeps running
like a hose that won't stop flowing
and I know that it's coming
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming soon

Here's why
Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drowning

(you should be looking out)

The morning will follow
and I wont remember

(you should be looking out)

It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever

(you should be looking out)

you should be looking out

In the fall I get lonely
In the winter I'm still lonely
Come the knives of the springtime
In the summer I go crazy

Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drowning

(you should be looking out)

The morning will follow
and I wont remember

(you should be looking out)

It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever

(you should be looking out)

you should be looking out
