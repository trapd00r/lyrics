When he opens the door says I'm home
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They'll tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been

There'll be times he won't say a word
And you'll wonder if its something you said
A gentle touch of your hand
Will tell him you understand

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart 
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart 
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
