And you're like a 90's Jesus
And you revel in your psychosis
How dare you?
And you sample concepts like hors d'oeuvres
And you eat their questions for dessert
Is it just me or is it hot in here?

And you're like a 90's Kennedy
And you're really a million years old.
You can't fool me.
They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites
Is it just me or is it dark in here?

You may never be or have a husband
You may have or hold a child
You will learn to lose everything
We are temporary arrangements

And you're like a 90's Noah
And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things
And they wonder why you're frustrated
And they wonder why you're so angry
Is it just me or are you fed up?

And God bless you in your travels, in your conquests, and queries
