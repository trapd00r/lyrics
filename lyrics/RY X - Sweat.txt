Come, husk your limbs to my floor
Bones sucking stones, her coming storm
Under the lights you went
Chemical ashes head down
Heart on a diamond thread
Fennel and lashes wet down
Ouuuuh Ouuuuuuh X2
Young star, hanuted lynx
Ring of silver om
I want your bones inside my bones
Under the lights we went
Wearing our chimes we bled out
Fennel and lashes wet
Heart on a diamond thread now
Your making me sweat, sweat, sweat my love down deep into your bones
Your making me sweat, sweat, sweat my heart down deep into your soul
I can't take it
Ouuuuh Ouuuuuuh X4
Your making me sweat, sweat, sweat my love down deep into your bones
Your making me sweat, sweat, sweat my heart down deep into your soul
I can't take it, I can take it...
