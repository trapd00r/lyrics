If I could
Give anything I could
If my thoughts could do you good

If I could help you with
This spart of life you've got to live
You could load your weight on me

If I meant to you
What you mean to me
Your fight would also me
The greatest thing
You could do for me

If I knew
When your pain be shining through
I could be watching over you

If I'd been close
I could reach the things to use
And know just what to do

One thing I will do
To never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
