Ok, whassup, this ya boy 50 cent
Yeah,
And it's goin' down right here, you heard me?
I'm Craaaazy,
Aftermath,
G-Unot!

Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit
The hood only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Stop the singin' and let's get back to some killa shit
Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit
The hood only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Stop the singin' and let's get back to some killa shit

Step up in the club they like, "Who you with?"
I'm signed to Dr. Dre not G-Unit
Red rag in my pocket, feel that old school
You forgot how bullets feel? I'm'a show you
I'm a gangsta I do what I want to
Your time is up nigga, I done warned you
You got the police with you nigga, don't trip
I got a box of doughnuts and a whole clip
When it's time for beef, he gets his drink on
Animal Rights said kill him with that mink on
I'ma kick it by the car till its time to go
And I won't leave the scene till the police show

Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit
The hood only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Stop this singin' and let's get back to some killa shit
Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit
The hood only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Stop the singin' and let's get back to some killa shit

Remember 50 comin' out your stereo?
He sounded gangsta till he switched his flow
How many times I try to get you to hit the smoke?
Stop lying to the people, you don't twist the dro!
My TEC is snit, my clip is long
And the Bloods and Crips is on you, dawg
They must've heard that you a ho
Got G-Unit airbrushed on your toe
I bring the pump in the club 'cause I'm hurting kid
And I do these rap beefs all the time, man
They say at Summerjam I turned it out
But Kanye and Hova killed it without a doubt
The rat came out dancing like a pro man
Punch him in the face the crowd was like "Oh, man!"
Four months ago I was yellin' G-Unit,
Till I found out the nigga 5-0 was a snitch!
Now...

Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit
The hood only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Stop the singin' and let's get back to some killa shit
Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit
The hood only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Stop the singin' and let's get back to some killa shit
