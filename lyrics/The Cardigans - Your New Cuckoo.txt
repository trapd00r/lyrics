I saw you there
I stopped and stared
The curly girlie smile
You really were
Too close to her
And people just went by

I saw your face
And her embrace
Your whisper in her ear
I know the score
'Cause I've heard it before
I read your lips with fear

Your words were clear (you said:)

La-la-la-la-la-la
Let's say forever, let's say it's true
La-la-la-la-la-la
Let's come together, me and you
La-la-la-la-la-la
Your new cuckoo
