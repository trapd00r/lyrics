Dance, yes; (RedOne...)
Love, next.

Shimmy shimmy yah, shimmy yam, shimmy yay;
I'm a ol' dirty dog all day...
No way, José!
Your girl only go one way? Ay, mi madre...
You should check that out;
Maybe you ain't turn her out...
Maybe it's none of my business,
But for now work it out, let's get this, dalé...

Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside;
I find it so stupid, so why should I hide
That I love to make love to you, baby? 
(Yeah... make love to me.)

So many ways, wanna touch you tonight...
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time;
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby...
(Yeah... make love to me.)

If this would be a perfect world, we'd be together then;
(Let's do it, do it, do it...)
Only got just one life, this I've learned - Who cares what they're gonna say?
(Let's do it, do it, do it...)

I wanna dance, and love, and dance again...
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again...

Dance, yes;
Love, next.
Dance, yes;
Love, next.

Baby, your fire is lighting me up;
The way that you move, boy, is reason enough
That I love to make love to you, baby...
(Yeah... make love to me.)

I can't behave - oh, I want you so much;
Your lips taste like Heaven, so why should I stop?
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby...
(Yeah... make love to me.)

If this would be a perfect world, we'd be together then;
(Let's do it, do it, do it...)
Only got just one life, this I've learned - Who cares what they're gonna say?
(Let's do it, do it, do it...)

I wanna dance, and love, and dance again...
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again...

Mr. Worldwide, and the world's most beautiful woman.

Modern day Hugh Hef - uh, yes.
Playboy to the death - uh, yes.
Is he really worldwide? Uh, yes?
Mami, let me open your treasure chest...
Play dates, we play mates;
I'm the king snatching queens, checkmate...
What you think? It's a rumor;
I'm really out of this world - moon, luna!
Make women comfortable, call me bloomer;
Can't even show love, 'cause they'll sue ya...
But I told them, "Hallelujah, have a blessed day."
So ahead of myself, everyday's yesterday.
Want the recipe? It's real simple.
Little bit of vole, and she'll open sesame...

Now dance, yes;
Love, next.
Dance, yes;
Love, next.

If this would be a perfect world, we'd be together then;
(Let's do it, do it, do it...)
Only got just one life, this I've learned - Who cares what they're gonna say?
(Let's do it, do it, do it...)

I wanna dance, and love, and dance again...
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again...
