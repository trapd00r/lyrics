Time, melting fast
In a room where the sun is burning dust from our past
It's a huge carnaval
In my chest
I didn't know anything,
A carpet floor boy
And the king of land
Where all the small things seems so very grand

I'm leaving tonight
Here comes the chuchu, come on
Steaming to you through the gone times
Nostalgia locomotive
It gives you a hell of a ride

Here comes the chuchu, come on
Steaming to you through the gone times
Nostalgia locomotive
It gives you a hell of a ride

Time, floating fast
In the odd world
The rain is pouring memories from my past
It's a huge carnaval
In my chest
I didn't know anything,
A rubber boot girl
And the queen of land
Where all the small things seems so very grand

I'm leaving tonight
Here comes the chuchu, come on
Steaming to you through the gone times
Nostalgia locomotive
It gives you a hell of a ride

Here comes the chuchu, come on
Steaming to you through the gone times
Nostalgia locomotive
It gives you a hell of a ride
