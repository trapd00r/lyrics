Yeea, 
Im sending this one out to anyone who's had to wait on a money transfer, yea its kinda whack when they charge you like 10 percent on the dollar but you know how good it feels when they say.. 

(chorus) 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 

the worst thing is the waiting man, 
its spiritually draining, 
i guess i could repaint it, but dont think im complaing, 
im in my small apartment, 
this month has been the hardest 
i couldn't afford some omelets, 
im broke like an empty promise 
sometimes when im in a meeting, and everyone else is eating, 
I feel so awkward asking, so i pretend like i am fasting, 
my girl had paid my payments, 
she wants to save my anus, 
she says my loves contagious but my pride is so outrageous 
she sent me Western Union, so i can make it doin 
it felt so good when she said write down this eleven digits 
i go out to receive it, i'm desperate and i need it, 
feels like an angel's speaking, I can hardly believe it 

(chorus) 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 

You finally got a cola, you met him in sarpola 
a tourist with a dollar, he's some kind of a baller 
two babies in a stroller, and still he wants to hollar 
he likes your pepsi-cola, but you aint runnin Lola 
Brazil aint nothin easy, for velez or fa sheezy 
the sun would make you dizzy, 
workin for something measly 
these girls would make you trust em, 
and sweetness is the custom, 
but everyday they hustlin, everyday they hustlin, 
John calls her with the number, 
home with her local lover, 
who was it that picked up the phone, 
oh that was just my brother 
she goes out to recieve it she's desperate and she needs it 
its like an angel speaking, she can barely believe it 

(chorus) 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 

I got my confirmation, 
the western union agent, 
said grandmas destination, 
had violent inclination 
but now im proud and pacing, 
and walking to the station, 
heavy precipitation, 
but you cant me anything, 
i got my bills in order, 
i made it cross the border, 
such dazzles such a horror, 
his life was like an Oprah, 
Grandma i never forget you, 
worry i never let you, 
soon as i leave the venue, 
this money i will send you, 
I still havnt gone astray, 
dont drink or smoke and sway, 
though sometimes i dont pray, 
it feels so good to say, 
go out and recieve it, 
cuz i just know you need it, 
Your boy has grown up decent, 
grandma can you believe it? 

(chorus) 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away. 
You can pick it up today, its 15 minutes away.
