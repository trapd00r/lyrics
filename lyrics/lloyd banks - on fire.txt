(Lloyd Banks Talking)
New York City
You are now rockin with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin hot
We on fire
Shawty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire
(Nigga wutchu say?)
We gettin loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire

(Verse 1 - LLoyd Banks)
Naw I aint puttin nuttin' out, I smoke when I wanna
26 inch chrome spokes on a Hummer
This heat gon' last for the whole summer
Runnin your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buyin diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin is your hair
Yeah, I'm ridin with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists gettin wrong deals
I'm only 21, sittin on mill's

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin hot
We on fire
Shawty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire
(Nigga what you say?)
We gettin loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire

(Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks)
If you know anythin about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I 'ont hit the first night, I aint gon' call her
I'm tryna play, you tryna have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care 'bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't puttin no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend' quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't biast when I'm ridin through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say somethin, I ain't a mind reader

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin hot
We on fire
Shawty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire
(Nigga what you say?)
We get loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire
