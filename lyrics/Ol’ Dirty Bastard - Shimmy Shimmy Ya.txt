"Aw, I don't want to fuck you. You can't even sing!"
You had to sing, or
Something, to get some pussy

Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw

Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad

Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill

Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground
For any MC in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer. Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage then I dip down

(I like the way you talk)

Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw

Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw

[The first verse in reverse]

Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad

Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill

Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard, quick cement to the ground
For any MC in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer. Norman Bates
My producer slam, flow is like bam
Jump on stage then I dip down

Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, yeah
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shi shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shimmy shi-shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay

Give me the mic so I can take it away, shimmy shimmy ya

You can't even sing. You have to sing or something to get some pussy
