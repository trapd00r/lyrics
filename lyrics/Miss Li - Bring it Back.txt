Oh Danny boy, how could love go so wrong?
Why did it end up that way?
How could we be such a fools, young teenage fools.
Oh Danny boy, we were too young too talk,
We were too dumb too walk.
But that was many years ago, both you and I know,
That we're still in love.

So let's bring it back, to what we used too be.
So let's bring it back, back too you and me.

Oh, Sicely.
It was you and me, yeah we were young and free.
But I don't know what went wrong, I was on my own.
How can it be, so hard when everything is right?
We turned the love into a night, we turned the love into a fight, ooh yeah.
But we're still in love.

Let's bring it back, to what we used too be.
Let's bring it back, back to you and me.
Let's bring it back, back to you and me.
Let's bring it back, ooh, back too you and me.

Talking:

All right.

Come on.

It hasn't been, not a single day, without you in my head.
Let our young fight be dead, all the stupid things we said,
'Cause we're still in love.

Ooh, let's bring it back, too what we used too be.
Let's bring it back, back to you and me.
Let's bring it back, to what we used too be.
Let's bring it back, back to you and me.
Let's bring it back, back to you and me.
Oh, let's bring it back, back to you and me.

Talking:

That's right.

Talking Lower:

Come on.
Ooh.
