Skinny was born in a bathtub
And he grew so incredibly 
Even the end of an eyedropper
Sucked him in

Skinny never knew any questiong
Skinny never looked at the lights
But Skinny sold something
Every single night 

Skinny sold a soldier to me
Skinny sold a wife 
Skinny sold a suction cup 
And a knife 
Skinny found a Hello Dolly 
Record in the hall
He sold it to a truck driver
In the fall
