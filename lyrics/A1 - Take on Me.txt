Talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shine away
I'll be coming for your love OK

Take on me, (take on me)
Take me on, (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
At odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK.
Say it after me
It's so much better to be safe than sorry

Take on me, (take on me)
Take me on, (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Yeah is it life or just a play
My worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You shine away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me, (take on me)
Take me on, (take on me)
I'll be gone in a day or two
