Have you seen the movie yet
There's a lot about it in the press
It made me think of you
Did it make you think of me
Is it freezing over there
I'm opening a tree museum
It's my new hobby

Twenty-five thousand reasons
And you only needed one
Open season has begun, begun

I may be over in the spring
To do a little spring cleaning
I don't know where you are
But you're not on the old street
Where we got a place together
That was never my address
And here's the receipt

It's as though I lost my voice
I couldn't make you do it
And now I have no choice

Twenty-five thousand reasons
And you only needed one
Open season has begun, begun

There are many distractions
Sapping all my energy
Did you find the antique needles
And the money in the ceiling
No need to thank me
I left it where you'd find it
Above the oil of the Aegean Sea
