You are an obsession I cannot sleep
I am a possession I'm hoping that you'll feed
There's no balance no equality
But still, I will not accept defeat

I will have you, yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly, a wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me

I feed you I drink you, my day and my night
I need you I need you by sun or candlelight
You protest, you wanna leave
Stay, oh there's no alternative

Love is a bit of skin
I see the beauty there
But I see danger, stranger beware
A circumstance in your naked dreams
Your reflection is not what it seems

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me

My fantasy has turned to madness
And all my goodness has turned to badness
My need to possess you has consumed my soul
My life is trembling I have no control

I will have you, yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly, a wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you 

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me

You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession, you're my obsession
Who do you want me to be 
To make you sleep with me
