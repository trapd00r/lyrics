I'm a young man, baby
And a young man I must be
I've got to live young, baby
And love young, baby
And see what I can see

So remember that you can't tie a mustang down
No, you can't tie a mustang down
And you can't keep an ocean in a cup
Whoa no, you can't tie a mustang down or up

Now I only got one heart, baby
And I'm gonna keep it hid
Oh, by the way that I hold you
You might think I love you
But I never said I did

So don't impose your will upon me
I can't stand the sound of chains
Oh, don't try to tame me
Or blame me or name me
Oh baby, ease up on the reins

And remember that you can't (no you can't) tie a mustang down
No, you can't (no you can't) tie a mustang down
Oh, you can't put an ocean in a cup
Whoa, no, you can't tie a mustang down or up

Now I'm a young man, baby
And a young man I must be
I've got to live young, baby
And love young, baby
And see what I can see

So remember that you can't tie a mustang down
No, you can't tie a mustang down
Oh, you can't keep an ocean in a cup
Whoa no, you can't tie a mustang down or up
Whoa, no

You can't tie a mustang down
You can't tie a mustang down
You can't keep an ocean in a cup
Whoa no, you can't tie a mustang down or up
