Damian Marley:
As we enter
Come now we take you on the biggest adventure

Nas:
Must be dementia, that you ever thought
You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?

Damian Marley:
You be Jamrock the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals

Nas:
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news, we hood heroes

Damian Marley:
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka

Nas:
And I got the guns

Damian Marley:
I got the ganja

Nas:
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up

Damian Marley:
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals

Nas:
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois
And I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
Habari gani

Damian Marley:
Nzuri sana
Switch up the language and move to Ghana

Nas:
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers

Damian Marley:
Rhythm piranhas

Nas:
Like true Obamas, unfold the drama

Nas:
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

Damian Marley:
Queens to Kingston

Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom

Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant

Damian Marley:
And I can hear the sound of a voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen

Nas:
Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself
And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it

Damian Marley:
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent

Nas:
That's how you end up in a hitlist

Damian Marley:
Ain't no bad man business

Nas:
No evidence

Damian Marley:
Crime scene, fingerprint-less

Nas:
Flow effortless

Damian Marley:
Casual like the weekends

Nas:
No pressure when

Damian Marley:
We're comfy and decent

Nas:
We set this off beasting

Damian Marley:
Hunting season

Nas:
And, frankly speaking...
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
