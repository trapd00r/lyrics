Oh, had I a golden thread
And a needle so fine
I'd weave a magic strand
Of rainbow design
Of rainbow design

In it I'd weave the bravery
Of women giving birth
In it I'd weave the innocence
Of children of all the earth
Children of all the earth

Show my brothers and sisters
My rainbow design
Bind up this sorry world
With hand and heart and mind
Hand and heart and mind

Oh, far over the water
I'd reach my magic band
To every human being
So they would understand
So they'd understand

Oh, had I a golden thread
And a needle so fine
I'd weave a magic strand
Of rainbow design
Of rainbow design
