I don't mind spending some time just hanging here with you
'Cause I don't find too many guys that treat me like you do
Those other guys all wanna take me for a ride
But when I walk, they talk of suicide
Some people never get beyond their stupid pride
But you can see the real me inside, and I'm satisfied
Oh, no, oh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

I could be your confidante
Just one of your girlfriends
But I know that's not what you want if tomorrow the world ends
Why shouldn't we be with the one we really love?
Now tell me, who have you been dreaming of?
I, and I alone
Oh, no, oh

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do
Maybe I'm perfect for you

Excuse me for feeling this moment is critical
It might be, we feel it
It could get physical
Oh, no, no, no

Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
If you show me real love, baby, I'll show you mine
I can make it nice and naughty
Be the devil and angel too
Got a heart and soul and body
Let's see what this love can do

Let's see what love can do, oh
(Maybe I'm perfect for you, maybe I'm perfect for you)
You, maybe I'm perfect for you
Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
Even though the gods are crazy
Even though the stars are blind
