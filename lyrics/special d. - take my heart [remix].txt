You'll always be my baby
I'm always thinkin of you baby

Touch me in the mornin
and last thing at night
keep my body warm baby, u know it feels right

We cant always understand what we are shown

You touch my mind in special places
my heart races with you
i'll take your love and i'll take my chances
I'll take them with you
