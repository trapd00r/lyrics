I'm here to paint what's written on ya face
'Cause these are the days we are losing our ways
To find better ways to say what nobody says

'Cause we are living on the edge and my motorcycle's speeding
It is what it is and this is how I'm feeling

Today-a-a-aa-ay
It is what it is shorty

I got effected but I effect alot more
They all got issues but I got a bit more
I put it in boxes and I put it in a store
I hope you really like it I can do you some more

Yeah I'm gonna say something
Even if you think it's nothing
'Cause one day you are gonna say that
Today was bumping

Today-a-a-aa-ay
It is what it is shorty

Maybe it's just us or maybe it just me
We can have discussions while we are playin' Wii
Maybe it's just us or maybe it just me
