He's the one who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along, and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean, knows not what it mean
And I say, he's the one who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along, and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean, knows not what it mean

He's the one who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along, and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean, knows not what it mean
And I say, he's the one who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along, and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean, knows not what it mean
And I say, yeah

He's the one who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along, and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean, knows not what it mean
And I say, he's the one who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along, and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean, knows not what it mean
And I say, yeah
