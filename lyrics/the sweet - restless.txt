You know I've tried to cool it
I've been trying to settle down
But when I think I'm made it
It drives me crazy
Well I'm staying on the wild side
Always hit the higher ground
Nothing I do could amaze me

I'm (I'm)
So (So)
Restless (Restless)
So restless (Restless)
You know it's a too late now (Too late, too late)
Too late now (Too late now)
Too late now (Too late, too late)
Too late now (Too late now)

Well I've always been outrageous
But a change has gotta come
Making up my mind was never easy
I was born to late to love you
The day will never come
It's love that I need so don't tease me

I'm (I'm)
So (So)
Restless (Restless)
So restless (Restless)
You know it's a too late now (Too late, too late)
Too late now (Too late now)
Too late now (Too late, too late, too late)
Too late now

I'm (I'm)
So (So)
Restless (Restless)
So restless (Restless)
I gotta tell ya that it's a
Too late now (Too late, too late now)
Too late now (Oh yeah, it's too late, too late)
Too late now (Oh)
Too late now (I gotta tell ya)
Too late now (Too late, too late now)
Too late now (Too late now)
Too late now (Oh, hmmm)
Too late now (Too late, too late)
