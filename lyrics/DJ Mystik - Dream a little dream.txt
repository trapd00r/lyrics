Escape to paradise 
'Cause there is heaven in your eyes 
We'll fly on angel's wings 
Above the clouds and rainbowings. 
Escape to paradise 
And I see heaven in your eyes 
Your love will set me free 
From now until eternity 

I hear you calling 
Calling out my name 
In the moonlight shadow baby 
You'll take away the pain 
Lets stay together 
Forever and always 
We're on a journey 
A million miles away 

Chorus 

I feel the magic 
The magic of the night 
In dreams of passion baby 
We'll leave the world behind 
Your heart is beating 
beating next to mine 
wrap your arms around me 
until the end of time
