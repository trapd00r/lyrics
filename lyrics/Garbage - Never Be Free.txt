You'll never be free
You'll never be free

This is the place where dreams begin
I wait right here for you, my friend
I shiver underneath your skin
A brazen thief who walks right in

You can beat yourself up to the beat of a drum
You can drink till you drop, till you can't stand up
And it tastes so sweet, it tastes so sweet

You'll never forgive me, you'll never be free
You might as well kill me, you'll never be free
You'll never forgive me, you'll never be free
You might as well kill me, you'll never be free

I'll be your master heroine
Your mother's milk, your adrenaline
Are you a hunter just like me?
A lot of heart, a little crazy

You can beat yourself up to the beat of the drum
You can drink till you drop, till you can't stand up
And it tastes so sweet, tastes so sweet

You'll never forgive me, you'll never be free
You might as well kill me, you'll never be free
You'll never forgive me, you'll never be free
You might as well kill me, you'll never be, never be free

Your house, your room, your mouth, your bed
Your ear, your heart, your veins, your blood
In your house, your room, your mouth, your bed
Your ear, your heart, your veins, your blood

You'll never be free
You'll never be, never be free
You'll never be free
You'll never be, never be free

You'll never forgive me
You might as well kill me
