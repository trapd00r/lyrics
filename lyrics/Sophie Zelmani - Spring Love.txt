Love you meet in the springtime
Is rarely love you can keep
Fall in the winter
For the sheet of snow got a deep

Spring love that lasts through summer
Surely will be standing like a fool
So fall in the winter
When the heart ain’t so easy sold

Summer love you’re still feeling
Will hurt every time a leaf falls
So fall in the winter
For the longest season of them all
