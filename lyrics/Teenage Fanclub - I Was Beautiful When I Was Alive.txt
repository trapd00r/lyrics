What if I could sail away
From this island of imagined yesterdays
What if I could fly away
I'd be flying higher than high

Because I was beautiful when I was alive
Going to close my eyes

Sail on through imagination
I don't expect no explanation

I was beautiful when I was alive
Open up my eyes

I was beautiful when I was alive
Beautiful when I was alive

What are you going to do (I'm not selling out)
What are you going to do about it (My imagination)
What are you going to do (I'm a citizen)
What are you going to do about it (Of the human nation)
