Someday my peace will come
Oh I know my peace will come
I will sleep like a child without pain - without fear
Like a smile in the afternoon sun
Oh someday my peace will come

Lord can you hear me - Oh I know you know my name
It's written in the tears - That flow from my pain
Broken hearted broken soul
All my life on the run
But someday Yeah someday
My peace will come
Someday my peace will come
