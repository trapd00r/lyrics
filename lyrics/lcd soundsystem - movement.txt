It's like a movement from the small place to a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a culture without the effort of all of the culture

Oh, but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday and I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

It's like a movement without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a t-shirt doing all the singing
It's like a couple dads and a few friends trying hard to stay in

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy and I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results, well, I'm tapped

Here comes the report, nothing to report, see, it's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment, well, it pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the t-shirt doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research, doing all the blame

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast asleep and I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results, well, I'm tapped

It's like the culture without the effort of all of the luggage
It's like a discipline without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a movement without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a culture without the culture of all of the culture

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy and I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're finicky, I'm tapped
