[Hook x2]
California is cold, I guess you didn't know
See when the sun sets, the shivers start to grow
Go forward, press down any road
Been around the world and still I wound up back home

[Verse 1: Bless]
Out the wild west gun show, smoggy and gun smoke
Land of a million prayers, but there's only one hope
No one left to trust when your love becomes a cut-throat
Another boxer knocked out on himself with his jump rope
Lungs full of dope smoke roasting
Toast to my folks who hold me close with devotion
Middle finger, rusty knives, to liars who have spoken
Trying to cut an open, space for me to float in
These days don't pace like they used to
Every day I find and I lose you
Walking down these streets singing songs
Where the sidewalk never ends
And they never lead home, bleeding out a palm
From the wrist all alone while I'm stoned in the morning
Trying to turn it into gold before my heart's frozen
Standing in the garden full of roses
While my twin brother is in the ground decomposing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bless]
The weather's gotta change though, can't always stay cold
Sunburned skin, two horns and a halo
Hanging with these beasts while I'm waiting on my angel
Every morning Mary Jane and I wake up and tango
No wonder where the pain goes
Give me all the pot and gold, ya'll can keep the rainbows
Hope my arrows follow on exactly where my aim goes
If they don't say my name and go and light your candles
This fate don't fade like it used to
Every day I find and I lose you
Whatever light's at the bottom of these songs that I write
Disappears in the morning but it shines every night
I've been gone so long a lot of friends are now strangers
And I don't know the names of any of my neighbors
Started writing poems as I failed as a painter
Too sad for a ringer in this city named danger
And every avenue they'll meet your maker
I'll wake her just to kiss her in the morning time
I can't sing and yes we were born to die
Feeling borderline and bored at times
Afraid if my train left I didn't board in time
I stand still trying to remember life before the rhymes
And I find a diamond in my spine fortified
The Navajo blanket here to keep me warm inside
Ignore the warning signs, the real war is inside, the real war is I
Staring at this boring sky
California is cold and this is Bless for life
