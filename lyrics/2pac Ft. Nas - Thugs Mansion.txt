Shit tired of getting shot at 
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested 
Nigga's need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong that's just for us 
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion........ A place to spend my quiet nights
Time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times 
I once contemplated suicide
And woulda tried but
when I held that nine all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle
They only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survive Praying hard for better days promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't got a choice but to role on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we could drink liquor and no one pickers over trick shit
A spot where we could smoke in peace
And even though we G's we still visualize places that we can roll on pieces
And in my mind's eyes I can see this place where players go and pass
And got a spot for us all so we can ball in thug mansion (Chorus)
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
In a sky high iced out paradise 
In the sky (Thug mansion) Ain't no place I'd rather be
The only place that's right for me
In a chromed out mansion in paradise
In the sky Will I survive all the fights and the darkness troubled spots?
Tell my homies where the heart is here to party
I shed tattoos tears and couldn't sleep good for multiple years
With these tears cast gun shots 
Nobody cares See the politicians band us
They'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me 2 change? 
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain I need a place to rest my head 
With a little bit of home boys that remain
'Cuz all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll if you find it?
I'll be right behind you 
Show me and I'll go I can not be peaceful
I'm coming from the bottom
Watching my Daddy scream peace
While the other man shot him
I need a house just for the love
When I need to escape the very places selling drugs
In thug mansion (Chorus) Dear mother don't cry your baby boy's gonna be good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and I ain't got hoods
Seen this show with Marvin Gay last night
It had me shook dripping peppermint snot
With Jakey Wilson and Sam Cook Then some lady named Billy Holiday sang
Sitting there kicking it with Malcom till the day came
Little Latasha, she'd grown tell the lady in the liquor store
That she's forgiven so come home Maybe in time you'll understand only God could save us
When my baby's cutting loose wit the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, lay in heaven, found peace at last Picture a place that they exist, together
It has to be a place better then this, in heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking:
Remember this face, save me a place
In thug mansion.
