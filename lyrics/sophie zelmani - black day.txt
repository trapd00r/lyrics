Was it easy, was it hard?
We will always wonder about that part
Were you crazy, were you brave?
That's what we all wonder about today

We will live through this black day
We will pray by your young grave
We will live through this black day
We will stand by your black grave

Were you obsessed or just low?
Now we talk about how come it never showed
What did you seek but couldn't find?
And when, did we all slip your mind?

We will live through this black day
We will pray by your young grave
We will live through this black day
We will stand by your black grave

We will live through this black day
We will pray by your young grave
We will live through this black day
We will stand by your young grave
