I sit awake alone again.
Today we nearly lost a friend.
The clouds hang in the sky, stripping me of life.
It seems we've all fallen away.
Seeking the merchants of decay.
You said we'd never die, now kindly hold my eye and say-

Don't be leaving,
I'm half of what you made us,
Let's brave the night another day.
I'll be leading,
A torch light in the dark, we'll get out,
And find another way.

I wander roads and feel the cold.
The magic gone I'm feeling old.
The ghosts of what I've done, are mocking everyone.
Their voices penetrate the haze,
It's starting to become me.

Don't be leaving,
I'm half of what you made us,
Let's brave the night another day.
I'll be leading,
A torch light in the dark, we'll get out,
And find another way.

It's time to testify,
The Gods above will wait forever to find a soul as pure as you or I.
I'm leaving when I die.
The full corrosion of my spirit shapes the person I will give my life.
It's time to testify, or live out the end.

Don't be leaving,
I'm half of what you made us,
Let's brave the night another day.
I'll be leading,
A torch light in the dark, we'll get out,
And find another way.
