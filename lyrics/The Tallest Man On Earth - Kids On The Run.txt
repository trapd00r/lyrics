Oh, meet me when the morning fails on the fields of desire
Oh, meet me when I lost my part in the choir of dusk
Where the promise to lead what is right
As we both know how fields will turn white

And know I will never speak of days
'Cause I know you won't count them
No, we have never grown a day from the poison we shared
And we're walking our crooked path home
But will we ever confess what we've done?
Yes, we're still kids on the run

And, no, we will never be a part of the pictures once taken
When we're feeding fire with the flames 'til no memory's gone
And the cold sky will write us a song
But will we ever confess what we've done?
Yes, we're still kids on the run

And the reflections in their eyes
Sure could paint us as killers
Oh, I'll be there

And 'til the terror of our time
Could forgive us as lovers
Oh, let's break some hearts

And, no, I will never speak of ways 'cause I know you won't try them
But all the weapons raining from the sky will be ours to embrace
And the cold sky will write us a song
But will we ever confess what we've done?
Yes, we're still kids on the run
