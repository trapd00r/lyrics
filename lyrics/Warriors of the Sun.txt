We are the Warriors of the Sun
We are the Warriors of the Sun

If it's true about no more water but the fire next time
Will the children of the eighties be ashes or live to their prime
If we don't heed reasonable people and their warnings of days to come
We'll all be incinerated Warriors of the Sun

We'll be there to feed the hungry and to tend to the sick
We'll be there when the night gets black and the going gets thick
We'll be there to carry your feeble, your hopeless and your weary ones
We are the Warriors of the Sun

The black angel of Memphis is by our side
He walked and he talked in truth until the day that he died
He said, "It ain't what you can do for me, ah, but what can I do for thee?"
And he took us to the mountaintop and he set us free

We are the Warriors of the Sun
We may be crazy
And it may be our final run
We are the Warriors of the Sun

Everybody knows that the whale is smarter than we
Probably that's why we call him the king of the sea
We're killing everything on dry land, why don't we just let the fishes be
Some of us are Greenpeace Warriors of the Sea

We are the Warriors of the Sun
We are the Warriors of the Sun
We are the Warriors of the Sun
We are the Warriors of the Sun
