[12 seconds fades-in/instrumental]

[Lloyd Bank$:]
Too much thinkin' on top of that, I'm gettin' high and drinkin'.
I'm floatin'! - On cloud 9 watchin' these niggas sinkin'.
No blinkin'! - You blink too much, you lose your turn.
Sleep is the cousin of death. - You might as well pick your urn!
I been talkin' my intentions, now it's time to go and do it;
Take you were I come from. - That influence on my music.
Ain't no u-turns on this path! - Think before you choose it;
Hold this autograph, come get your cash and try to use it!
I came here unexpected. (I came here unexpected!) - I'm a leave a' legend. (I'm a leave a' legend!)
Brought up in this hell. (brought up in this hell!) - How I'm breathin' heaven? (I'm breathin' heaven!)
I swear, I fear, I hear my niggas laughin' while I'm ballin';
Woke up this mornin' the weed and alcohol callin'.
Livin' that life of a Mack; (uhh!) kickin' them hoes out off 'em,
Ask 'em when they comin' back. - Knowin' that they done lost 'em!
Hit them bitches from the back. - I ain't want all the talkin',
Don't be blown at my jack. - Flatline on that cat! (flatline on that cat!)

[Chorus: Lloyd Bank$]
Let's get this money! (get this money!) - Then let's make it stack! (let's make it stack!)
Then let's make history, 'cause they can't take that back! (take that back!)
Back to ballin' and spendin'! (ballin' and spendin'!) - Runnin' up in these women. (in these women!)
Got a bitch out the movie; take a look how I'm livin'! (uhh!)
And do you know what it took? (what it took!) - I take you back down the road, (down the road!)
Before the riches and bitches, - and the platinum and gold. (platinum and gold!)
I got it all from the work. - No contract in my soul!
I don't ball/bawl up and die, I bomb back on them hoes!

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uhh! - I'm tryna buy my soul from Satan. - I can't keep up with payments! (true!)
Strange writings on the waaall (waaall!) got me feelin' like a cavemen. (all right!)
Call that shit the "Days Inn". (uhh!) - Life is so degradin'. (uhh!)
But to my last statement, I keep praying till it's "Amen"! (uhh!)
Top is where I'm aimin'. (yeah!) - Left the way I came in;
I'm a keep on ravin' till them islands is the caymens, (uhh!)
And my bitch from Mexico. (Mexico!) - She don't know she next to go. (next to go!)
Suit yourself, then screw yourself! - Shoot yourself, plexicooo!
Bang, bang! - Thought you were a giant. (uhh!)
Couldn't hear the mornings, but I bet you hear them sirens. (uhh!)
First I close my eyelids, (yeah!) - then everything is quiet. (quiet!)
I could go out in silence, but I would prefer the riot. (yeah!)
I catch the first star with my fist raised, Versace shades, my french braids
Had sick chains since 6th grade - safe to say we've been slaved.
These niggas tryna shoot me! (uh-huuuh!) - These crackers tryna sue me! (yeah!)
Wake up to your favourite actresses; my life is like a movie, boy! (uhh!)

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Bank$:]
Heat up in the winter, so I'm cooler come the summer.
We out here, - gamblin' the Ruger money, sucker!
PYT and all we up the Cougar, I'm a crush her;
And I always been a rebel. - Never been a cuffer!
You just talk it, you don't does it;
To all those who suffer,
You so humble out in public. - Computer make you tougher!
I got Ros√© by the bottle, - bitches by the Car-Load,
6 or 7 new ones. - I'm switchin' up the mob!
Bitch, I sleep in the Apollo. - I'm always on stage; (uh!)
I should take my show to broadway 'cause that hallway like a grave. (frave!)
Can't no bitch get in my miiind! (miiind!) - So I know it's physical;
I kick out the dimes. - I think I'm invincible!
I climbed to the top, - now I'm pissin' off the pinnacle;
I pray to God that I get rich. - Gettin' money spiritual!
Diamond in my physicals. - That's why I'm a stand out,
You don't got your hand in. - You just got you hand out! (you just got you hand out, son!)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lloyd Bank$]
I bomb back on them hoes... [echoes]
I bomb back on them hoes... [echoes]
I bomb back on them hoes... [echoes]
I bomb back on them hoes... [echoes] [beat fades-out]
