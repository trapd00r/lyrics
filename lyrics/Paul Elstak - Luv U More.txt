You can make the sun turn purple 
You can make the seeds unfertile 
But you know you could never make me love you more 

You can turn wine into water 
And sadness into laughter 
But you know you could never make me love you more 

Let the suns fall down 
Let the leaves turn brown 
So you know you could never make me love you more 

Let the rainwood die 
Let the wells run dry 
So you know you could never make me love you more
