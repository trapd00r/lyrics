I'm up here somewhere so high in the climb
Too many people running loose in the mind
Send us a king or someone else that can bring
Some order where otherwise everything is

Eye for an eye, truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
You would be blind if you only knew
It was eye for an eye and truth for a truth

Pack up your wagon girl and button your coat
Look up and see me coming out of the smoke
Footprints of angels leaving tracks in the snow
I'm the last man that sweetheart you oughta know

When it's eye for an eye and truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
You would be blind if you only knew
It was eye for an eye and truth for a truth

It's good to be hungry
The apple of somebody's eye
Ain't nothing so pretty in this terrible light
All hands on deck and all men to the tower
I'm a virtueless man in the midnight hour

Now it's junk on junk, this bed that we made
Where I sleep like a horse standing up on the clay
Got to be ready, there's so much hell to pay
And I'm guilty of loving you in the worst kind of way

Eye for an eye, truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
You would be blind if you only knew
It was eye for an eye and truth for a truth
