I've got a couple more years on you babe, and that's all
I've had more chances to fly, and more places to fall
And it ain't that I'm wiser, it's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all

I've walked a couple more roads than you babe and that's all
And I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl
And you're heading somewhere, but I've been to somewhere and found it was nowhere at all
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all

Now saying goodbye girl, don't never come easy at all
But you've gotta fly 'cause you're hearing them young eagles call
And someday when you're older you'll smile at a man strong and tall
And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you babe and that's all

You'll say I've got a couple more years on you babe, and that's all
I've had more chances to fly, and more places to fall
And it ain't that I'm wiser, it's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all
