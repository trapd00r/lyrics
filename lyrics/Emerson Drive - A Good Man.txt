I don't need a whole lot of money
But I wouldn't turn a lottery down
I just need a little green in my pocket
So I can buy my buddies a round
All I want is a place to lay my head with the woman I love lyin' in my bed
Kind of understated
My dreams aren't that complicated...

I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife, and always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
I want everyone to gather 'round
And say he was a father, brother, neighbour and a friend
He was a good man!

I used to dream of being a rock star
And seein' the world in style
Used to dream of havin' a fast car
And driving that miracle mile
But I've heard tales those streets aren't paved in gold
They're full of pot holes and empty souls
Who never learn...
Love is something you gotta earn

I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife, and always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
Want everyone to gather 'round
And say he was a father, brother, neighbour and a friend
He was a good man!

When I'm gone, I wanna leave a legacy
Of love and laughs and honesty behind me
Behind me...

I wanna be the one
When all is said and done
Who lived a good life, loved a good wife, and always helped someone in trouble
On the day they lay me down
Want everyone to gather 'round
And say he was a father, brother, neighbour and a friend
He was a good man...

Yaaaaa... I wanna be a good man... a father, a brother, a neighbour, and a friend
I wanna be a good man!
