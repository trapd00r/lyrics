[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm fallin' in love with all this money, you know I'ma pick that shit over you
I just started fuckin' up my money, that's just somethin' that was too overdue, yeah
Never gave a fuck, I'm still a youngin, you know I'ma do what I wanna do
It's no turnin' back, my heart turnin' black, my hundreds are blue

[Verse 1]
I been down bad so long, it was drivin' me crazy
My brother tryna rob, no job, ridin' with a 380, yeah
Gotta get my check up like a nurse, I ain't tryna be patient, no
This is an emergency, you know that I ain't 'bout to keep waitin'
Ayy, pick apart the pieces of the puzzle in my brain
Came up from the struggle so the hustle in my veins
Ayy, I remember runnin' after busses in the rain
Now I run away from all my troubles in the rain
Ayy, I endure the pain to keep the people entertained
Ayy, it's a lot of lame, a lot of weak shit in the game
Ayy, I remain the same, a lot of people tend to change
I'm on the road to riches and I'm speedin' through the lanes
I'm fallin' in love with all that money, nigga
Try to take it from me, you a dummy, nigga
Laughin' to the bank, I'm such a fu-, I'm such a funny nigga

[Chorus]
I'm really fallin' in love with all this money, you know I'ma pick that shit over you
I just started fuckin' up my money, that's just somethin' that was too overdue, yeah
Never gave a fuck, I'm still a youngin, you know I'ma do what I wanna do
It's no turnin' back, my heart turnin' black, my hundreds are blue

[Verse 2]
Heart broken by a woman so cold, uh
It feels new but this shit is so old, thought
We were connected 'til the day we grow old, but
That ho gone, all my feelings postponed
All these niggas in glass homes throwin' the most stones
My brothers get them loads and flip 'em like old phones
Got the cream on the ice, I'm rockin' some cold stones
My city is stone cold, from the snow a rose rose
Right up out the concrete, a nigga grew
All I ever did was tell the fuckin' truth
They say that rap is dead and I'm the living proof
I killed the game, it's nothin' left for me to do
Fuck the love, my nigga, I need the loot
I'm tryna trade that old Corolla for a coupe
My nigga said fuck the law, fuck school
Whippin' soda on the side, ain't no chicken noodle soup, ayy
Yeah, need it up front, fuck a backend
Used to be my nigga, that was back then
If you book me for a show, you know it's packed in
Treat the club like the Apple Store and bring the MAC in, ayy
You know it ain't nothin' to it but to do it, ayy
I heard they gave your ass a shot and then you blew it, ayy
I don't love money, I just love what I can do with it, ayy
My old ho left me, I got richer, shit, I'm cool with it, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm really fallin' in love with all this money, you know I'ma pick that shit over you
I just started fuckin' up my money, that's just somethin' that was too overdue, yeah
Never gave a fuck, I'm still a youngin, you know I'ma do what I wanna do
It's no turnin' back, my heart turnin' black, my hundreds are blue

[Outro]
I been down bad so long, it was drivin' me crazy
My brother tryna rob, no job, ridin' with a 380, yeah
Gotta get my check up like a nurse, I ain't tryna be patient, no
This is an emergency, you know that I ain't 'bout to keep waitin'
