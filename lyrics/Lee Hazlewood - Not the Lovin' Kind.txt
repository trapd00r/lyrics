Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
So you better get it off your mind
Give you money I don't care take you with me anywhere
Oh tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind

Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
It's somebody else for you to find
Cast your tears into the sea don't waste your good tears on me
Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
(Strings - horns)
Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
So you better move on down the line
Told you so never lied love's a train I'll never ride
Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
I told you so never lied love's a train I'll never ride
Tell you babe I'm not the lovin' kind
Not the lovin' kind not the lovin' kind
