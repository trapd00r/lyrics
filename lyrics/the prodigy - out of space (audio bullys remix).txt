Send them... out... to space

I'm gonna send him to outta space
To find anotha race
I'm gonna send him to outta space
To find anotha race

I'm gonna put off my polo shirt
And chase the haters out of earth

Send them... out... to space

Send them... out... to space

Send him to outta space
Send him to outta space
To find anotha race

I'll take your brain to another dimension
Step in the room, feel the tension
Cash flows, too much to mention

I'll take your brain to another dimension
Step in the room, feel the tension
Cash flows, too much to mention
Take your brain to another dimension

Thunder race, too much you can't stop it
Light a fuse, well yeah I'm gonna rock it
Back in the club with the stuff in my pocket
Man's got a case, yeah I'm gonna knock it
Girls get down so kids can make profit
Some like business, others get off it
Who the fuck is this?
The Audio Prophet
What?
The Audio Prophet!

I'll take your brain to another dimension
Step in the room, feel the tension
Cash flows, too much to mention

I'll take your brain to another dimension
Step in the room, feel the tension
Cash flows, too much to mention
Take your brain to another dimension

Send him to outta space
To find anotha race

Send him... out

I'm gonna send him to outta space
To find anotha race

I'm gonna send him to outta space
To find anotha race

I'm gonna send him to outta space
