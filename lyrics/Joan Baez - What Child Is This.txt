What Child is this who laid to rest
On Maryâ€™s lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

The old year now is fled away
The new year it is entered
Then let us now our sins down tread
And joyfully all appear
Let's merry be this day
And let us now good sport and play
Hang grief, cast care away
God send you a happy new year!
