See the devil on the doorstep now (my oh my)
Telling everybody oh just how to live their lives
Sliding down the information highway
Buying in just like a bunch of fools
Time is ticking and we can't go back (my oh my)

What about the world today
What about the place that we call home
We've never been so many
and we've never been so alone

You keep watching from your picket fence
You keep talking but it makes no sense
You say we're not responsible 
but we are, we are
You wash your hands and come out clean
Fail to recognise the enemies within
You say we're not responsible
but we are, we are, we are, we are

One step forward making two steps back (my oh my)
Riding piggy on the bad boys back for life
Lining up for the grand illusion
No answers for no questions asked
Lining up for the execution
Without knowing why

You keep watching from your picket fence
You keep talking but it makes no sense
You say we're not responsible 
but we are, we are
You wash your hands and come out clean
Fail to recognise to enemies within
You say we're not responsible
but we are, we are, we are, we are

Its all about power then
Take control
Breaking the rule
Breaking the soul
They suck us dry till theres nothing left
my oh my, my oh my
