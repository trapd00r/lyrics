Is there an earthquake causing the earth to shake
So violently that I can't stand on my two feet
(Why can't I stand on my two feet?)
It makes my heart break knowing I'm not
What I thought I'd be
I always hoped for greater things
(I know I'm meant for greater things)
But not now

Tear down these walls
I'd climb but I can't stand to fall without You
Tear down these walls that separate us now
I can't make them fall without You

I spent a long time building barricades to fortify
Creating space by drawing lines (by drawing lines)
But now I realize when I try to hide it's all in vain
I end up pushing You away
(I'm tired of pushing You away)
But not now

You'll find me lying down in the debris waiting for You
There's not much left of me
But what is left is willing
God I'm willing
