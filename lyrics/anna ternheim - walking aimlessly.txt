In the black out of light
I found a rhyme on hope
In the corner of doubt
Someone left a word hanging on to me still
A comfort I say
The making of a slow day

I draw a pair of new eyes in my mind
Reaching out who knows what I could find

Walking aimlessly
Walking aimlessly
Walking aimlessly

In blue hours of dawn
Before the day rushes on
And confusion grabs hold
Have the thoughts come and let go

I draw a pair of new eyes in my mind
Reaching out who knows what I could find
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Walking aimlessly
Walking aimlessly
Walking aimlessly

In the black out of light
I found a rhyme on hope
In the corner of doubt
Someone left a word hanging on to me still

Walking aimlessly
Walking aimlessly
Walking aimlessly
