Music is what i'm living for

Everybody loves to dance
With another summer romance uh baby
Everybody likes to move
All the fellows having the groove uh baby

Everybody move your feet
To the rythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

Music is what I'm living for
Hit the dancefloor like there ain't no more
Ain't no more time for taking your chance
Jam digin jam to the summer romance
wave your hands in the air
Everyone and everywhere...
Move your body jump around check it out with this sound
Everybody,everybody..get up and sing it loud
This is the sound that makes you feel proud

Everybody here tonight
We will never start a fight uh baby
Everybody is feeling proud
If you feel it say it loud uh baby

Everybody move your feet
To the rythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

When the sun goes down
And the night moves up
The time is right to enjoy yourself
And doin' whatever you wanna do
I mean everybody

Pleasure and pain sometimes the same
I'm not the shamed there's no name for the game
The game that makes my heart still pumping
Boom boom, my body is jumping 
Love everyday and night
the sigh for peace is shining bright
Everybody everybody, get up and sing it loud
This is the song that makes you feel proud

Everybody move your feet
tho the rythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
all the people having fun 
(repeat til it fades...)
