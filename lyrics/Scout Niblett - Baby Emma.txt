Do what you will supposed outsiders of my soul
But don't be so sure just cause you get lonely
That you're not me, that you're not me, that you're not me, that you're not me
And I am not you, and I'm not you

All of my allies and enemies
Played out, played out eternally
For ourselves, for ourselves, for ourselves, for ourselves,
For our amusement, for our amusement

And you don't say, and you don't say, and you don't say, and you don't say
No you don't say, no you don't say

Let's pulse and let's crackle eternally
Amplify our sorrow for each other to see
To remember, to remember, to remember, to remember
To remember, to remember

Baby Emma, do what you will
Are they just saying that you don't even know
I don't think so, I don't think so, I don't think so, I don't think so
I don't think so, I don't think so

And you don't say, and you don't say, and you don't say, and you don't say
No you don't say, no you don't say
