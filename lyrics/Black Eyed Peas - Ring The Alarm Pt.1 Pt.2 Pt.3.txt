Pt. 1

Wake up!

I wanna say what's on my motherfuckin' conscious
The whole world right now is fucking bonkers
The internet is the brand new conqueror
So watch out for the motherfuckin' monsters (yikes)
The trolls are the taunters, whoever controls the data got the answers
They the ones that got the code to the launcher
And they be having dinner with the Pope and the mobsters
They know the cure for the cancer
Cure for the AIDS and they prolly killed the Panthers
Put us in a cage got us living like hamsters
Put us in the dark but I got me a lantern
Open up my third eye, then I illuminate
Willy got a bird eye view when I elevate
No Illuminati, baby, I'm god body
The rapture like Blondie wakin' up zombies
Wake up!

Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Wake up!

A wise man said knowledge is king
Know thyself and you can do anything
Know thyself and you could shine like bling
Know thyself and you're the king of the ring, ha
But they don't teach kids nothing
All they know is iPad, sugar in their muffin
They don't know division, don't add to nothing
Send them off to prison when you know they did nothing
He in the streets 'cause he always cuttin'
The teacher ain't teaching him nothin'
All they do was stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em and stuffin' 'em
Stuffin' 'em with stuff he can't use
So he sell crack, that's what he know to do
His daddy was a hustler, so he hustle too
And that's why you see the lil' killer in the news
It's kinda like they got us in a trap
It's kinda like they knowin' how we act
I'll be like "fuck your fuckin' laboratory, I am not a rat"
I am light, I am God body, wise to the fact
Wake up!

Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Wake up!

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Pt. 2

Wake up!
Wake up!

Eyes open, who's watching the watchers?
Clock ticking like we're running out of options
Villains in the White House, heroes in their coffins
Leaders double cross while we kneeling to our crosses
Whose policing the police, why they stalking?
All lives matter till your color is the target
Fox running up the sheep for the slaughter
Money over people while they reaching for that dollar
All I see's lies on the screen
Land of the free, but what the fuck's free?
What does it cost to let a nigga breathe?
King had a dream but we all still asleep, huh
They robbed you blind and knowledge is a crime
The shit's designed to keep you on a grind
Rise and shine, cause now it's the time
We all God body if you open up your mind
Wake up!

Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Tell the people here come the storm
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Revolution time has come
Wake up, wake up, sound the alarm
Ring the alarm, ring the alarm

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Pt. 3

Ain't nothing impossible, I tell myself
That I am possible
I know that devil is out there and plotting those plans
To stop me and put me in hospital bed
I said "Yo, I would not be toppled, I'm down with Jesus and I roll with apostles"
We got that big love, that love that's colossal
We meditate ain't no need to get hostile
You cannot penetrate me with the hate
We got that good vibration on vibrate
Stay on that way up 'cause we elevate
We got that big love, the love heavyweight
Wait, wait, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Ha, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
I tell them, yo
The movement's unstoppable
Pausing the flow, that is not optional
I let 'em know, everything's solvable
When you know science, everything is plausible
I am defiant, I'm also logical
Politicians be tripping, they comical
So I sit back and listen to audio
Spiritual hip-hop, I call that hypnoticals
We Budda-Boy, B-Boy phenomenals
We Zulu-kill zombies in chronicles
We ain't falling 'cause we ain't dominoes

That revolution is on go
Go, go, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
Yup, that's the gospel
That's the motherfucking gospel
