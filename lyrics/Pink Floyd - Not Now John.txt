David Gilmour:
Fuck all that, we've got to get on with these
(Fuck all that, fuck all that)
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese

There's too many home fires burning and not enough trees
(Fuck all that)
So fuck all that, we've got to get on with these
(Gotta get on with these)

Roger Waters:
Can't stop, lose job,
Mind gone, silicon.
Stroll on, what bomb?
Get away, pay day!
Make hay, break down
Need fix, Big Six,
clickety click, hold on, oh no!
Bingo!
(Bingo!)

Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry
Make 'em dance in the aisles
Make 'em pay, make 'em stay
Make 'em feel OK 

David Gilmour:
Not now John, we've got to get on with the film show
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
(End of the rainbow)
Who cares what it's about as long as the kids go?
(As long as the kids go)
So not now John, we've got to get on with the show
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)

(Gotta get on, gotta get on, gotta get on)

Hang on John, I've got to get on with this
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Don't know what it is but it fits on here like... ssssssssssssss
Come at the end of the shift, we'll go and get pissed
Not now John, I've got to get on with this
(Gotta get on with this, gotta get on)

Roger Waters:
Hold on John, I think there's something good on
I used to read books but...
Could be the news or some other abuse
Or it could be reusable shows

Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear, maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina, now let's go and show these
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Make us feel tough and wouldn't Maggie be pleased?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah!
Whoo!
One, two, three, four!
(Not now John, we gotta get on)
S'cusi dove il bar
"What?"
(Gotta get on)
Se para collo pou eine toe bar
(Not now John, we gotta get on)
S'il vous plait ou est le bar
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Say it in English!
Oi, where's the fucking bar John?
Oh, now you're talking!
(Not now John, we gotta get on)
Whoo!
Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the waves
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Down!
(Not now John, we gotta get on)
Go, Maggie!
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now!
(Not now John, we gotta get on)
