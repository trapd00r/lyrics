I ate it, I hate it
They see me dancing there alone
It called my name, take me under, you dirty sour thing

You infect me
The insects feed on the sane

Psychoactive on a mystical wave
I found some clarity in this three-dimensional space

Brick patterns, blue shadows
Filled with light they swim away
I'm feeding on millions, burning in his skin
It's burning into him

You infect me
The insects feed on the sane

Psychoactive on a mystical wave
I found some clarity in this three-dimensional space

Ghost! My shadow! Caress me under bed!
Ghost! My shadow! Caress me under bed!
