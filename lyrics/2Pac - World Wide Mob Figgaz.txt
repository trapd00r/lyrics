Wild ridahs all I see when I open up
Baby girl fucking you now, before I blow up
You know what?

In the closet like a ridah type of whore by the shore
Not sure, of who to trick on but I'm collectin these vicks when I put the dick on her
O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
Fucking with a nigga living destructively, pump and pee Tuckin T's up in?
When I jump on I'm trying to handle my business full grown
Just soft niggaz, it's getting crazy after dark, where the real thug niggaz see ya are?

(Young Noble)

(Napoleon)
Nigga duck down buck first, make 'em feel somethin'
Shouldn't (?) if you ain't kill nuttin
You didn't kill me now you gotta face a young man got chrome heavily armed
Outlawz did that, heavily gone
So we ride with what's left us, the best of us
Plus we wake up with our tech on us
We test yo' nuts in a heartbeat, sleep on the street
Obey the rules of the ones who want beef we'll eat
Y'all niggaz weak in a motherfuckin way it's so pitiful
I'll leave you mother fuckers critical
We heard the slick shit you said on fucking Too $hort tape
But you only stepped your way into an early wake, early grave
That's what you brave niggaz get for fucking with this
You had your chance to mob first you didn't you missed
Just switched to fake
Napoleon be the mother fucker last nigga with the gat to break
The last of fate, earthquake aftershock, is what you got
Fuckin' with niggaz that give a damn about hip-hop
This how it go in our family
Busting outlawz shit is what we stand for gradually
We world wide mob figgaz

(Tupac Talking)
World wide mother fucking mob figgaz
Weed smoking, Gun toting, drinking
Riding on our mother fucking enemies
Y'all know how we do it
A world wide mob figure

(Young Noble)
I be the Young N-O to the B-L-E
Last name O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
M-A-R was for starters, flee the whole cartridge
Your lady blew out the squad and the whold sausage
(?), Hitting donuts in a six
Sip Coronas when we bendin the corner, brothers hit
Urban legend, dirty third still reppin
Still double-S to bum rush your session
I get as dirty as birt, you just a nigga in a skirt
Drinkin' Squirt, punk duck, hit the dirt
Sprint to the church that you got comin'
Outlawz on the ride picture God runnin'
Ain't nuttin but a thug thang, bust your brains
Pac passed the rock so we tucked the game
Under our belt, we huntin the wealth, you fuckin' yourself off
Don't you know not to go against the Outlawz


World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang...
World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang...

(Verse Four: 2Pac)
Hey watch out man, look out
Known for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin me
And nah it ain't the drugs it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery, is automatic lettin niggaz have it
I've been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks
Ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a catch a nigga world wide
A fuckin' mob figga West coast, who-ride
When we rob niggaz money make my squad bigger
But we ain't sell our souls
Bustin' on my enemies, murder my foes
At my shows I'm a nut, lights camera time for action
Now get to clappin to my cuts, a world wide mob figga
