When sun is setting down 
And city lights awake 
The moon's rising high 
And my eyes are borderline 

I live from dusk 'till dawn 
When the night conquers light 
I live from dusk 'till dawn 
When the night conquers light 

Remember lots of screams 
An ugly dapple-face 
Vampires were insistent 
I've hustled far and wide 
Cautiously persistent 
I've freaked out in their spite 
Like a nightmare all in trance 
I always lie unfurl 
My darkness gives the chance 
To forget that outside world 

I live from dusk 'till dawn 
When the night conquers light 
I live from dusk 'till dawn 
When the night conquers light 

Spooky fog in dreary streets 
Hides the secrets in the dark 
Eerie winds and noises sound like music to my ears 
A nasty giggle, a sadistic grind are sounds that I've heard before 
All this flare of glooming 
When the night conquers light 

I live from dusk 'till dawn 
When the night conquers light 
I live from dusk 'till dawn 
When the night conquers light....
