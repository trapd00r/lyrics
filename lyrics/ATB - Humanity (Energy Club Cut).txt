(So helpless)

I've been swallowed by your kindness
Every part of me is breaking down
You have let me feel so helpless
As if I couldn't drown
It was only love
You understood the need in me
So much tenderness
You wrapped me in Humanity

You touched my soul
My very being
You made me whole
Now life has new meaning
Got a second chance
You can see the change in me
And as we dance
You wrap me in humanity

You touched my soul
My very being
You made me whole
Now life has new meaning
Got a second chance
You can see the change in me
And as we dance
You wrap me in humanity

Others walked on by in their blindness
But you refused to let me be
My disguise you saw behind this
You pushed on in and set me free
And it was in protection
You held on with such certainty
Embraced by your affection
As you wrapped me in humanity

You touched my soul
My very being
You made me whole
Now life has new meaning
Got a second chance
You can see the change in me
And as we dance
You wrap me in humanity
