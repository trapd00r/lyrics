Use your minds to sift through what is real
And what's being used to blind you bind your thoughts up
With the fear of time, and all that’s in between
From the screens to the scenes to the actors in the GOP

Working and driving, talking and smiling
If you're not happy we've got drugs to subside it
Get you back in the game, get you looking the same
As the best of the rest of them, so you can proclaim
That we’re all alive tonight
Yea we're all alright tonight

Time will pass, and the end of what we know will arrive at last
In a splash of fire, bombs and crying
Families torn apart
Just when the robots take control
Of everything you've ever known

And in the dark of the future
When the sun lies down for good
We will find that life can suspend itself in the circuitry of a tube

As the human dies below us, we will take another form
And all the nonsense that we once counted on
Turns to dust with intelligence reborn
And we'll be singing louder now that
We're all alive tonight
Yeah we're all alright tonight!
