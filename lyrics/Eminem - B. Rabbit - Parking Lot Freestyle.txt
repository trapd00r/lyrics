Now everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up
Look, look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free world got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 Pac, 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, you're Pacs: none

This guy ain't no motherfucking MC,
I know everything he's got to say against me,
I am white, I am a fucking bum,
I do live in a trailer with my mom,
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl,
I'm still standing here screaming, "Fuck the free world!"
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through

But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook. That's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence

And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look
In his fucking yearbook,
Fuck Cranbrook

Fuck a beat, I go a capella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer,
fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outty,
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me.
