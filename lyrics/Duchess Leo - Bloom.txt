Hiding deep in my soul

I wanna be a producer
With a hit show on Broadway

Sport a top hat and a cane
I wanna be a producer
And drive those chorus girls insane! 
I wanna be a producer
And sleep until half-past two
I wanna be a producer
And say, "You, you, you, not you"

Wear a tux on op'ning nights!

And see my name "Leo Bloom" in lights!
