She's like a superstar
She's wearin' high heels and a space guitar
She's dancing like a roboton
And everybody's freakin' out

On and on
She's dancing all night long
She's dancing till the break of dawn
And everybody's on the supersonic motivated disco floor

Oh, oh, oh, a riot on the dancefloor
Oh, oh, oh, the crowd's outta control
Oh, oh, oh, the DJ's gotta lock up
Oh, oh, oh, people wanna rock the floor
People wanna rock the floor

She's sippin' gin and juice
Look how she works, she's got the crazy moves
Purple make up and freak tattoos
No one can ever slow her downn

On and on
She's dancing all night long
She's dancing till the break of dawn
And everybody's on the supersonic motivated disco floor

Oh, oh, oh, a riot on the dancefloor

Oh, oh, oh, the crowd's outta control
Oh, oh, oh, the DJ's gotta lock up
Oh, oh, oh, people wanna rock the floor
People wanna rock the floor

Oh, oh, oh, a riot on the dancefloor
Oh, oh, oh, the crowd's outta control
Oh, oh, oh, the DJ's gotta lock up
Oh, oh, oh, soldiers get your head up
