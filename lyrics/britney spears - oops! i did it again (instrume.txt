Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah

I think I did it again
I made you believe
We're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean 
That I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, baby

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes they truly exist
I cried watching the days
Could you see I'm a fool 
In so many ways?

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Baby, oh

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yeah

"All aboard"
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have."
"Oh, it's beautiful. 
But wait a minute, isn't this...?"
"Yeah, yes it is."
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end."
"Well, baby, I went down and got it for you."
"Aw, you shouldn't have."

Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh, baby
Oops!...you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
