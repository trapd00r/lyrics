Your flirts finds me out
Teases the crack in me
Smittens me with hope
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe, possibly maybe.

As much as I definitely enjoy solitude
I wouldn't mind perhaps
Spending little time with you
Sometimes, sometimes
Possibly maybe probably love,
Possibly maybe probably love

Uncertainty excites me
Baby
Who knows what's going to happen?
Lottery or car crash
Or you'll join a cult

Probably maybe, possibly love
Probably maybe, possibly love
possibly

Mon petit vulcan
You're eruptions and disasters
I keep calm
Admiring your lava
I keep calm

Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love

Electric shocks
I love them
With you dozen a day
But after a while I wonder
Where's that love you promised me?
Where is it?

Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love

How can you offer me love like that?
My heart's burned
How can you offer me love like that?
I'm exhausted
Leave me alone
Possibly maybe, 
possibly maybe, 
possibly maybe.

Since we broke up
I'm using lipstick again
I suck my tongue
In remembrance of you

Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
