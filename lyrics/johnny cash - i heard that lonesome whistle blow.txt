I was riding number nine, heading south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I got in trouble had to roam, I left my gal 'n left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
Just a kid acting smart I went and broke my darlings heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off that Georgia main locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All alone I bear the shame, I'm a number not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry, when that evenin' train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell, till my bodys just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine, I'm in Georgia doin' time
I herd that lonesome whistle blow
