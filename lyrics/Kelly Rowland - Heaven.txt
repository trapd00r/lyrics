I wanna love together
Kissin' and touchin' feels better
Now that I have, have you
I couldn't ask for nothing more

Like a misty breeze on a summer day
Or the warmth of sun after rain
You always seem to balance me with your love
If you're far away, I want you near
Might sound clich√©, but my words are so sincere
Can you taste the joy inside my tears?
I'm so in love

I have found love's treasure
In this ocean of pleasure
And now that I have, have you
I won't search for anything more

Ooh, love, what have you done to me?
This crazy feeling, I can't describe
It feels like love, it must be love
It must be love
Feels like snow caressing mountaintops
When I see your eyes from afar
All I can do is run with open arms
And love with all I got
I feel so at home
We're alone

Ooh, love
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love
You love so good

Baby, we'll grow together
This is a joint endeavour
And there's nothin' I'd rather see
Than the love in your eyes for me

'Cause this feeling is so surreal
You touch me places I didn't feel
I used to want, but now I will trust in love
I'm elated and overjoyed
Over this connection of girl and boy
I was empty till you filled the void
I'm so in love, ooh

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love
You love so good

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I...
