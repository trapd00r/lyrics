We all want to be the queen of your parade
We all want to be the queen of your parade
We all wanna be the queen of your freak show
We all wanna be the queen of your freak show
Ashes and cigarettes
Smell of your stale bouquet
Eating words and regrets
Looking at the road, looking at the road
I watch the plane take off
Thought it could be me
Hey Lord, I know you're up there
Send your smile across the sea
Golden soft like my cheek
Long ago, long ago
Oh, the way time is passing
Makes my mind slow
We all want to be the queen of your parade
We all want to be the queen of your parade
We all wanna be the queen of your freak show
We all wanna be the queen of your freak show
(We all want to see the way)
