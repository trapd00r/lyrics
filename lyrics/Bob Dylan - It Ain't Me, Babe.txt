Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need

You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak, but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong

Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down

You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart

Someone who will die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway, I'm not alone

You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call

A lover for your life and nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
