Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy (crazy)
Make him call me "mama" (mama)
Make him my new baby (baby)
A new way to prove they're saying "thank you very much" (ah)
Living legend
You can look, but don't touch

'Cause I'm (ooooh) cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm (ooooh) cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down

To see your foolishness and f**kery
I'm handling my business (business)
Holler if you hear me (hey)
Can I get a witness (mmm)
Preacher, preacher
I'm the teacher, you can learn (ah)
Watch your fingers, boy
You might get burned

'Cause I'm (ooooh) cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm (ooooh) cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down

As you can see (see)
Fortunately (ly)
I'm cold as fire (yeah, I'm cold as fire)
Yeah, make you believe (lieve)
Make you stop and breathe (breathe)
I'll take you higher
I'm just too cool (cool)
Make you do what it do (do)
I'm hot as ice now (yeah, I'm hot as ice now)
I'll make you feel like heaven (heaven) 24/7 (seven)
I'm hot as ice now, oh

(Ooooh) Cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm (ooooh) cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
