Some fifteen year old kid sits on his porch, just half-past noon
Trying to figure out just what he's doing, why he had to grow up so soon
With all the gangs, all the guns-watcha gonna learn in school
There's got to be some way out of here, he says "Man, this life is cruel"

I used to know this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life
She changed her name, her face, because the grass looked greener on the other side
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night
Her friends, her family feel the pain, but she's the one who cries

(Tell me what you want) Tell me what you want
(Tell me what you need) Tell me what you need
(I want everything) I want it all

I've had enough of havin' nothing
I won't take just anything
I got my mind set on something
All I want is everything
It's my life, mister, I ain't running
I'm no puppet on a string
I want more than I see coming
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

Say a prayer for Donnie, he died in his room just the other day
His brother come home, found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein
Cops come down with a body bag, they said Donnie was a casually 
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out, he couldn't handle reality 

(Tell me what you want) Tell me what you want
(Tell me what you need) Tell me what you need
(I want everything) I want it all

I've had enough of havin' nothing
I won't take just anything
I got my mind set on something
All I want is everything
It's my life, mister, I ain't running
I'm no puppet on a string
I want more than I see coming
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

I want it all

(Tell me what you want) Tell me what you want
(Tell me what you need) Won't you come and tell me what you neeed
(Tell me what you want) Tell me what you want

I've had enough of havin' nothing
I won't take just anything
I got my mind set on something
All I want is everything
It's my life, mister,  I ain't running
I'm no puppet on a string
I want more than I see coming
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want... I want it all
