Put a record on.
I wanna dance with my baby.

Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like my acid rock?

Hey Mr. DJ put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby.
And when the music starts I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy.
Music music music music music music music music music.

Music makes the people come together.
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel.

Think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie.
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it every day.

Music makes the people come together.
Music makes the bourgeoisie and rebel.
