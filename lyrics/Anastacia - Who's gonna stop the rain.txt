(Oh, oh, oh)
There is no rose without a thorn
No rain without the storm (Oh, oh, oh)
There is no laughter without tears
No wisdom without years (Oh, oh, oh)
In a world gone crazy
Torn between the roads
That we must choose
Win or lose
If every soul should lose it's way
If every face should lose it's name
Tell me who's gonna stop the rain?

(Oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh)

Each day another boy and girl
Sets foot into this world (Oh, oh, oh)
One reaches out to touch the sky
One never learns to fly (Oh, oh, oh)
Where is it written in the stone
That any child should walk alone
Out on their own?
If no one tries to end this game
Or find a way to ease the pain
Tell me who's gonna stop the rain? (Oh, oh, oh)
Who's gonna stop the rain?
I said, who's gonna stop the rain?
Hey, hey, yeah

How many rivers must we cross before we learn
That the flood is rising high
And the bridges all have burned
Each time another dream is washed into the sea
It's another piece of you
It's another piece of me
Oh yeah (Oh, oh, oh)

Sure as the blood runs through your veins
Sure as the falling rain, oh yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
We'll taste the tears of each defeat
The bitter and the sweet, yeah, oh yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
As the days grow colder
Wonder if we'll ever see the sun
When winter comes, yeah
If no one stands to take the weight
If no one answers to the blame
Tell me who's gonna stop the rain?

(Oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh)

Who's gonna stop the rain?
If every soul should lose it's way
If every face should lose it's name
If no one tries to end this game
Or find a way to ease the pain
Who's gonna stop the rain? (Oh, oh, oh)
If no one stands to take the weight
If no one answers to the blame
Tell me who's gonna stop?
Who's gonna stop ... the rain?
(Oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh)
Who's gonna stop the rain?
