Take your time, hear 'em out, how they went to go
About to give it up and find yourself in time
Take your time, it's all about the circle up to circle out
What's in your mind, then take your time
Take your time, come about, draw your flag and hand it out
Then take a look and then hide it deep inside
Take your time, hear 'em out, it works if you work it out
To clean out your mind and take your time

Take your time, hear 'em out, how they went to go
About to give it up and find yourself in time
Take your time, it's all about the circle up to circle out
What's in your mind, then take your time
Take your time, come about, draw your flag and hand it out
Then take a look and then hide it deep inside
Take your time, hear 'em out, it works if you work it out
To clean out your mind and take your time
