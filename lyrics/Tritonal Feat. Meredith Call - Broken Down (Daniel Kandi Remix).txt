Darling, you see now
That it never was
We are never what we see
Set you up to
Let you down, I'm afraid

Darling, do you see how
Our lies become the truth
We never said what we mean
Built you up to
Break you down, I'm afraid
I'm afraid

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love

Darling, it feels good
When they let you in
Don't you play the fool
They will only
Let you down if you stay
We can't all be broken down, I'm afraid
I'm afraid

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love (to the ones we love)
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love (to the ones we love)
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt
