Daddy was a soldier,
He taught me about freedom,
Peace and all the great things,
That we can take advantage of.

Once I fed the homeless
I'll never forget
The look upon their faces as I
Treated them with respect

CHORUS
This is my Vietnam
I'm at war
Life keeps on dropping bombs
And I keep score

Mama was a lunatic 
She liked to push my buttons
She said I wasn't good enough
But I guess I wasn't trying

Never liked school that much
They tried to teach me better
But I just wasn't hearing it
Because I thought I was already pretty clever

Repeat CHORUS (x 2)

What do you expect from me
What am I not giving you
What could I do for you
To make me okay in your eyes

Chorus: This is my vietnam
I'm at war
They keep on droppin bombs
And i keep score
