You used to say that I was special
everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much makeup
that my dress is too tight
Ya got no reasons to be jealous,
I've never been untrue
So why does it really matter if they're lookin?
I'm only looking at you
You should never try to change me
I cant be nobody else and I like the way I am

Chorus:
What U see, is what U get
This is me hey you
If you want me don't forget
You should take me as I am
Cuz I can promise you
Baby what U see is what U get

I know you watch me when I'm dancing
when I party with my friends
I can feel your eyes on my back, baby  no no
I can't have no chains around me
Baby can't you see?
I can be anything you dream of,
but I gotta feel free

You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else
and I like the way I am

Chorus

You should never try to change me
I can be nobody else

Believe me, you'll be lookin for trouble
if you hurt me, I can promise you
You'll be lookin for trouble
Believe me yeah yeah yeah yeah 

Chorus
cuz i can promise you
baby what you see is what you get!
