Jay-Z:
Uh-huh uh-huh (Yeah Rihanna)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Good girl gone bad)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Take 3... Action)
Uh-huh uh-huh

No clouds in my storms
Let it rain 
I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone
We Rockefeller
She fly higher than weather
And she rocks it better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation
stacks chips for the rainy day
Jay, rain man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?

Rihanna:
You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart 
Maybe in magazines 
But you'll still be my star 

Baby 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars 
And that's when you need me there 
With you I'll always share 
Because...

When the sun shines, we'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'm a stick it out 'till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Told you we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You are my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took it's part
When the world has dealt it's cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because...

When the sun shines, we'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'm a stick it out 'till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Told you we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh 
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh

You can run into my arms 
That's okay don't be alarmed 
Come here to me
There's no distance in between our love

So go on and let the rain pour 
I'll be all you need and more
Because...

When the sun shines, we'll shine together 
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'm a stick it out 'till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Told you we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella 
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh

It's rainin' rainin'
Ooh baby it's rainin' rainin'
Baby come here to me 
Come here to me 

It's rainin' rainin'
Ooh baby it's rainin' raining
Baby come here to me
Come here to me
