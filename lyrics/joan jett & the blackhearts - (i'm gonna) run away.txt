(Joan Jett/Kenny Laguna)

I can't take it 
This is gettin' silly 
Can't find me no tranquility 
Anymore, I just can't get through to You 

We're fakin' it, it's time to admit it 
You make me feel like an idiot 
All the time, there's nothin' left for me to do 
No, so 

I'm gonna run away 
I'm never comin' back to you 
Yeah yeah, I'm gonna run away 
I'm never comin' back to you 

We were friends but now you're the enemy 
Don't need this when there's a remedy 
It's the end 
Play your trick on someone new 

I'm gonna run away 
I'm never comin' back to you 
Yeah yeah, I'm gonna run away 
I'm never comin' back to you 

Ain't life strange, how people change 
You were all I wanted once 
Now you're just a pain, pain 

I'm gonna run away 
I'm never comin' back to you 
Yeah yeah, I'm gonna run away 
I'm never comin' back to you
