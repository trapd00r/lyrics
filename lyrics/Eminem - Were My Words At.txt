[Chorus x 2]
My words are weapons 
(I use em to crush my opponents) 
My words are weapons 
(Never show no emotion) 
My words are weapons 
(I use em to kill whoever steppin to me) 
My words are like weaponry on a record 

[Eminem]
The rage I release on a page is like a demon unleashed in a cage 
Lunatic, Soon as I hit the stage 
My mind is like a fuckin stick of dynamite 
Once I get behind tha mic its like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight 
My nine is like a guiding light at night shinin' bright 
My fuckin grip is tighter then my wife's vagina SIKE 
These cocksuckin **cops** 
Got my Smith and Wesson 
I guess its time to pick a different weapon man that shits depressin 
But Swift is gettin me a new one for a Christmas present 
[Swift] - Come on Slim lets go teach this fuckin bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish 
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage 
Shady stay creative baby hold your head up don't u let up 
One bit on these motherfuckin suckers you a soldier get up 
Stand up for what you believe in as long as u breathin 
They jealous of you man that's the only reason they beefin' 

[Chorus x 2]

[Swift]
Its that Dirty Dozen renegade 
You done pulled the pin on my grenade 
38's will move your shit up out the way 
You niggas wont forget about McVay 
You got sumtin to say let it out today 
And watch these bullets spray 
From these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters 
That will make Jeff Dahmers look like he caught a misdemeanor 
See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta to buy pistol cleaner 
An official beater don't let me see you with your heater 
You get swift with it 
Tell that mutherfucker Swift did it 
You packing sumtin special in your crib then bitch get it 
I'm physically fitted to run your digits 
I'm hostile with this **Rosco** pointed up your nostrils 
You get splitted and guess what I'm blowin up the hospital 
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a ho 
I'm hannibal lector the spinal cord disconnector findin whores 
to lockup in motels and inject em 

[Chorus x 2]

[Bizarre]
I'm eating crews like I'm Hannibal 
There's no way I could be the gay rapper 
(Em - Why Not?) 
I only fuck animals 
Stupid Trick got my dick starting to itch 
Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch 
One on one in this blood sport 
I'm in divorce court 
Suin' my bitch off a pack of Newports 
6 times I've been arrested 
How would you feel if you let your ho witness that always got molested 
I'm smokin dank drinkin drink 
I cant have any kids cuz I'm fuckin shooting blanks 
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck 
Nicole's a whore and I'm glad O.J murdered his slut 
Responsibility I'm negligent 
Bill Clintons a fag should be stabbed 
Let Richard Simmons be the president 
Call me a weirdo 
Call me bazeer 
While I stick up your ass till while you shit diarrhea
