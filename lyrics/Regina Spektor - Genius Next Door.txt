Some said the local lake had been enchanted,
Others said it must have been the weather.
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet,
But I swear that I could hear the laughter.
So they jokingly nicknamed it the porridge,
'Cause overnight that lake had turned as thick as butter.
But the local kids would still go swimming,
Drinking, saying that to them it doesn't matter.

If you just hold in your breath,
'Til you come back up in full.
Hold in your breath,
'Til you thought it through,
You fool.

The genius next door was bussing tables,
Wiping clean the ketchup bottle labels.
Getting high and mumbling German fables.
Didn't care as long as he was able,
To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters,
At night while everyone was sleeping,
And wade midway into that porridge,
Just him and the secret he was keeping.

If you just hold in your breath,
'Til you come back up in full.
Hold in your breath,
'Til you thought it through,
You foolish child.

In the morning, the film crews start arriving,
With doughnuts, coffee, and reporters.
The kids were waking up hung over,
The neighbors were starting up their cars.
The garbage men were emptying the dumpsters,
Atheists were praying full of sarcasm,
And the genius next door was sleeping.
Dreaming that the antidote is orgasm.

If you just hold in your breath,
'Til you come back up in full.
Hold in your breath,
'Til you thought it through,
You foolish child.
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
