Springtime in Paris it was late in the night
And, I was looking round at all the usual sights
Suddenly there right in front of my eyes
I saw this girl and I sighed je t'aime

Felt my passion rising as I watched her go by
I speak a little francais so I gave it a try
I was confused - she'd put my mind in a haze
Then I remembered a phrase - je t'aime

Stay with me - mon chérie
Maybe then
You'll say je t'aime
Stay with me - please say oui
To a rendez-vous
Je t'aime - means I love you

Parlez-vous anglais didn't bring no success
And she won't say her name or even write her address
Don't wanna lose her in the Champs Elysées
Only one thing I can say - je t'aime

Mademoiselle has got to me like no one before
And I just wanna love her
And then love her some more
Wish that I'd learnt - my lessons better at school
I'm standing here like a fool - je t'aime
