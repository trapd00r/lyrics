Sure would like to see you
And visit your big house in the sky
I wish you didn't have to leave us
But since you're gone the time sure does fly

So I don't get too attached too much anymore
It's a different world and I'm a different girl

All the rain and all the pain
I hope it's for the good
'Cause I know I'll never be the same
These are things that made me change
I hope it's for the good
'Cause I know I'll never be the same

So proud to have your baby
Till you up and left us alone
Would you care that it drove me crazy?
I have to make it on my own

So I don't get too attached too much anymore
It's a different world and I'm a different girl

All the rain and all the pain
I hope it's for the good
'Cause I know I'll never be the same
These are things that made me change
I hope it's for the good
'Cause I know I'll never be the same

Pray the lord my soul to keep
I try to hang on to the best of me
But changes keep on changing me
I just want to love who I turn out to be

All the rain...
Don't quite understand it
Can't quite handle it
