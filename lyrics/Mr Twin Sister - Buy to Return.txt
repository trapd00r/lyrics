Buy to return
Buy to return
Every week
It gives you something to do
Something to prove
No one knows where you are, when you drive
Strapped in

Staring at a red light
Don't you know what's next to buy next week?

Line after line, never needed reasons
Line after line, any time of day
Next is your turn
No need for policy signs
You got them all memorized, you say
Hi Ruth, you have to help me
You never saw me here
Is it ever happening to you, when you're

Staring at a red light
Don't you know what's next to buy next week?

What is all this white sugar
Torture in the whites of your eyes
Something to quit, or to take up
To change, or just leave behind

Staring at a red light
Staring at a red light
Don't you know what's next to buy next?

One last time
Nothing fits right
Dead on line
Ruth I need a change, need another size
