[Nate Dogg - chorus] 
I need a light (light) 
so I can smoke away this pain 
I need a drink (drink) 
so I can drink away this rain 
maybe a wife (wife) 
somebody to share my name 
I need a song 
a brand new song to sing 

[Warren G] 
Long Beach back in the day was all hustling 
young niggaz in the neigborhood struggling 
praying to god we ammount to something 
by living on the street where they constantly busting 
big Warren told us that they can't hold us 
Niggaz ain't shit 'till they pass away 
so I, watched my step 
but when Ola Mae left I was a mothafucking basket case 
for real 
god bless me 
cuz I be on the east where they wanna arrest me 
I break bread so they wanna suspect me 
but look me in my eyes and say they wanna protect me 
yeah 
ruthless, my style as a juvenile 
ran with a gang, got me a profile 
as a child in the Beach I was wild 
ready to die and that's why.. 

[Nate Dogg - chorus] 

[Warren G] 
could it be it was all so simple 
dropping a slick instrumental 
Snoop busting 'bout the shit we went through 
Nate singing 'bout the city we came from 
and niggaz so tight wasn't nothing we wouldn't do 
time keep slipping 
but I ain't tripping nigga it's all about my children 
so you can save that bullshit 
cuz if I pull my shit, nigga I'ma kill you 
the streets is watching 
and niggaz fell victim from L.A. to Watts and Compton 
but life goes on 
it's just another song if you ain't to one gone 
listen 
ruthless, my style as a juvenile 
but now I got a brand new G-Child 
big Warren gotta stay trunk tight 
cuz he got the fly and that's why.. 

[Nate Dogg - chorus] 

[Warren G] 
listen 
caviar wishes, twisting stitches, all out race for the riches 
got a nigga missing what rich is 
and what a life mean if you do it for the kids 
it's for my family y'all 
really the only one who understand me y'all 
cuz it ain't hard to ball 
but then who got ya back when it's time to fall 
and it's amazing 
to stay up on top, your game so close to the pavement 
time brings change in mind 
but then don't let the change bring your mind no time 
clearly, a conspiracy 
Niggaz right near me but still ain't hearing me 
that's how it's always gone fly 
'till you ready to die and that's why.. 

[Nate Dogg - chorus]
