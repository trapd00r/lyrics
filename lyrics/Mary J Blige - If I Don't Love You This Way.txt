If I don't love you this way
If I don't love you this way
If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say
If I don't need you this much
Why do I ache for your touch

With you it seems I could reach the stars
With reckless hopes and dreams
With you it seems I still don't believe
How valuable you are
I'm really loving you
Not pretending to
If I don't need you this strong
Why do I beg to belong
How can you doubt that I care
When I'm with you everywhere

With you I find I can close my eyes
To the world surrounding me
And you create the sweetest place
That I could ever be
I'm really loving you
Not pretending to

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say
If I don't need you this much
Why do I ache for your touch

You just have the smile
That makes my life worth while
That explains everything you gain

If I don't love you this way
Why do I say what I say
If I don't need you this much
Why do I ache for your touch
