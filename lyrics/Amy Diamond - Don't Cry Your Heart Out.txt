(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)
(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)
(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)

When she talks to you 
You never care to listen
When she walks with you 
Your eyes are always drifting
When you don't call her back 
Though you promised her that
What's that got to say about you?

When she calls for help
You rather call her helpless
She is there for you 
Why are you so selfish?
When you lie to her face 
With a smile on your face
What's that got to say about you?

So don't cry your heart out 
When she's nothing but a memory
Your heart out 
Cause your tears ain't worth a penny
Oh, my brother, brother
You will soon discover
What it's like to have the blues
And no one cries for you

(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)
(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)

So tell me who are you 
To shame and mistreat her
Cause she's not a man
But you are not one either
And you need to be checked
If you think for a sec
That karma won't come back to haunt you

When she's had enough 
Begging will be useless
When she's all fed up 
It's too late for excuses
When she leaves you behind 
At the drop of a dime
Pretty words won't even matter, oh no

So don't cry your heart out 
When she's nothing but a memory
Your heart out 
Cause your tears ain't worth a penny
Oh, my brother, brother
You will soon discover
What it's like to have the blues
And no one cries for you

And no one cries for you
No one cries for you
No not for you

Then you'll see, then you'll know
That you reap what you sow 
So don't weep, no don't go 
Cry your heart out

You don't know what you got 
Til it's gone and you stop 
And you think, but do not
Cry your heart out

(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)
(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)
(Duh duh duh, duh duh duh)

So don't cry your heart out
Don't you cry your heart out
No no no
Oh, my brother, brother
You will soon discover
What it's like to have the blues
And no one cries for you
