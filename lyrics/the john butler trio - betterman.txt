So better man I am since I
Come into contact with you
And you taught so many things about myself
And you know this is true
But now we are apart and it's all my fault
'Cos you know I need to be alone
Don't know myself
So how can I share me with you girl or anyone

Don't want to be a thorn in your side
Good woman
Always be the one
To make you cry
Don't wanna be that guy
Good woman
'Cos you deserve everything
And I got nothing so leave me
And I'll go away better off I stay
Far from you, you, you, you, you
Because you are beautiful

Beautiful woman

Now typical man
I am because you think
I want my cake and eat it too
'Cos say I can't be in a relationship
But I still feel for you
'Cos you are the best woman
This old man has ever met
You taught me about my soul 
You shared with me your magic

Don't want to be a thorn in your side
Good woman
Always be the one
To make you cry
Don't wanna be that guy
Good woman
'Cos you deserve everything
And I got nothing so leave me
And I'll go away better off I stay
Far from you, you, you, you, you, you
Because you are beautiful

Better man I am since I
Come into contact with you
And you taught
So many things about myself
And you know this is true
But now we are apart and it's all my fault
'Cos you know I need to be alone
Don't know myself
So how can I share me with you girl
Or anyone
'Cause you are

Beautiful beautiful beautiful woman
Better man I am 'cos of you
