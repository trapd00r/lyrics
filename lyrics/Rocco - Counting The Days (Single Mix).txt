It’s a long life
a long life you have to live
for only a short time
exit will let you leave
are you dancing
dancing all alone
with asassins who stab you down

I know how to defend
when you are in my head
I know that a storm is growing
I know how hate everything
but soon or later
I will win

Won’t you take off
take off that plastic mouth
you scare us
to death and more than that
are you sharing
sharing the blood of your veins
to marry the world and its pain

We are climbing
on our faith
we are crying with
pink sour plastic mouth
we are climbing
we have to beat them
with p.s.p.m
