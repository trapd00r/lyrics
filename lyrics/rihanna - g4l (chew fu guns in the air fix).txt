I lick the gun when I'm done
'Cause I know that revenge is sweet, so sweet
This is a gang, ladies' thing
Baby bang, tell me what you need

Any motherfucker wanna disrespect?
Playing with fire gonna get you wet
How'd it feel down there on your knees?
I got this girl's like a soldier
Trip and it's going down, down, down

I'm ready to roll
Girl, I'm with you with it get you to get me
So come on let's go
Bitch, I'm with you, if you with it you with me

You know I'm down, I'm down for life
Load and reload it, let's go
Gangster for life
'Til the day that I die

I promise I'm standing by
'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangster for life

We driving by with them headlights off
We know where you stay
Know what you did, we don't play that shit
Nigga, we don't play, no

Everybody cried when you did your dirt
Acting like a bitch gonna get you hurt
Breaking lives down to the knees, oh
I got this girl's like a soldier
Trip and it's going down, down, down

I'm ready to roll
Girl, I'm with you with it get you to get me
So come on let's go
Bitch, I'm with you, if you with it you with me

You know I'm down, I'm down for life
Load and reload it, let's go
Gangster for life

'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangster for life

Girls, come on we ain't done yet
Got a lot to handle, we ain't took over the world
We're an army, better yet a navy
Better yet, crazy, guns in the air

Guns in the air, guns in the air
Can't hear this again when you come around here
We got our guns, got our guns
We got our guns, got our guns
We got our guns in the motherfucking air, oh
