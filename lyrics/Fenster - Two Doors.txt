I saw you in line when I checked in
And I thought that you smiled, but im uncertain
I know all of the lines, but they don't work for me
So I just turned away and let it be

There's only two doors in between us
I got a bucket and I'll get some ice
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel alright tonight
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel tonight

On the way to my room, I saw you in the hall
Our rooms were side by side in this huge hotel
I could hear through the wall you were watching what I was
So I picked up my guitar and I wrote this for us

There's only two doors in between us
I've got a bucket and I'll get some ice
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel alright tonight
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel tonight

There's only two doors in between us
I've got a bucket and I'll get some ice
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel alright tonight
We'll watch a movie and we'll feel tonight
