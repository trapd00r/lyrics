You stared at your feet today
I drove to you in April rains
Wished it was last Saturday
I still didn't know you

Your mouth is like broken glass
It's the only thing I'm looking at
Sharpless though my new found nest
Has walls made of windows

Your heart is high
Your heart is high

You're louder than the kitchen sink
I'm louder than the thoughts I think
Looking at the mess I made and staring at the counter

Your heart is high
