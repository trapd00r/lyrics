It's such a funny sensation to be
So happy that you want to die
Promises always were crazy to me
But never was I so surprised
Minutes are longer when we are apart
Your presence more than I can handle
It's come to the point where I wonder if I
Could ever be luckier when

Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
Were you as good, as good as we are
Do you remember
Did you love her the way you love me
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her that you carry
Under the surface

Lend me your ears, I would like to confess
I'm doubting that you can be real
By your side wearing a beautiful dress
I celebrate how good it feels
Say that you love me, say that it's true
I know that I want to believe you
But somehow silence speaks louder than words
I'm worried she's still on your mind

Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
Were you as good, as good as we are
Do you remember
Did you love her the way you love me
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her that you carry
Under the surface

I know that I'm selfish
I know that it's bad
I know, but it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad

Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
Were you as good, as good as we are
Do you remember
Did you love her the way you love me
Is there a chance that there might be
Traces of her that you carry
Under the surface
Under the surface
Under the surface
