I am an international farmer,
Cultivating my good sensimilla.
I am an international farmer,
Cultivating my good sensimilla.

My cultivation is away in the woodland,
And you should see my irie calli tree,
How they beautifully grow.

And when my sensimilla get ripe, 
You can smell the sweet fragrance.
And when I smoke it up man,
It gives me a good meditation,
It give me a good inspiration,
For I to sing my song to the nation.
