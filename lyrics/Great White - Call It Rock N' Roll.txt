Well there's something going down right here in the neighbourhood
Yeah there's something going down and you don't know if you really should
Don't you lose your head i'll make your heart feel good

Well there's trouble all around, trouble with the PTA
Tell me what are you going to do, taking all our highs away
It's enough to turn you around but, momma, not today

Well come on, little baby, let's call it rock and roll
Well come on, little baby, let's call it rock and roll
Going to get a good feeling right down to your soul

Now your papa's getting down, momma's saying you're no good
Baby, it's a shame it's never really understood
How a dose of rock and roll can make your heart feel good

Well come on, little baby, let's call it rock and roll
Well come on, little mother, let's call it rock and roll
Going to get a good feeling right down to your soul

Well come on, little baby, let's call it rock and roll
Well come on, little honey, let's call it rock and roll
Going to get a good feeling right down to your soul

I said, yeah, yeah, call it rock and roll
I said, yeah, yeah, call it rock and roll
Going to get a good feeling right down to your soul
Going to get a good feeling right down to your soul
Going to get a good feeling right down to your soul
