I've got to try it's not over yet 
No signals of life have you left
My heart is bleeding just for you 
Bleeds for only
And it hurts to know the truth

Are you looking for savior
Chasing a dream
Love turned to hate
Now I'm crossing the border
Sealing our fate
But I'm not afraid

Wohoho Sinéad, for the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it, I know
Wohoho Sinéad, it's the first time
Only you can set it free
Wohoho Sinéad, come break away with me

This second chance I know won't last
But's OK, got no regrets
And I, I feel the end near, I'm no fool
Getting closer
But I'm doing what I should

I've been drowning in sorrow
Chasing tomorrow, running away
Now you're crossing the borders
Sealing tomorrow but you're not afraid

Wohoho Sinéad, for the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it, I know
Wohoho Sinéad, it's the first time
Only you can set it free
Wohoho Sinéad, come break away with me

I've been drowning in sorrow
Chasing tomorrow, running away
Now you're crossing the borders
Sealing tomorrow but you're not afraid

Wohoho Sinéad, for the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it

Wohoho Sinéad, for the first time
Life is gonna turn around
I'm telling you, you will like it, I know. Wohoho!
Wohoho Sinéad, it's the first time
Only you can set it free
Wohoho Sinéad, come break away with me
