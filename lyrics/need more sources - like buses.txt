got an angel of woman with big blue eyes
Friends in the country, old neckties
Big cheeseburgers and good French fries
Could go fishing but the fish draw flies

Could go swimming if it aint too deep
I’d rather just sit here and rest my feet
I know I aint lazy cause I don’t like sleep
Might just be lazy to you

I want to live in the city have a telephone
Live in the country throw my dog a bone
Ride on space ship want to get lost
Mama still tell me about the Pentecost

Ride a bicycle but my ass gets sore
Sell the holy bibles, door to door
Used to be stupid but aint no more
Might just be stupid to you

I like to drink beer, hang out in bars
Don’t like busses, and I don’t like cars
Don’t like president, don’t like stars
Never had stitches, but I do got scars

Love to go to parties, I love my friends
Got no books, just got bookends
Thing I’m crazy, well that depends
It don’t seem that crazy to me

The story’s old as since 74
There’s always doing, here’s some more
Friend come over from the liquor
Jole he dance till his feet get sore

Love my woman and my woman loves me
Don’t go skiing cause I cant ski
That kinda thing, that didn’t bother me
So it should’t be bothering you

I got an angel of woman with big blue eyes
Friends in the country, old neckties
Big cheeseburgers and good French fries.
Could go fishing but the fish draw flies

Could go swimming if it aint too deep
I’d rather just sit here and cool my feet
I know I aint lazy cause I don’t like sleep
Might just be lazy to you

Might just be stupid to you
Don’t seem that crazy to me
Well it shouldn’t be a bothering you
