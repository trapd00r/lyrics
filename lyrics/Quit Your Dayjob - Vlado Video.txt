[Round 1: Bender]
This ain't no challenge to Fredo Algebra, what, y'all didn't remember?
He been taking heads to school, but shit I guess I musta skipped that semester
But I've been, taking notes since days ago, managed to stitch 'em together
So now, Algebra's getting chalked out, here come the physics professor
You fat-headed fuck, this here's your valediction
I'm 'bout my business like Saudi prisons, Fre' I'm out of ya' zone
You can't mimic the sound or counterfeit it with a thousand digit algorithm
Brainstorm till a lake form I'm taking Fredo out on that boat
I came down from Mount Olympus, y'all couldn't reach the base camp
You powder sniffing a pound a minute pal for thinking that the blades match
How you living? I'm just tryna tell 'em where my brain's at
Brace your back, I break a bat in half without a Bane mask
I heard you beast in cyphers, sharper off the top than a Peaky Blinder
But I think they going overboard with the gas like a deep-sea diver
Plus your girl said when you be inside her, it's like a mosquito biting
So if I get her wet she'll give me a little head like the Zika virus
Get it through that watermelon, I was brought here to sacrifice it
You gon' feel this pain a lifetime long like a crash survivor
Or like your poor mother, from when that noggin was trapped inside her
And she opted for natural childbirth without rhinoceros tranquilizers
I mean shit, you my favorite opponent
I loved you in Bonk's Adventure, I'ma savor this moment
Big boned-ed bitch looking like Raven-Samoan
Fuck taking that dome for the trophy case I may just go bowling
I'm a 80-storey heartless salivating force of darkness
You a baby born to pray upon I, came to organ harvest
You basic, boring, harmless, what y'all pay him for? He garbage
Old Nintendo cartridge shit, you blew the game before it started
My shit's more beautifully imagined than you could even fathom after doing a sheet of acid on the moon with Peter Frampton
Put Fredo in the ring with me? Now you can see what happens
In a brutal reenactment of when Zeus released the Kraken
You ain't no rough rider son's lighter than Budweiser
Go the fuck home and eat gunfire like Budd Dwyer

[Round 1: Fredo]
I heard King Of The Dot's bringing me twot
Hold up, weren't you the ex-king of the Dot?
Didn't you lose that shit to Sketch Menace and ever since then you ain't done diddly-squat and you supposed to be the one giving the shot?
That's cool, my foundation brolic, I punch differently akh
This combination, solid, you get hit with a lock
Watch as I come forth with the gift of my thoughts
Rap grammar, bad Santa, they say I ain't got no presence, okay, I'm just gon' give him the box
Ain't no X-Men ever or the best Avenger could ever help you so you best surrender
In retrospect, you are unable to recollect the measure of the Fresh Coast veteran bringing death to all your predecessors
The fed detectives gon' have to Etch A Sketch ya'
â€¦
The fed detectives gon' have to Etch A Sketch ya'
And right when I start forgetting my bars, I'ma grab a electric guitar and fucking Fender Bender
You fucking with the monstrous Algebra
Spotted you with binoculars attached to rockets of plasma
[?] launch 'em at Ottawa, Canada
I'm chopping your harmless cadaver to pieces then feed you to a shark pit parameter
I'm a rider like Winona, I got caught with the game tucked in my armpit on camera
It's D Mighty, Fredito 3.0 grinding, rhyming, styling like I got PH and Caddy Ron standing besides me
I might be, the one to give your bitch a chair leg erection
If you dare aim a weapon, then it's your soul going up like, airplane ascension
This ain't no fair game, you stepping in a rare take with legend
This ain't no airplay of Zeppelin, but if you look, that hook'll send your stare, way to heaven
For you that's the highway to hell
My eyes red lit like the night train at 12
Try aim and fail, ice age and hail
Leave you a corpse, cold feet, do you ice skate as well?
I'm chiefing pot, till I'm wheezing ain't no need to talk
I'ma give Bender the Little Caesars pizza box
Meaning I do him greasy till his breathing stop
Faggot researched my battles last weekend and started beating off
Muda Gang, Ground Sick, code word, Febreze his watch that mean I clean his clock

[Round 2: Bender]
I'ma let him have this ether
I don't care if he a sweet kid who never had a beeper
Or he's so blooded out he got hemorrhagic fever
I don't care if he the nicest young man that came from your city
I don't care if he nice with the hands like Ray McKigney
I been two-fisting Blue Ribbons
Send in my new victim, I split his wig like a beautician
Musician with screws missing
Fuck this round, I two-zip him
June six him that's Doomsday, I move different
I'm old-school like Luke Wilson and Fu-Schnickens
You a thirty-something-year-old new jack, that's a huge difference
You're remarkably obnoxious, tell this bootlicker here, I'm an artist on that block shit, Cubism
If he put me in a box it'll be in a booth spitting for a rack and a half per 16 on his new mixes
Two Michelin star meal you straight out the soup kitchen
Have your room spinning like he glue-sniffing with some flu symptoms
I'm, too gifted, you wanna do business? I'm cool with it
But the, truth's vicious Fredo you should be battling school children
Couldn't save paper like news clippings
Your buzz ain't never left the ground, I'm heading out on the moon mission
I'm a beast of burden
Jump in front of the man in charge and catch a shot like the Secret Service
Should beat the birdshit out his beak for chirping
Lights go out, you see him jerking like Pee-wee Herman without a theatre curtain
And I caught him in the koi pond of my lobby with some soy sauce and wasabi
That's a fat joke not a Asian one Pinoy, I'm clocking a body
Game and Wildlife monthly, you gotta duck for cover
You came with some knuckledusters my third is a bunker buster
This is charity for you don't get a big head about it
Fuck, okay forget about it

[Round 2: Fredo]
Your face appears, like you're on your 80th beard
Shit's looking way too weird, what a waste of beard
It looks like he took somebody else's facial hair fucking shaved it off and then taped it there
Fucking Al Borland's fucking boring with his North Korean air raid
Watch me clean you off with a, Sweeney Todd European hair blade
You got a fire round? I got a fire round, shit's not a fair trade
'Cause after these bars, I'll make all of these fucking squares change from the fear like Scared Straight
I'm here, I'm righteous
Watch my stock rise up like pie crust to make you bite dust
You don't know who you fucking with, Eyes Wide Shut
Top tier, I'm the new kid on the block, hanging tough, with the right stuff
I made your ting ride the pipe just like a biker
She called me that guy 'cause I threw a Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, in her vagina
She can't fake it when I bust, facials in my nut
Fredo sauce, now she got a face full of white stuff
Bender's now afraid of Fredo 'cause his time's up and his paintings are always fifty shades of grey, to remind us, he's ashamed, 'cause his life sucks
You could hold a multi through all the winter months until fucking Christmas comes
And every two times you do battle a year you always remind everybody how you some sorta hipster, mister tough, 'I been in a Polish prison once
I roll up in a Toyota pickup truck, holding Hitler's nuts'
What else dog? You're a fucking ronin, shogun fucking with explosive ninja stunts?
What else after that? You're a roaming Trojan soldier holding gold and fisticuffs
Homie so what? No one gives a fuck
I'ma try one, I'ma try one
Fredo's more like, like Crazy Horse so I'm endangered like Jason Bourne in Asian form
I graze 'em, with a blazing sword
And, burn 'em, like a lady's scorn
I grace 'em, with a flaming orb
And crank it, till they say no more
I delivered that shit with so much power it'll bring all of the Rangers forth or it may just form, the Megazord
I'm here to let you know
I don't need a technical stethoscope to check your pulse to see your breath control is pregnant bro
Between all of your bars and every quote or sentence spoke sounds like unfinished rounds with extensive chokes
I got it locked in, on your head and throat, in a deadly scope
I'm grade-A with my melee weapon stroke
If I aim for your neck, and hit, you ain't gon' ever smoke
The F Algebra slays the less-talented with my Excalibur blade I X-out the next challenger made
I'm dead accurate aim, the shot arc, from spectacular range
I'm 'bout the shit, rap or spit
Catch Bender in a black car slipping on some trapdoor shit
Lucha libre, shit jump off I got the mask on slick
On guard, you getting what you asked for bitch
Head shot, cannon snap, give him a passport pic

[Round 3: Bender]
I swear ever since we met, you just wanted me to like you
Every time I'm on the coast, you're like "Doggy you should slide through"
Even texted me last night like "King you wanna get some drive through?"
It's not a magician's act how I saw the bitch inside you
See I was crafting my pen into a tactical weapon
While you were hanging with meth heads waiting on a batch from your chemist
Now, class is in session for the master's apprentice
How'd you think this was a mirror match, I don't have a reflection
You quit your day job, you better cash in your pension
I start infernos, Arctic Circle turn to Galveston, Texas
Came to leave a body, no astral projection
Julius Caesar getting stabbed in the Senate, I'm back with a vengeance
You can't capture the essence with camera lenses
You been gassed since you stepped in Fredo, you just gas for this engine
A massive percentage won't catch till years after I said it
Even after I'm dead, that's not the exit
They'll travel for miles to trample the entrance
And stand at attention where my casket's embedded like, Vladimir Lenin's cadaver that's kept under glass at the Kremlin
I said, God damn that's expensive
Some say I battle too intensely, for me it's rudimentary
I feel like a shooter ready for some students in a school assembly
Mazel tov, when a bottle pop on his head, it's a brutal ending
When I, stomp the glass in his temple like a Jewish wedding
I'm a jack of all trades, I mastered each one
You Mother Superior, that's a master of none
You thought you'd take out the old king, thinking you got next but papo
You not Benny Blanco, you just John Leguizamo
And shouts to FlipTop the Philippines were sick
'Round here you get sent to the airport if Anygma needs a lift
You ain't worth new bars, I start remixing schemes I did
I put a bag over ya' head, like a intravenous drip you tricked-out piece of shit you're officially dismissed

[Round 3: Fredo]
I heard you shit your pants
Ay what's your name, um squidge- Squid Milker on Instagram?
Everybody behind him y'all better make sure that shit's Saran wrap and spick and span
'Cause y'all don't want to be standing there when shit hits the fan
Al gon' get the easy pass, this whirlwind do him speedy fast
Even for your endurance, plus your girlfriend probably beat your ass
Her versus Lebron James would be a even match 'cause the bitch has Cleveland calves
One night I had Bender's bitch over
We fucked around a little then I bent the bitch over
She turned around, started caressing my neck and my shoulders
No Dot, she proceeded to reach around, that's a Dellavedova
Oil, acrylic canvas you steady painting that will
My handstyles, use human ink, and the stain is for real
It's kinda like, wearing the, spilt blood of great men you killed
The sway of the blade is instilled Kill Bill
The blood stains on my Asics is real
So why even have an ego? Avo edited that shit, we know
Versus The Saurus, I wouldn't call that a weak choke
Shit was more like a deepthroat
His tactical slurs impacted your nerves
In the middle of that shit you forgot everything while you were spitting that average-ass verse
And you were in front of the Golden Gate too and still couldn't bridge the gap to your words
Is you fucking tripping? I'll pluck your vision
If you jump, I aim above the fitted and dump
Like General Custer with the musket spitting
The pump, hold more guns than, World War I, I'm in the Bunker with it
Never fall for the okie doke
Ali-Foreman, this my biggest fight to date, I'ma rope a dope
Leg kick, you got a open throat
I'ma throw a choke over your shoulders, like a overcoat
I blow the middle of your chest out, from side to side, like a motorboat
And all of y'all can, witness me cremate the God body, and make holy smoke
If I overdose, I comatose ya' crew
I'm always woke I know just what to do
Plus the flow'll roast you too
I always show and prove, I head upwards like a totem pole was used
When this knee land, nothing but big lines like the roller coaster's new
Shit so know your role, woah you're old
Like when I was born you were probably a 24-year-old
You're about to get exposed like we on The Maury Show
I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so
And uh, ay, I'm sorry bro
