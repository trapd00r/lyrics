She's meeting no one, and I'm a tell
Time for waiting in the dark
Is it time to make him lying on the sad side
I wouldn't bother to call, a lonely line

I didn't mean it, I took it shy
Looking back at it I live, thinking you of only mine
Not a moment too late
Knowing I was a fool, I pulled away

I know what you're doing
When you say you don't wanna fight
You think in a couple weeks
The feelings that will keep me have died
I take this for granted
Cause it's easier than being precise
It's not hard to remember
I'm never gonna see you all right

Let's take a moment, let's get it right
Live a couple blocks away, do you think it's alright
That I'm overdrew too
Friday afternoon walking next to you

I thought I said it, I thought I knew
Thinking you were on your own, cause I know you like I do
Never saw you broke down
So I'm rushing my head to make this out

You took it hard when I said do you wanna see (other people)
I don't think I love you, but I could be wrong
Take a minute to call me if you wanna leave (other people)
Get it right on the month and then you go along

I know what you're doing
When you say you don't wanna fight
You think in a couple weeks
The feelings that will keep me have died
I take this for granted
Cause it's easier than being precise
It's not hard to remember
I'm never gonna see you all right
