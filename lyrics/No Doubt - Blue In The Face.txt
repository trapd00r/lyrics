Just like a bee rushing to a comb of honey
Why can't you see you look so very funny
You worry yourself sick till you're blue in the face
Relax and sleep, tomorrow isn't leaving
And counting your sheep won't relieve you from this grieving
You worry yourself sick till you're blue in the face

But you'll make ends meet I know you will so please pull up a chair
Take your time the world's not going anywhere
Honey, you worry yourself sick till you're blue in the face

Blue in the face
'Cause you're always in a hurry
Blue in the face
'Cause you always tend to worry
You're just like a honey bee, you panic, you sting, then you die

It's just like you to fret like you do
So take the afternoon and maybe someday soon
You won't have to worry yourself sick till you're blue in the face

But you'll make ends meet I know you will so please pull up a chair
And take your time the world's not going anywhere
Honey, you worry yourself sick till you're blue in the face

Blue in the face
'Cause you're always in a hurry
Blue in the face
'Cause you always tend to worry
You're just like a honey bee, you panic, you sting, then you die
You're just like a honey bee Zap!

Oh, when you're in a state of mind they call anxiety
And you find it very necessary to pull out your hair
Don't be discouraged
Oh, honey have courage
Don't worry yourself sick till you're blue in the face
Like always you worry till you're blue in the face
Honey why worry yourself sick till you're blue in the face

You're always in a hurry
Blue in the face
You always tend to worry
'Cause you're just like a honey bee, you panic, you sting, then you die
Just like a honey bee

Blue in the face
You got no time to waste
Slow down the pace
You're turning blue, blue, blue

Blue in the face
You got no time to waste
Slow down the pace
You're turning blue
