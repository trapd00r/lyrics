Eminem
Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak. 
When you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up. 
But you gotta search within you. 
Gotta find that inner strength and just pull that shit outta you and get that motivation, to not give up and not be a quitter. 
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps as long as you feel 'em. 
Till the day that I drop You'll never say that I'm not killin' em. 
'Cause when I'm not, then I'ma stop pinnin' em 
And I am not hip hop, and I'm just not Eminem. 
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sinnin 
Women are caught in webs spin'em and hock venom 
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop 
Amoxicillin's just not real enough. 
The criminal cop killin' hip hop villain a minimal swap 
To cop millions of Pac listeners. 
You're coming with me, feel it or not 
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of god lives in us. 
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock 
Is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up? 
Fa shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot listen up. 
You bizzles forgot, slizzle does not give a fuck.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
Till my legs give out can't shut my mouth 
Till the smoke clears out  - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse 

background
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs) 
Give out from underneath me. 

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
Till my legs give out can't shut my mouth 
Till the smoke clears out  - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Music is like magic. There's a certain feeling you get 
When you're real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit. 
This is your moment and every single minute you spend 
Trynna hold on to it, cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, trynna get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's in it's end
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in 
It goes Reggie, Jay Z, Tupac and Biggie 
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurrupt, Nas and then me. 
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lotta envy. 
So when I'm not put in this list, the shit does not offend me. 
That's why you see me walkin' 'round like nothing's bothering me. 
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me. 
You hate it but you know respect you gotta give me. 
The press' wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me!

Eminem
Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word 
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack, I'm launchin' at them
The track is on some battling rap, who wants some static
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is rad cause I'm not the raddest, so

I, I will not fall. 
I will stand tall. 
Feels like no one can beat me.
