I've never felt so calm
You would never upset me
Or do me any harm
I sense a lack of fear
Ever since the day we moved here
Nothing frightens me at all
No one here falls in love
I fall asleep on someone's arm

Nights in goodville
Are too quiet and too calm
Winds don't blow here
But I'll never be untrue

No I swore to never leave you
And I always keep my word
And I never lose my way

You know there's just one road for us to walk down
Now let's see how far it goes
I want to fall in love
And maybe you're not the one
But perhaps you could be
But if loving you is hard
Please don't hate me
Please don't hate me

But the current in this water
Is not as rapid as the flow
Of love when it washes over
And one time i saw it coming
But i was too afraid of letting go
So i let it flow right past me
I think we fell in love

Yes i think he was the one
But perhaps you could be
But the nights here are so still
Not a whisper in goodville
Not a whisper in goodville
