I'm careful not to fall
I have to climb your wall
'Cause you're the one
Who makes me feel much taller than you are 
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Problems with the booze
Nothing left to lose 
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared 
The face that fills the hole
That stole my broken soul
The one that makes me seem to feel much taller than you are 
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Troubles with the gear
Nothing left to fear 
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
With every bet I lost
And every trick I tossed
You're still the one who makes me feel much taller than you are
I'm just a peeping tom
On my own for far too long
Problems with the booze
Nothing left to lose
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm weightless... I'm bare
I'm faithless... I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared
