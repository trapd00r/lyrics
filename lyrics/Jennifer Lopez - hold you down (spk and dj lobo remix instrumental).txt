[J.Lo]
Now you've been holding me down, mmm
For such a long time now
From back then till now in my story
Straight from the hood you've always been there for me
And ya had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you who kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you, yeah

[Fat Joe]
Reminiscing that six train from way back
Now its sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs
From sweeping them floors in them Bronx apartments to
"Mira, esta que on that red carpet"
When Pun died you was the first to call me
I never told you but you was there for me
Whatever you need, I'll be there for you
Crack - I got ya back
For real, true story

[J.Lo]
Now my loyalty will always be
With you, if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
'Cause baby you don't have to change, no

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you're down
You know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation
Boy, I'm gon' hold you down

[Fat Joe]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you down
You know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation
Girl, I'm gon' hold you down

The realest fresher from BX
To South Beach

You can count on me

So remember this whenever I call
We go back too far
We've been through it all
Even though we haven't spoke
In so long
Ain't nothing changed
Not a damn thing, baby

Like green, it's the autumns
Things will stay
This industry, yeah, I fought
Made me this way
Get between me and J.Lo
I simply stay
You better off sweepin' leaves
On a windy day (no)

[J.Lo]
So I don't care about the situation
I'ma ride for you if there's a complication
Every time you had my back and all
When we were young
Now you're Joey Crack and all

Now my loyalty, will always be
