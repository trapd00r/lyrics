When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feeling
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town

'Cause we're the party people night and day
Living crazy, that's the only way

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all
Live life off the wall
Live your life off the wall
Live it off the wall

You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all getting loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down

'Cause we're the party people night and day
Living crazy, that's the only way

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all
Live life off the wall
Live your life off the wall
Live it off the wall

Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you (ain't no rules, it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party all right through the night (all right)

Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition
Better do it now before you get too old

'Cause we're the party people night and day
Living crazy, that's the only way

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all (live it off the wall)
Live your life off the wall

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all if you live it off the wall

Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf (yeah)
And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (wanna live)

Tonight (yeah, yeah), gotta leave that nine to five up on the shelf (nine to five)
And just enjoy yourself (come on and groove, yeah)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (yeah)
