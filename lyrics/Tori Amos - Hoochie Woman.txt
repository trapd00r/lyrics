I wasn't thinking, my head was in the book
His hands were on her everywhere
I saw his face, I dropped my coffee
He's cheating on me with a hoochie woman

You can keep your hoochie
You can keep the house
And the bank accounts
'Cause, boy, I bring home the bacon

I went to work and the office girls
Were all burning their poetry
It wasn't good but in the neighborhood
Now they're all just a hoochie woman

You can keep your hoochie
You can keep the house
And the bank accounts
'Cause, boy, I bring home the bacon
I said, boys, I bring home the bacon now

He called me up and said, "She has needs"
I said, "You'll find them on Barney's fourth floor"
He said, "I need a loan", I said, "That's not a problem
You better keep this from your hoochie woman"

You can keep your hoochie
You can keep the house
And the bank accounts
'Cause, boy, I bring home the bacon
I said, girls, I bring home the bacon now
