It was a party night, everybody was breaking
The highs were screaming and the bass was shaking
And it won't be long till everybody knows when that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going
And and and and
Sha na na
Italian, Caucasian, Japanese
Spanish, Indian, Negro and Vietnamese
MCs, disc jockeys to all the fly kids and the young ladies
Introducing the crew ya got to see to believe
We're one, two, three, four, five MCs
I'm Melle Mel and I rock it so well
And I'm Mr. Ness because I rocks the best
I'm Rahiem in all the ladies' dreams
And I'm Cowboy to make ya jump for joy
I'm Creole, solid gold
The Kid Creole playing the role
Dig this, we're the Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash
Giving you a blast and sure enough class
So to prove to ya all that we're second to none
We're gonna make five mcs sound like one
Ya gotta dip dip dive, so so socialize
Clean out your ears then open your eyes
And then pay at the door as a donation
To hear the best sounds in creation
He's a disco dream of a mean machine
And when it comes to size, ya see what we mean
Ya see his name is not found in the hall of fame but he'll shock
And amaze ya and make ya feel shame
He takes a lime from a lemon
And from a lemon to a lime
He cuts the beat in half the time
And as sure is 3 times 2 is 6
You'll say Flash is the king of the quick mix
We're five mc's and we're on our own
And we're the most well known on the microphone
And we throw down hard and we aim to please
With finesse to impress all the young ladies
We got rhymes galore and that's a fact
And if the satisfaction's guaranteed to cause a heart attack
We are the best as you can see
So eliminate the possibility
That to be an e-m-c-e-e
Is not a threat to society
Say step by step
Stride by stride
I know the fly young lady would like to ride
In my mercedes, 'young ladies'
In my mercedes, 'young ladies'
If my Mercedes breakdown and dull my grill
I will drive up in a new Seville
If my Seville break down, I take it back
I will dull my grill in a new Cadillac
If my Cadillac break down, it's too much
I will shock your mind in a new Star Stutz
And if a Stutz break down, I make another choice
I will dull my grill in a new Rolls Royce
And if a Royce break down, I'll be out in the rain
And then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Huh, take the train
Take the train, take the train
Can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down, cause I get down

Ladies who don't know my name
And you fellas who don't know my game
Yes I'm called the prnce of soul
But others call me the Kid Creole
The mc delight, young ladies bite
When I'm on the mike and I rock the house right
I'm the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold
Rockin to the rhythm while I'm playing the role
A cool calm customer, the master plan
It takes a sucker's man to try to jump my hand
And the things I do and what I say
Affect a lot of people in the strangest way
Makes them clap their hands and say 'all right'
Creole to the broad daylight
Mr. Ness, my mellow, what he look like
With ya on the mike

Let's rock y'all, a let's rock the house
Because the Furious Five are gonna turn it out
So young ladies, if you think ya heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Yes, it's true that we gotta fuss
Because it can't be the best unless it came from us
There's five of us and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we coming through rough
We number one ain't nothin' you can do
And if you wanna get down we'll rock you too
So free-formin y'all, ya don't stop
Come on, come on and let me see 'a rock rock
Cowboy, they say you're from the bronx
So why don't you rock the beat and add a little spunk

Yes yes, y'all and ya don't stop
Come on fly girls, I wanna hit the top
I am the c-o-w-b-o-y
Why the man so bad that ya deny
You better watch your woman cause I'll tell you why
Cause I'm Cowboy, I might give her a try
They call me Keith Keith
The young ladies' relief
Know as the man of romance to make you dance
Can any of you ladies stand a chance?
I'm Cowboy and I'm shockin the house
Ya say, ya say 1, 2, 1 more is 3
And Melle Mel, come on, whatcha got for me?

To the hip hop, a hip hop, a don't stop, don't stop that body rock
Just get off your seat, get ready to clap
Because Melle Mel is starting here to rap
Ever since the time at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself at the top of the chart
Rapping on the mic, making cold cold cash
With a jockey spinnin for me called DJ Flash
Signing autographs for the the young and old
Wearing big time silver and solid gold
My name on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on the TV screen
It's ain't like that yet, but -huh- you'll see
I got potential and you will agree
I'm coming up and I got a step above the rest
Cause I'm using the ladder they call success
You say 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
Rap like hell and make it sound like heaven
A 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 come on Rahiem come and get some

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, come on, come on, huh
I wanna hit the top
I'm the one of a kind, the man supreme
I know I'm in all the ladies' dreams
I'm the r-a-h and the i-e-m
I put a wiggle in your butt if a tell me when
I'm a son of a gun with a hell of a fire
Got to mess around and take ya all higher
My clientele climb the great big boost
I'm the give it up and turn it loose, huh
All you fly girls that don't know my game
Come up and talk to me and we'll tell you all the same
When ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem
In all the ladies' dreams

And makin' more currency than any mc
And if the dream will turn to reality
And Melle Mel'll be makin' money
Mr. Ness, make makin' money
Rahiem, makin' money
Cowboy , make makin' money
Creole, makin' money
DJ Flash, make makin' money
Hit it

Take your time and you will agree
That Black Door got good security
So when you walk through the door, just do me a favor
Be sure to be on your best behavior
Young man, what do you wanna do
When the party is through
And a lady wanna go home with you
You search your pocket, ya soon aware
That you don't have enough for cab fare
So you say to yourself what a mistake you made
Your heart start pumpin' right on Kool-Aid
When she walks to you and starts to say
'Call one-double-o' get down with o.j
And you pave the way....
Young ladies a lot, young ladies galore, young ladies, we do adore
