A ray of hope flickers at the sky, 
A tiny star lights the way up high, 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn, 
This comes to pass, when a child is born. 

A silent wish sails the seven seas, 
The wind of change whispers in the trees, 
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn, 
This comes to pass, when a child is born. 

A rosy hue settles all around, 
You got the feel, you're on solid ground, 
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn, 
This comes to pass, when a child is born. 

It's all a dream and an illusion now, 
It must come true sometime soon somehow, 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn, 
This comes to pass, when a child is born.
