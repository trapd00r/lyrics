I see the ocean when I look into your eyes
A depth of green I know to drown in it would be nice
A perfect creature born in this imperfect world
I know all of your secrets that you kept untold
It’s a magic rite
Don’t know black or white
Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this story’s so ancient
Ancient but every time it’s new
I feel your presence even when you’re far away
You are my star at midnight, you’re the light of day
You have two faces, you’re the angel, you’re the beast
I knew your love and now I’m falling to abyss
It’s a magic rite
Don’t know black or white
Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this story’s so ancient
Ancient but every time it’s new
Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this story’s so ancient
Ancient but every time it’s new
Tension, invisible tension
Strange game between me and you
Ancient, this story’s so ancient
Ancient but every time it’s new
