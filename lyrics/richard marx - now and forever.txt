Whenever I'm weary
From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever, I will be your man

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
And if I'd only known you were there
Reaching out to touch you, reaching to the stars

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever, I will be your man
Now and forever, I will be your man
