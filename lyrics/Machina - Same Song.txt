A bastard at conception ring

Takes the place a mistake

A love that is cherished

So surface and purposely fake

Ashamed and afraid the child

Grows in shadows alone

Nothing or no one to hold onto

Or call his own he runs away

You keep on singing the same song

You tell me that I'm to blame

I'll keep on singing the same song

Over and over again

Slipping through the cracks 

Of the system 

Slithering like a snake

Struggling to survive

Scraping everything he can 

Just to eat

Screaming now ceiling is peeling

I feel for my faith

Trapped in my body these demons

Destruct and escape

Burning with pleasure this flesh

Is so withered and raped

I feel so tired

Desire has made me less

Can I be whole again?

You keep on singing the same song

You tell me that I'm to blame

I'll keep on singing the same song

Over and over again

When all the pieces fall

Who do I turn to now?

The light is closing in

Have to re-begin

Well it's almost over now

All this pain that I've allowed

To nest inside my soul

Let it go...

You keep on singing the same song

You tell me that I'm to blame

I'll keep on singing the same song

Over and over again
