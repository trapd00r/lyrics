Workin' on the railroad all day long
Workin' on the railroad sing this song
Sing about an old love I once knew
Sing about an old love maybe two
Workin' on the railroad
Workin' on the railroad
Work... work... workin' on the... railroad

I drove a hot steel in my time
I drink a lot of stuff they call moonshine
I got me a woman in every town
Workin' on the railroad, never settle down
Workin' on the railroad
Workin' on the railroad
Work... work... workin' on the... railroad

I draw my pay on a Saturday night
Go in town and had start a fight
Love me a woman a laugh and a joke
Workin' on the railroad, always abroke
Workin' on the railroad
Workin' on the railroad
Work... work... workin' on the... railroad

When I die and you bury me
Alongside the tracks where I wanna be
Don't you cry friend just remember this
There ain't much you all 'body miss
Workin' on the railroad
Workin' on the railroad
Work... work... workin' on the... railroad
