You're playing your pieces
You're setting me up
Trying to knock me down
You don't have a reason
That I can believe in
To push me round

You're creating a highway of lies
One by one

No matter what you say or do
I won't fall like a domino
Matter how you sway (you sway)
The truth, (ah, ah, ah)
I won't fall like a domino
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a domino

I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a domino

You're writing me letters
You think you know better
What's right and wrong
You think you're perfection
And that my direction
Just doesn't belong

You're making a fool of yourself
You're so far gone

No matter what you say or do
I won't fall like a domino
Matter how you sway (you sway)
The truth, (ah, ah, ah)
I won't fall like a domino
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a domino

I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a domino

You'll reap the things you sow
You'll go down like a domino
Just watch me from below
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a domino

(No matter what you say) or do
I won't fall like a domino
Matter how you sway (you sway)
The truth, (ah, ah, ah)
I won't fall like a domino
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a domino

(I won't fall like a)
I won't fall like a
I won't fall like a domino

(Ah, ah, ah)
I won't fall like a domino
(Ah, ah, ah)
I won't fall like a domino
