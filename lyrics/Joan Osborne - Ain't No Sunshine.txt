Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
It's not warm when he's away
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And he's always gone too long anytime he goes away

Wonder this time where he's gone
Wonder if he's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know

Hey I'll leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when he's gone
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
Only darkness everyday

Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
