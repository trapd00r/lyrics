A childless widow of a nation
You cry like guns across the water
Yet we expect you to bring Springtime
It isn't fair
Searchlights wither in your hair
You are a silent movie, Sarah

Men build their industries around you
Diverting rivers of your hair
They're looking for their on reflection
You're left to die of exposure, Sarah

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
Sarah with the
You are a silent movie, Sarah

Let her go, the light is fading
I cry like guns across the water
She didn't ask to be your remake or your muse
We're parasites inside her blues

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is no one home
Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is only echo

From a recording machine
Screaming, "Haunt your own vampire dreams"

You see our poets  (Poets)
Do an odious business
Loving womankind  (Womankind)
As lions love Christians so
Who are you to deny
Who are you to deny them, Sarah?
