[Logic:]
It's a, it's a vibe
Ultimata!
All my homies we all on the studio tour bus right now
This is Stoney Bob live in a room from wherever the fuck we are today on tour
I've already rolled about four blunts
It's 3: 38 PM
I'm going off, here we go

What up, what's good? I'm running through your hood
I'm feeling like I should, I wish a motherfucker would
Bobby be my name
I'm 'bout to run a train on this girl with all my boys and her name is Mary Jane
'Cause I burn big dope with my dogs
Joe Clay rolled a blunt so big this shit look like a log
In my dressing room but I can't see through all the fog
6ix supply the kicks like karate
I was fighting with the idea of smoking' again
And now I got my green belt
And that's the longest line without a rhyme
But the punch before the line about the line was so divine
For shizzle my nizzle, I feel like D-O-double Gizzle on this grizzle, my nizzle
Put the greenery on the grill and let it sizzle, my nizzle
It don't matter the season Bobby let it burn when it drizzle
I won't lie, I'll put my right hand on the Bible and tell the world that me and Berner got a strain of the cookie
That shit is so simply just undeniable
It'll make your world shatter like glass
And I ain't talking bout them dabs

(Hoo-ha!)
What's the haps on the craps?
(Hoo-ha!)
Stoney Bob bring it back
(Hoo-ha!)
Stoney Bob want a snack
(Hoo-ha!)
Stoney Bob got the pack
(Hoo-ha!)
What's the craps on the motherfuckin'-fucked that line up
Nice

[Kajo & Logic:]
You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you
I wanna smoke with you
I'm coming to get you
Girl, you know I gotta hit you like
You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you
I wanna smoke with you
I'm coming to get you
Girl, you know I gotta hit you like

[Slaydro:]
Mary Jane, I never been the same since our lips locked
The only lady that never gets pissed off
And if there's one thing I know
It's how to roll a J and let it burn real slow
For those who don't know, I go by Slaydro
Ready, set, go
I take one to the dome like Pablo Esco
Germinate the seed, then just let it grow
Then harvest like a pro
Dodging cops just to cop digits
Made the packs move and flip like they was gymnasts
Got me seeing trick green night vision
All truth, no fiction
Always fried like Popeye's Chicken
Hella mother hella motherfucker so you know I'm always know I'm always running late
Unless that currency at stake
In this Ruth Chris because I'm ruthless
Forty in the-forty in the trunk gone in 20 minutes
That's 80K for the ticket
Every-everybody fucking with it
Smoking the container bet I'm always gon' retain it
That's it

[Kajo & Logic:]
You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you
I wanna smoke with you
I'm coming to get you
Girl, you know I gotta hit you like
You make me feel so amazing
I wanna ride with you
I wanna smoke with you
I'm coming to get you
Girl, you know I gotta hit you like

[Big Lenbo:]
It ain't nothing, joint stuffing, rolling blunts and
Big buds for breakfast crumble like a muffin
No discussion, smoke a big dope with the fam
Stoney on the bus, used to hot box a van
In and out the cities
Group the women and the weed
All these male groupies stepping unless you got tree
Better roll it and smoke it to the last drop
That cash crop stay up in the hash spot
Daily session, that Buddha blessing, never stressing
Laid back but I keep the whistle like I'm reffing
That's some rap nigga shit
We Hugh Heffin'
Smoke out the grotto
Feeling like Pablo
Saucing like tomato
Pull them numbers like lotto
