(Obie Trice)
Every man determines
His definition of realness
What's real to him
Everybody got their own definition
Gangster man
Ok
Well, this is my definition
Of gangster, nigger

Surprise, motherfuckers
You thought I would never rise, motherfuckers
This Obie Trice, motherfuckers
Look in the eyes of a real guy
I ain't got the time for lies
Niggers frontin' like they lyin'
Nigger, you're not tough, we seize the bluff
These streets is too heated up for you to front
Dre laced the beat, heated up for you to bomb
Real name, no gimmicks
Givin' my niggers what they want
Fuck an image and a blunt, that ain't rap, dogg
Be who you wanna be but let it be fact, dogg
Don't ever let a nigger tell you
How you should act, dogg
Especially when your fuckin'
With automatics gats, dogg
These niggers ain't playin', I'm sayin'
I'm sprayin', do my dirty work with my hands
I'm a man, layin' a nigger down, he advance
You fuckin' with my plans, I'm lookin' for the truth

(Nate Dogg)
Look In My Eyes, 'cause I can love, I can hate
'Cause it's a thin line, walk around with my chest out
Like I got nine lives, never will, bitch, I'm just strapped
Before I find mine wonder what the future is like

Look In My Eyes, real G's anticipate
They got to have mine, all the hoes coppin' me out
Think it's about time niggers never open they mouth
'Cause they know I kinda find hard to figure me out
Look In My Eyes

(Obie Trice)
Aiyo, Obie's lookin' back
They askin' Obie 'How you cope with that'?
I cope estically man, I'm Kobe Bryant rap
I'm so defiant that the lines I'm invitin' on rhyme
I swear I'm outta my mind's sometimes
Out on the grind, my kind
Nickel and dime niggers, we ain't rich yet
We on the corner with a .40 and biscuit
Ready for bitch shit
Heavy drinkin', we ain't got good sense
My hood so tense, niggers so dense
I see through the life you invent
Slow up on how you niggers vent
You niggers ain't repestin' shit
I represent School Craft killers
Detroit nigger, my nigger, what?
The Realest
Exploitin' niggers, my nigger, what?
It's the point in the void, you fillin'
You feel us, we drillin' you with lyrics motherfuckers
Real life experiences
Eminem gave the clearance
So I'm here to show you niggers brilliance
Buildin' Shady Marine, no civilian
O Trice you're fuckin' with real proveliance

(Nate Dogg)
Look In My Eyes, 'cause I can love, I can hate
'Cause it's a thin line, walk around with my chest out

They got to have mine, all the hoes coppin' me out
Think it's about time niggers never open they mouth
'Cause they know I kinda find hard to figure me out
Look In My Eyes

(Obie Trice)
This is what the streets done to me
Hungry, gun on me
Hopes high on the Key
Change of Community
Givin' up immunity
Raise future me's
You Look In My Eye's
Yeah, that's the dream Obie's seein'
And it seems as easy
As the rhymes Obie brings
But my eye's shows things intervene
All in-betweens like losin' my team
Losin' my freedom
Losin' my mind and the bein'
Bein' I'm bein', graduated from rice to beans
To obedience, congratulated on lights
I don' came too far to go backwards
My aim too extrane for y'all

(Obie Trice)
Yeah
Look In My Eyes man
It ain't shit but real talk
Over here nigger
I would never send you else where
I got hair on my nuts, nigger
Grown man shit
That's how a nigger
Gettin' into to clubs, nigger
When I ain't got no ID
Flash my nuts on they ass
And bumped me right in, nigger
Ha ha, yeah
