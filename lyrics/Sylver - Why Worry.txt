Stones are getting colder
Leaves are turning brown
Paintings lose their color
Kings lay down their crown

Why worry
Why worry
I'm still here for you
Why worry
Why worry
Cause my love will always shine on you

Nights are getting longer
Soldiers lost their faith
Dreamers have stopped dreaming
Heaven no longer waits
Earth has stopped revolving
The moon has lost its glow
Seasons have stopped turning
Rivers no longer flow

Why worry
Why worry
I'm still here for you
Why worry
Why worry
'Cause my life will always shine on you

Why worry
Why worry
I'm still here for you
Why worry
Why worry
'Cause my life will always shine on you

Sometimes the one thing
That you're looking for
Will be the one thing
You can't see

Why worry
Why worry
I'm still here for you
Why worry
Why worry
'Cause my life will always shine on you

Why worry
Why worry
I'm still here for you
Why worry
Why worry
'Cause my life will always shine on you

Why worry
Why worry
I'm still here for you
Why worry
Why worry
'Cause my life will always shine on you
