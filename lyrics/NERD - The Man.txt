Revolution!

Yeah

(Pharrell)
All I know is I can't get the recipe
For how to make my pie taste just like the tree
Oh it's so revealing, feeling I have no feeling
But I bet they tell you don't worry 'bout it just add the cream

And then you feel good! [3x]
Let it go and you should feel good!
Here we go...

(Pharrell)
How does every man endure the heckling?
Every phone, internet, and TV selling pie
Tell me the type of pie it is, that's your vision buying it
Don't bother with hello, just say buy/bye

(N.E.R.D.)
Here we go, here we go
Uh, uh
Hello, how are you-ah?
Just stopped a second on my cruiser
Nice to meet ya, wanna recruit ya
To the muffin girls of the future
Let me school ya, and renew ya
(Free your mind!) Hallelujah
First I move ya, then go through ya
When I do ya

[Chorus] - "here we go"

All my muffins!
Revolution
Liberation
Hm-mmm-hmmmm [3X]
