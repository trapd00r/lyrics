Load up on guns and bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, oh

I'm worse at what, what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will be until the end

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

Hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
Yes

A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
A denial, a denial, a denial, yes
A denial
