The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's somethin' in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, on Dre's phantom, believe me clowns
That means suicide homie
You'll never throw me off of this course, blow me
Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, im not just talkin' awards homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely on top of the world
When you're the only one with the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' your boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
I'm moppin' the floors with em, I keep tryin' to pass it
But they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be long 'til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors
And no we ain't pumpkins on Halloween
But we'll show up on your porch
So be careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like im S-N-Double O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over

And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh

And I miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
And homie I'll never forget you, nooo

For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that's the best thing I can do right now, Doody for you is to rep
So im gonna fuck till I die, yeah I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need 2 mic's
'Cause the way im feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin' that I could do wrong, im too strong and im just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and bust it
Excuse the corny metaphor but they'll never ketchup to all this energy that I've mustard
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryin' to process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show em, blow em out the water, slaughter em homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below em
Homie I know im never gonna be the same without you
I never would have came in this game, im goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me "naw Doody you're not", layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said "think of Hailie", I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies
And Proof, not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, im so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you, I love you Doody

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, im growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone but you're never over

And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh

And I miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
I just miss you, ohhh
And homie I'll never forget you, nooo
