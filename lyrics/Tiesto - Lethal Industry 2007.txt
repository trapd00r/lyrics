When it seems like the world around you's breaking
And it feels like there's no one else around you
And it's quiet, there's a silence in the darkness
And it sounds like the carnival is over

As you walk in the crowded empty spaces
And you stare at the emptiness around you
You wanna go to the city and the bright lights
And get away from the sinners that surround you

Cause I will be there and you will be there
We'll find each other in the dark
And you will see and I'll see it too
Cause we'll be together in the dark

Cause if it's coming for you then it's coming for me
Cause I will be there
Cause we need each other in the dark

And if it terrifies you then it terrifies me
Cause I will be there
So we've got each other in the dark

As I look into the sky, the sparks bright as ice
You want me to take you over there
I want you to stay with me
Cause you're not the only one
The only one

No no
Don't worry, you're not the only one

Cause if it's coming for you then it's coming for me
But I will be there
Cause we need each other in the dark

And if it's panicking you then it's panicking me
But I will be there
So we've got each other in the dark

In the dark
In the dark
We'll need each other in the dark
In the dark
In the dark
We'll hold each other in the dark
Now we're safe together in the dark
Cause we've got each other in the dark
