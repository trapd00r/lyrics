I can wake up to a bad day
I know how to go from there
But you, I can't handle

It's not that you are not welcome
You're amazing in my eyes
It's me that changed too much around you

You are one of those people

I can think of a million reasons
Times when I should shut my mouth
But I feel like a fool around you

You are one of those people
That just ain't good for everyone
I have nothing against you people
But I don't like what I've become

We will never know each other
It's not much to cry about
But why I get so strange around you
Might be something to work out
