White boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect

Mama can I kiss you? daddy can I kiss? (no)
(I wish you well) Innocence passed me by
Wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
(I wish you well, I wish you well)
Wanna come quick and die

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
(Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone?
All the little fragile champion boys
(Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun
Even if you disagree

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect

Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
(Even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well
