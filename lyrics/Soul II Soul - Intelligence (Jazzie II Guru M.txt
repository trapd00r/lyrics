TRANSCRIBING

[Intro: Jazzie B]
The man with an 'S' on his chest
In full effect

[Verse 1: Jazzie B]
Resign the rhyme of verbalized instructions
Combined with the musical production
Cause in time and in sync, and separately linked
Designed in the mind just to make you think
About what and how you do is what you wanna do
Inspire the desire to require what is true to you
All things in life are possible
Well develop it, to its mental impotential
Fullest effect, you know, plain and simple
Make it perfect in the eyes of all that have to see
Cause that's the way it was meant to be
Assuming your position, conceded with the mission
Cause aim's in sight just guided by a vision
To become a chooser of your inner soul
And in your minds I hold

[Chorus: Kofi]
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Jazzie B]
We were created by [?], guided by instincts
Living on parole in fact to make you think
About your situation, do you like it?
Your history, I said would you rewrite it?
Well, I would, cause if I could [?]
Now I know just what I should do
I'll be effective, productive, I make it so that I can live
In existence, and go the distance
With no resistance by being persistent
In my ideas for better living, you see?
I'm that feeling with the negative aspects, misguided concepts
That would lead and breed to ignorance
Cause I'm positive and in the mind
And I'm always, gaining intelligence

[Chorus: Kofi]
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Jazzie B]
When to maintain and obtain and then sustain a way
In which we all, can remain
Individual in our own rights
We know what we know and feel is just right
Well achieving all of the levels that report possible
Where all things in life are probable
In time with the patience, worth the waiting
Peace, not war. Love, not hating
Demand in a fair share and equal opportunity
To taste the way life was meant to be
Individually achieving, collectively gaining
Positive is strong and always maintaining
A way to stay ahead in this game
But it's not the same
To each its own to come to terms
With the things you can learn

[Chorus: Kofi]
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, what is soul to soul?
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
