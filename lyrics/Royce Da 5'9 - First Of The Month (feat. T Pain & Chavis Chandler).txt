[T-Pain:]
I made a choice
I'm rolling with Royce
Everything is everything but I need a better ring
I'm married to the game so I got both of us wedding rings
On everything, T-P's the wedding singer
We only make head bangers
I'm leaving em' dead and I ain't' scared

[Chavis Chandler:]
It's the first of the month
I got my bag in the mail
I was panicking yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on, we on, yeah
It's the first of the month
I got my bag in the mail
I'm turning back up my radio
I hope I never be alone
Be alone, yeah

[Royce Da 5'9":]
Said it's the first of the month
Got bitches calling my phone
Just payed a couple of bills
Just got some shit cut back on
I gave my Momma some money
So she can go out and gamble
God only put on me, what he know that I can handle
But it's the first of the month
I'm puttin' some rims on my car
My lady said it's a waste, bullshit I'm a star
Leave me alone, she jealous anytime I'm gon shine
She said if you so talented why
Nobody ain't ever heard of ya
She dumps me on the 20th, takes me back by the 30th
She's wrong, but we been together such a long time

[Chavis Chandler:]
It's the first of the month
I got my bag in the mail
I was panicking yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on, we on, yeah
It's the first of the month
I got my bag in the mail
I'm turning back up my radio
I hope I never be alone
Be alone, yeah

[Chavis Chandler & T-Pain:]
Ay, my life's like heaven
That's from the first of the month, until the 7th
And from the 17th to the end it's like heaven
We go from buying back to selling
Ay, I live like a king, by way of delivery of a mailman
Oh no no, hello

[T-Pain:]
I'm tryna' be loyal to never going broke again
The money, the power, respect is my only good friends
So I put a ring on the game
I'ma put a chain on it later
Now I got the hang of the game
I'ma make it rain for ya baby
Now, I put the work in
So if anybody asks about me just tell em' I'm working
If you not talkin' bout money then you get the do not disturbin'
Talk down on the game get one of them nerves in
If I ever fucked up a friendship I'm sorry
Money don't buy happiness, I go and cry in a Ferrari
We get kicked out the room, I'ma move the shit down to the lobby
Cause I got my back in the mail, I'm happy as hell, bitch its time to party cause...
