So tender are my thoughts of you
Still warm after the glow
The stones are too soft to throw

Memory loves you

The sadness has got new tears
Now they're falling gently on the grown
So invisible and clear

Memory loves you
Memory loves you

The escape has lost its ways
It ended deep in my own cave (Nothing left to do)
So what belongs will stay (Memories of you)

Memory loves you
Memory loves you
Memory loves you
Memory loves you
