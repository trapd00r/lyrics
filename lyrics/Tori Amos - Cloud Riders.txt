Standing on the edge of the cliff
Didn't think it would come to this
A dead calm before the storm
Not a sound from their engines
From the other side
Saw a shooting star at 4:22 am

A warning shot from the rhythm demons
Or from the guitar preachers
I've been touched by both
And by the holy ghost
From the other side
Saw a shooting star at 4:22 am

Underneath the stars above
I said, "No stop. I am not giving up on us"
And I am not going anywhere soon
Annie grab your bass guitar
Help me bring in the October moon

Then you shout, "Run for cover"
I scream, "Rev the Triumph's engine"
You say, "Baby, we're too late
From the cloud riders, no escape"
Darlin' what's the blanket for?
Riding out this storm
We'll be riding out this storm

Carved a stave against the grain
At the nine doors to gain
The secrets of trees
Once I could hear them singing
From the other side

Back then the thunder gods
They used to cast our lots
But then I lost touch
Close to when her chariot
From the other side

A chariot pulled by cats
Purring, "We'll be returning"
From the other side
"Girl, it's time you take back your life"

Underneath the stars above
I said, "No stop. I am not giving up on us"
And I am not going anywhere soon
Annie grab your bass guitar
Help me bring in the October moon

Then you shout, "Run for cover"
I scream, "Rev the Triumph's engine"
You say, "Baby, we're too late
From the cloud riders, no escape"
Darlin' what's the blanket for?
Riding out this storm
We'll be riding out this storm

This storm
This storm
This storm
This storm
