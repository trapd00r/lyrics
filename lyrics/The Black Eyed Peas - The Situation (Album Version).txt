Some times I pick the flower
'Cause I wanna know
He loves me not
He loves me lot
He's got to go

Not talking 'bout the dude
That's on the go go go

The situation that we got
Is so much more

You make me laugh
You make me cry
But I want you
Right by my side
And if you go I could die
You bring me low, you bring me high

I build you high
You break me down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me up
I let you down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

My therapist told me that opposites atract
I wish that she was here when opposites attacked

You love me then you hate
What's it going to be

Don't wanna miss the magic
That is you and me

You make me glow
You make me shine
We always fight right on time
And if you go I could die
You bring me low, you bring be high

I build you high
You break me down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me up
I let you down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

Sometimes we don't see each other eye to eye baby
We up and down like a rollercoaster ride baby
Sometimes you don't see the way I try baby
I hate the way you make me wanna cry lady
I wanna fly away
Sometimes I need a break
The way you treat me made me wanna go and say
But I can go on
Without you in my arm
I can't resist the way you used me with your charm

You make me glow
You make me shine
We always fight right on time
And if you go I could die
You bring me low, you bring be high

I build you high
You break me down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me up
I let you down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

I build you high
You break me down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion

You pick me up
I let you down
And that's the story of our situ-a-a-a-tion
