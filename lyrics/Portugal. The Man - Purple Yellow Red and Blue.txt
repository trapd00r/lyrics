All I
Wanna do is
Live in ecstasy
I know what's best for me

I can't help it
It's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple yellow red and blue

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

When I grow up I wanna be
A movie star or on TV
'Cause workin' just don't work for me
But I can't focus feeling hopeless
So I'll just sit back, try to look mean

All I
Wanna do is
Live in ecstasy
I know what's best for me

I can't help it
It's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple yellow red and blue

When I grow up I wanna be
A rich-kid born celebrity
It's not greed, but necessity
Now I don't focus on the hopeless
When I look out, it's only for me

All I
Wanna do is
Live in ecstasy
I know what's best for me

I can't help it
It's this hopeless itch
I just wanna feel (wanna feel)
Purple yellow red and blue

I just wanna be evil
I just wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
I just wanna be evil

I just wanna be evil
I just wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
Wanna be evil
Purple yellow red and blue

Ooh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

All that I needed
Is something to believe in
'Cause everything just falls in place like that
