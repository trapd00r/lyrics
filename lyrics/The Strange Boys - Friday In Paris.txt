I walked away 
from everyone i know
i looked around and thought 
this must be what it's like to be alone 
awereness fell on me
my bones my bones
i felt my ribs
my bones my bones 
i'm mud i'm mudheld up 
if it breaks i'm done
i had to be brave
you gotta be brave 
i had to be brave 
you gotta be brave 
i had to be brave 
you gotta be 
don't seem like no choice to me
