Chorus:
Dub-i-dub-i-dub-i-dub-dub-dub
Dub-i-dub-i-dub-i-yeah-yeah
Dub-i-dub-i-dub-i-dub-dub-dub
I don't need your love
Dub-i-dub-i-dub-i-dub-dub-dub
Dub-i-dub-i-dub-i-yeah-yeah
Dub-i-dub-i-dub-i-dub-dub-dub
I don't need your love anymore

I don't need you here by my side
No more, no no
And when I feel your love deep inside
I will forget, oh yeah
So don't you dare come knocking on my door
When you need someone to hold
'Cause every door and window is closed
I can live, live without your love

Chorus

You left me, you went away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And now you say you're back to stay
No way, no way
So don't you dare come knocking on my door
When you need someone to hold
'Cause every door and window is closed
I can live, live without your love

Chorus

Love is cold, yeah
I don't need your
Love is cold, yeah

Chorus
