Written By N. Finn & T. Finn

Walking 'round the room singing
Stormy Weather
at 57 Mt. Pleasant St.
Well it's the same room but everything's different
You can fight the sleep but not the dream
Things ain't cooking in my kitchen
Strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire
Couldn't conquer the blue sky
Well there's a small boat made of china
Is going nowhere on the mantlepiece
Well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard
Or do I sing like a bird released

CHORUS
Everywhere you go you always take the weather with you

(Repeat)
