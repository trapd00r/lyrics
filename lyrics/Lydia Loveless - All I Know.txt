[Verse]
Well, how many times have I lied awake at night
Wishing you were here to start a fight?
I get so lonely sometimes
I feel half alive
And when did I become this boring and down?
Everyone says - why are you so down in the dumps
This is a beautiful place and you will have fun

[Chorus]
But your lips are so soft and sweet
Oh, I miss your company
You’re the only one to see
That the sun ain’t gonna rise by itself
Honey, I don’t care if you can’t hold my hand
And all you’ll ever be is a real good friend
I don’t care if you can’t be my man
All I know is that I’m going to see you again
All I know is that I’m going to be with you again

[Verse]
Well, how many times did I think if I just went away
And put some distance between us everything would be okay
But I was nine hours on a plane, and I feel exactly the same
Well, I’ve been asking myself how long can this crap go on
And blaming you for everything that ever went wrong between you and me
That was my fault
Should never have told you that I'm gone

[Chorus]
‘Cause your lips are so soft and wet
Ever since we kissed
I can feel you in my chest
I’ve got you under my skin like hardening cement
I don’t care if you can’t hold my hand
And all you’ll be is just a real good friend
I don’t care if you can’t be my man
All I know is that I’m going to see you again
All I know is that I’m going to be with you again

[Chorus]
Your lips are so soft and wet
Well, ever since we kissed
I’ve got you under my skin

[Verse]
How many times have I lied awake at night
Wishing I could just get you off of my mind
I know I haven’t even tried
I guess it’s going to take some time

[Chorus]
I don’t care if you can’t hold my hand
And all you’ll ever be is just a real good friend
I don’t care if you can’t be my man
All I know is that I’m going to see you

And I don’t care if you can’t be my man
Honey, I don’t want you to be my boyfriend, no

All I know is that I’m going to see you again
All I know is that I’m going to be with you again
All I know is that I’m going to be with you again
