Hold me like the way that you said
Not like you were holding another
Take me to the foot of your bed
And we will find our way over in the morning
Find our way over in the morning

Remember when I said I was sorry?
Remember when I made you cry?
Remember when the lights went out?
We were looking for a little bit of blue sky
Looking for a little bit of blue sky

Hold me like the way that you said
Not like you were holding another
Take me to the foot of your bed
And we will find our way over in the morning
Find our way over in the morning

Not a stolen moment passes
Not a day goes creeping by
Watch the world behind dark glasses
Looking for a little bit of blue sky
Looking for a little bit of blue sky

All my friends are looking thinner
All my friends got an axe to grind
Making music with the sinners
and looking for a blue sky
Looking for a blue sky

Hold me like the way that you said
Not like you were holding another
Take me to the foot of your bed
And we will find our way over in the morning
Find our way over in the morning
Find our way over in the morning
