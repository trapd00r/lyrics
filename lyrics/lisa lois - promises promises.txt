Did you say you would stay forever (Promises Promises)
Did I dream or did you mean forever (Promises Promises)
Your clothes are bad and your hair is a mess, forget you
I don't have to stay untested but I do

Time after time
It's the same old lies you keep saying, saying, saying, saying

You love me there'll never be another (Promises Promises)
But my oh my look what I discovered (Promises Promises)
I saw you somewhere you should not be, with someone
I looked and it was not me, now come on?

I'm not so naïve
And I want to belief you're not playing, playing, playing, playing

Lies, lies, lies, lies
It's so sad to watch you improvise
Heard it all before, don't wanna hear no more
I'm not staying, staying, staying, staying

I tell me friends it's the end forever
I'm forgetting you
I swear it's true forever (Promises Promises)

I caught you somewhere you should not be, with someone
I looked and it was not me, now come on?

I'm not so naïve
And I want to belief you're not playing, playing, playing, playing

(Promises Promises)
