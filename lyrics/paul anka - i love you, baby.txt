As I walk by the seaside
As I walk through the grass
I see little bluebirds
Making love while I pass
Bees are hummin' and they're singin' everywhere
Everyone's in love

Oh oh
I love you baby, I love you so
I need you honey, I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my heart
You're the one I adore
And I-I I love you

As I walk by the schoolyard
As I walk by the gate
I see the weeping willow
Where we kissed on every date
And carved in the bark
You'll find an arrow and a heart
And underneath it says

Oh oh
I love you baby, I love you so
I need you honey, I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my heart
You're the one I adore
And I-I I love you

(Instrumental Interlude)

As I walk to the corner
And I pass the candy store
I hear the very music
That I once heard before
Oh how you held me as the music softly played
I was so in love

Oh oh
I love you baby, I love you so
I need you honey, I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my heart
You're the one I adore
And I-I I love you
I-I I love you
I-I I love you
