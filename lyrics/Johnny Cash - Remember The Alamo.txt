A hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die 
By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was high 
Any man that will fight to the death cross over 
But if you want to live you'd better fly 
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine 
Hey Santa Anna we're killing your soldiers below 
That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo 
Ol' Bowie lay dying his powder was ready and dry 
Flat on his back Bowie killed them a few in reply 
And young Davy Crockett was singing and laughing with gallantry fears in his eyes 
For God and for freedom a man more than willing to die 
Hey Santa Anna... 
They sent a young scout from the battlements bloody and loud 
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud 
Grieve not little darling my dying if Texas is sovereign and free 
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be 
Hey Santa Anna...
