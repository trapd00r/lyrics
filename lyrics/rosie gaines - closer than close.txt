Let's get close closer than close
closer than you could ever imagine us
Let's get close closer than close
closer than you could ever imagine us
 
All week long   I've been waiting
Every night I've been alone Holding on
Dreams of you   keep me alive
This time, no, I'm never gonna' let you go
 
Let's get close closer than close
closer than you could ever imagine us
 
Open my mystery... you're the one who has the key
Bring that magical paradise
Never fails that you inspire   uncontrollable desire
 
Let's get close closer than close
closer than you could ever imagine us
 
Close the door... turn out the lights
Turn me on with magical music... hypnotize
Lover man... so glad you're here
Whispering our secret language in my ear
 
Open my mystery... you're the one who has the key
Bring that magical paradise
Never fails that you inspire   uncontrollable desire
 
Let's get close closer than close
closer than you could ever imagine us
 
When you're near, nothing is wrong
forgetting all about the day... all night long
You turn me on... with your heart
Baby don't you know... we'll never part
 
Let's get close closer than close
closer than you could ever imagine us
 
Let's get close closer than close
closer than you could ever imagine us
