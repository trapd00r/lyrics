So I heard the rumors saying that you left me
For another dime, that's fine
Every now and then I think about the memories
Was a little blind inside
Now you got me stopin'
Re-considering options
Like the way I sound
You got me admittin'
Hell of a good rhythm
All the times we'd fight?

Nothing last forever and it's fine
Oo-hoo, it's life
Say you're never ever satisfied
Oo-hoo, it's life
Nothing lasts forever and it's fine
Oo-hoo, it's life, oo-hoo, it's life

Think about the memories that we shared
All of the fights here and there
Running barefoot on the street
You chasing me - I chase you back and then we're free
Bet a million on a makeup, then another break up
Then I say, "why not to go back to your place?
'Cause I don't want you around, anymore, no, oh"

Nothing last forever and it's fine
Oo-hoo, it's life
Say you're never satisfied
Oo-hoo, it's life
Nothing last forever and it's fine
Oo-hoo, it's life, oo-hoo, it's life
...

Nothing last forever and it's fine
Oo-hoo, it's life
Say you're never satisfied
Oo-hoo, it's life
Nothing last forever and it's fine
Oo-hoo, it's life
Say you're never satisfied
Oo-hoo, it's life
Nothing last forever and it's fine
Oo-hoo, it's life

Oo-hoo, it's life
Oo-hoo, it's life
Oo-hoo, it's life
Oo-hoo, it's life
