(It's breaking me down)
A-a-ah
A-a-ah
Boy check this out
Before we get it on
You gotta know
I've got my doubts
But wait, don't get me wrong (no, no)
I like your style
You know you rock my world
It's just that you
You drive me wild
I'm going crazy boy

~~Your love is kryptonie (a-a-ah)
It's breakin' me down
Explode like dynamite (a-a-ah)
When I hit the ground~~
Oh can't you see
It's clear to me
Your love has got me down on my knees
Oh baby please
But I still come around

I'm blown away
By everything you do
Just hear me out
All I can say
Emotions feel brand new

I lost control
The situation's worse
I'm getting weak
It's like my soul is tortured by this curse

~~Your love is kryptonite (a-a-ah)
It's breaking me down
Explode like dynamite (a-a-ah)
When I hit the ground~~
N-I-T-E, let your love explode on me
N-I-T-E, let your love explode on me
