I wanna know where you belong
I wanna know why I sing this song
I tried to show how much I feel
Is that a dream or is it real?

I never look where you belong
Until i gotta sing my song
Is it a lie or is it true?
So many tears I've cried for you

Woh ohh, a million tears for you
Wooho ohh, a million tears for you
Ohh, a million tears for you
Wooho ohh, a million tears for you

A million tears that I have cried
I wish you were right by my side
I tried to show how much I care
Beleive in me I will be there

I never knew where you belong
Whenever you just hear my song
Is it a lie or is it true?
So many tears I've cried for you

Wooho ohh, a million tears for you
Wooho ohh, a million tears for you-ou-ou-ou...
