(Some guy)
If one does what God does enough times, he becomes as God is
If you put it together, you get what you wanted
What you desired, if you do it enough times
He believes, you become one who is desired, and wanted, and accepted
Because God has Power
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is

(Vinnie Paz)
Yeah Jedi Mind Baby
Yeah

Yeah we bringin' you the hardcore, the real raw type shit
You ain't never seen nothing before like this
It's all real, all ill, and all natural
We all kill, all still, an blast at you
I like blood, I like tasting ya flesh
I like slugs, I like David Keresh
I like anything that's related to death
I like any king that can reign with his fist
Now back to the topic at hand
Steadily Shine, Shine Steadily with my fam
I'm the one who put the nail in the cross
I'm the one who told the world about an alien corpse
I'm the one who brought the truth to the light
If you listening to me you couldn't lose in a fight
Abusing the mic, with the force of five lions
Anybody fuckin' with Paz can die trying

(Vinnie Paz)
I'm a caged lion, always dying to hurt you
Always a believer that my rhymings a virtue
You just a heathen, and you lie like the church do
I can't believe that Allah hasn't cursed you
You too commercial, you still a disgrace
You like to sit around with women watching Will and Grace
I can't over-stand your sweetness
You should try hire a therapist to beat this
I'm being facetious, you should heat this
I'm the one who hammered the first nail in Jesus
I'm the definition of Toxic
Anyone who ever got close to me got sick

(Vinnie Paz)
We like heavy metal, listening to Sepultura
Remain calm, study Islam, and read Torahs
You can't fallow the paths of Man's Hill
You can't study the math and can't ill
You can't over-stand what I believe
You drown in an ocean of God and can't breath
It's like I've been involved with beef
Since the days that I lost my teeth ??
I learn how to worship Allah
I learn how to rhyme, and I teach it to y'all
I'm speakin' to y'all
Its hardcore, real rap
Real Slugs, Real Clips and Real Gats
You real wack, and that's how I feel
And that's the reason that I got a reason to kill

Yeah... fallow me daddy
Jedi Mind
What's the fuckin' deal
