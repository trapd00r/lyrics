Give me release, witness me
I am outside, give me peace

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that
I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

Passion, choke the flower
Till she cries no more
Possessing all beauty
Hungry still for more

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that
I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

I can't help this longing
Comfort me
I can't hold it all in
If you won't let me

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that
I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

In this white wave, I am sinking
In this silence
In this white wave, in this silence
I believe

In this white wave, I am sinking
In this silence
In this white wave, in this silence
I believe

I have seen you in this white wave
You are silent
You are breathing in this white wave
I am free
