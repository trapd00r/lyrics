What a lazy aftermath
She still talks to vampires

Attractive as a game show
Pacing at a coffee machine
Busted on a slippery floor
Trapped in a revolving door

Shrink the room
Darker and drape
Although you know
How do you escape?

And traffic citations
From a speedy trap
And everything you say
Goes against you

A convoluted solution
Blurring the contacts
