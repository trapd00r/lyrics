I've been most unwilling to see this turmoil of mine 
The thought of sitting with this has me paralyzed 

With this prolonged exposure to mirror and averted eyes 
Iâ€˜ve feigned that I've been waiting: such mileage for empathizing 

and now I see the madness in me is brought out in the presence of you 
now I know the madness lives on when you're not in the room 
and though I'd love to blame you for all, I'd miss these moments of opportune 
you've simply brought this madness to light and I should thank you 
oh thank you, much thanks for this bird's eye view 
oh thank you for your most generous triggers 

It's been all too easy to cross my arms and roll my eyes 
The thought of dropping all arms leaves me terrified 

and now I see the madness in me is brought out in the presence of you 
now I know the madness lives on when you're not in the room 
and though I'd love to blame you for all, I'd miss these moments of opportune 
you've simply brought this madness to light and I should thank you 
oh thank you, much thanks for this bird's eye view 
oh thank you for your most generous triggers

I'd have to give up knowing and give up being right 
You inadvertent hero, you angel in disguise 

and now I see the madness in me is brought out in the presence of you 
now I know the madness lives on when you're not in the room 
and though I'd love to blame you for all, I'd miss these moments of opportune 
you've simply brought this madness to light and I should thank you 
oh thank you, much thanks for this bird's eye view 
oh thank you for your most generous triggers.
