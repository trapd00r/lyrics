E-boy the B-boy the one you can't avoid
On the 10 o'clock news and on the tabloids
Still rockin' that good old crunchy funk
A with a hi-hat boogie and a bass thata bump
And with a beat like this to make it all crisp
We hit you with a style, u know you can't resist
So get on the floor come get some more
We catch you on the go and I know that you know
On the wheels of steel my man DJ Gis
Baptizing the beat on a top of the list
Breakin' on the curves, slidin' with the ride
Blazin' that tune - aimin' up high
Now feel the flow surfin' through ur bones
Guarantee to give ur groove more bounce to the ounce
Now could it be the bass that we got you all amazed
Or is it just fresh 'cause ur rockin' with the best

Rock rock - rockin' with the best

Jammin' to the feel now this track's for real
U BURN dem SNEAKERS like a psycho bill
Wicked on the cut so give ur best shot
Smooth with the lick just to move ur butt
Kool like that so we make ur hands clap
Rollin' with the rhythm or you get ur money back
'Cause if it ain't the funk you know it ain't the bomb
Stuff we deliver can't do no harm
So MC's if ya feelin' me, DJ's on the wheels of steel
Rockin' crowds with the harmony
Keepin' the vibe alive, well and free
Badd with the boogie 'cause we found the effect
Hot boom bap guaranteed to get ya wrecked
Filled with the goods so you get no rest
Or could it be it's fresh 'cause ya rockin' with the best

Rock rock - rockin' with the best

Ba... ba... bass
Phat, phat, phat bass

On the way to the end, we must comprehend
Why we still represent to the full extend
With the rhymes that I bust I make ya curious
If ya really feel the lust or just delirious
'Cause when we push ruff you know it's pure cut
Raw with the groove - easy to turn it up
We keep it sharp on the edge with a nuff niceness
Or could it be it's fresh - 'cause ya rockin' with the best
