Won't pretend I know
Every last little thing
About you
Can't defend myself
Yes its true I care
But then I doubt you

Not living it up
Not living it up while I'm away
But you never ever wanna let me live it down when I come home
Not giving you up
Not giving it up now there's no way
But you gotta let me hang on to something honey

Show me Naomi (show me show me)
Show me every last little thing about you (show me)
If you don't show me how you wanna be treated
Ah history just gets repeated
So you gotta
Show me Naomi

Hard to find trust
If the two of us
Aren't even trying
Can't define us
Though we must still
Be relying

Not living it up
Not living it up while I'm away
But you never ever wanna let me live it down when I come home
Not giving you up
Not giving it up now there's no way
Though I know that sometimes yes you'd rather be alone

Show me Naomi (show me show me)
Show me every last little thing about you (show me)
If you don't show me how you wanna be treated
Ah history just gets repeated
So you gotta
Show me Naomi
