Mallorca, extasy and motion, oh oh oh 
That's Mallorca 
Mallorca, give me your devotion, oh oh oh 
That's Mallorca 
Living is easy, life will be so crazy 
I don't wanna miss it no more 
Come on down and get it 
Your mind can really take it 
That's the way you like it for sure 

Mallorca, join the generation, oh oh oh 
That's Mallorca 
Mallorca, feel the good vibration, oh oh oh 
That's Mallorca 

Hey with my feeling nice, and my feeling nice like our
Hey we could make it deep in the cool water 
Hey with my feeling nice, and my feeling nice like our 
Come on and take a break 
Come take a break and release the pressure 
Hey you, whenever you wanna be 
Where the sun is out and you're feeling free 
Hey you whatcha gonna do 
If you're feeling sad or if you're feeling blue 
One, two I need my dancing shoe 
I need a party and so do you 


Three, four I'm out on the dancefloor 
Mallorca is the place for sure 

Come, come follow me 
Come, come, hit it, hit it ! 


Hey I'm feeling nice, I'm feeling nice like a... 
Hey make a way straight to the air, music and time 
Hey I'm feeling nice, I'm feeling nice like a... 
Come on and take a break 
Come take a break and go Mallorca 
Hey you, wherever you wanna be 
Where the sun is out and you're feeling free 
Hey you whatcha gonna do 
If you're feeling sad or if you're feeling blue 
Five, six Soulman in the mix 
Everyone does so you're on the race 
Seven or eight we're gonna set things straight 
I got a date and I won't be late 

That's Mallorca 
Oh Mallorca! 
That's Mallorca 
Extasy and motion
