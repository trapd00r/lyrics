Oh boy it's over you got me
You shot me right between the eyes
I'm sober, I'm over the haze of never knowing
If I can still feel what is real
Will someone punch me out

And oh boy I know boy
I need a breakdown
Can you crush me

In the palm of your hand
The palm of your hand
There's nobody else who can
You know you crush me
In the palm of your hand

Oh boy you wake me and shake me
I'll break the bullet in my hand
I attack but you fight back
The redder the love the better
You make it all ache
I'm breathing, I'm breathing life again

And oh boy I know boy I need a breakdown
Can you crush me

In the palm of your hand
The palm of your hand
There's nobody else who can
You know you crush me
In the palm of your hand
The palm of your hand
There's nobody else who can
You know you crush me
In the palm of your hand

You make me want to be a human again
Can I be your only human again
You bring me back
You bring me back in pieces in the

Palm of your hand
The palm of your hand
There's nobody else who can
You know you crush me
In the palm of your hand
The palm of your hand
There's nobody else who can
You know you crush me crush me
In the palm of your hand
