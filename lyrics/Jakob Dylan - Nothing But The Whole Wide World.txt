Nothing but the whole wide world to gain
nothing, nothing
Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain
nothing, nothing
Got nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world to gain

I'm here on the blacktop
The sun in my eyes
Women and country on my mind
Bolting me out
Over the borderline

Now there's no more love loss and no more shame
No more digging holes or graves
Nothing to lose but rivets and chains
Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain

Nothing but the whole wide world to gain
nothing, nothing
Got nothing but the whole wide world to gain
nothing, nothing
Got nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world to gain

Was born in a stable and built like an ox
Down in the pastures I learned how to walk
Mama, she raised me to sing and just let 'em talk
Said no rich man's worth his weight in dust
Bury him down same as they'll do us
God wants us busy, never giving up
He wants nothing but the whole wide world for us

Nothing but the whole wide world for us
nothing, nothing
Well there's nothing but the whole wide world for us
nothing, nothing
Well there's nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world for us

We ain't got no money, can't get no love
Never was too good at either of 'em
I'm here for adventure whichever way it comes
But what good is an angel that won't catch up
Free falling now and I'm ready enough
I give my tears and I give my blood
I give nothing but the whole wide world for one

Nothing but the whole wide world for one
nothing, nothing
Give nothing but the whole wide world for one
nothing, nothing
Give nothing but the whole wide, whole wide world for one
