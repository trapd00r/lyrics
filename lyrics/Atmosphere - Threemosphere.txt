No, don't do that
You might hurt somebody

No, don't do that
They don't deserve that
Look at 'em they couldn't handle it they nerves'll collapse
drag 'em up sip em up, skinny boy rip the cut no excuses needed
This ones wack that one sucks
Don't even front like you got close to balls inside
Your egos in planted personified
Everybody wanna score aimin' at an all time high
Shootin' at the stars tryin' to make them fall out the sky

the gray matter blade runner screamin' thoughts of anger
At the world from beneath this rock I stay under
tonight's rain and thunder was brought to you in part
By that same fucker that put the fear of the atlas in your heart now

Guess where I'm standin' (where?) over the head
If you put a hand up you can fondle everything I said
And if I lose my patience sombody's losin' they limbs
And gettin' left in this basement with the rest of these gimps

Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear (come on, come on)
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear

Don't touch yourself and keep your muff in your belt
Who the fuck you think holds the controls over what you felt
You need way too much help, take a seat on the bench
Gonna teach you how to make sense while I make my rent

If you reach the fence without kickin' the landmine
You get a piece of my mind and the number to my fan line
no wonder you're wack
most of mankind is wack
can't nobody read the sign that says there ain't no turning back

Steppin' the at, you better be prepared to have a hobby to do
but wen we blowin' your career so get a copy of the papers
That you think gave you the right to even come within 100 yards of this spot

But here I am breath deep count to ten
Keep the beat locate the loose screws so I can pound 'em in
It all spread news get news city to city
I ain't mad at none of y'all 'cause can't none of y'all fuck wit' me

Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear (come on, come on)
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear (yeah, ha ha)
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear

I'm on the poverty tour with J-Bird my man
Kickin' every raw soul across this desolate land
as it meets the expectations, it gets broken and cornered
tryin to strangle the stupidity and choke its supporters

from this day forward, I'll be the voice that u wait for
the one that u pay for and the one that u hate more
wheteher u drive a ford, a tugboat, or a skateboard
put my tape on open up and face forward

cuz wen we land anywhere near the mic stand
we get u pleasin with the meaning of your life span
motivation u been watin for to make a tight plan
gotcha like i think that i can yes i think that i can

well go ahead take a sip, introduce us to yourself
place us on ur list of influences im a live for ever
fuck bein rich for seven years
hello im slug and my crew is called...

Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear
Atmosphere, don't front like you can't hear
