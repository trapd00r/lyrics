I am near you
You don't see me
Can you feel me?
I'm closer than close
Does it hurt? Does it burn?
Do you know, what you've lost?
Are you scared, of the dark?

Now that you're gone
All that remains
Is the ghost of love
Deep in my mind
I hear the chains
Of the ghost of love

Here I've fallen
Down and dirty
You'll be crawling
Lower than low
Can you sleep, can you breathe
When you know, what you've done?
Tell me where, will you run?

Now that you're gone
All that remains
Is the ghost of love
Deep in my mind
I hear the chains
Of the ghost of love

You are flawless
Cruel and thoughtless
And all that you left of me is
The ghost of love

I'm fading 
I'm barely breathing
Can't hold on
I'm dying, I must be bleeding
Won't be long

Now that you're gone
All that remains
Is the ghost of love
Deep in my mind
I hear the chains
Of the ghost of love
