Ooh, my love
The first time that you spoke my name
It somehow sounded not the same
Was like I knew from that moment on
That this is what I'm living for
Fate had opened up the door
And who am I to say that heaven could be wrong

If it's all I ever do
I would give my heart to you
And I will do it faithfully
Until the end of time
When they carve my name in stone
At least I know they'll know
That in this life I've made mistakes
That I did one thing right
Cause I will spend forever loving you
If it's all I ever do, my love

Baby when I look at you
Standing there so pure and true
I don't know what I did to deserve
The way you smile
The way we touch
The way you kiss, it mean so much
I must be the luckiest man
In the whole wide world

If it's all I ever do
I would give my heart to you
And I will do it faithfully
Until the end of time
When they carve my name in stone
At least I know they'll know
That in this life I've made mistakes
That I did one thing right
Cause I will spend forever loving you
If it's all I ever do

And you'd do anything on earth for me
And it makes me love you more
Cause baby, you're the only love I need

If it's all I ever do
I would give my heart to you
And I will do it faithfully
Until the end of time
When they carve my name in stone
At least I know they'll know
That in this life I've made mistakes
That I did one thing right
Cause I will spend forever loving you
Yes I will
Cause I will spend forever loving you
If it's all I ever do, my love
