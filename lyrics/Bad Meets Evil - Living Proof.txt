(Intro: Royce da 5'9")
Yeah, Bad and Evil is (back)
(Don't stop)

(Verse 1: Royce da 5'9")
We bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
'01's the year where I fell from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin', my career is gone into re-callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was speedballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall doubled back and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realised that God's with us as soon as I decided
To put that bottle down and pick up my Todd Bridges
The writing's on the wall
Since niggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls like "I'm just checking on you dog"
While I just throw up this message on the stall...

(Hook: Royce da 5'9")
When them bottles stop poppin' and them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and don't stop
I made a promise to my momma, I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop
I'm living proof nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
It's the Worldwide American way, I'm living proof nigga

(Verse 2: Eminem)
Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
You just gone sit there and take it or make 'em suck it
Tell 'em where to shove it straight up
You gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass, did ya piss ants whoop me
Will be the day I say I ate poop, shit, the day that
I don't straight shoot, I'll drop outta my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back
And put it on straight loop, you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon got my swagger back
I was dragging, hop back on it, grab the reigns on that bastard
And came back on 'em without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
'Cause I'll be screaming on these whores till I'm hoarse!

(Veres 3: Royce Da 5' 9")
Nah I ain't fading yet, I'd rather stay and rep, I mighta made a dent
But I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next
So I don't stay in debt me broke, you might as well cut the embryo
Out my momma and play catch
With the baby with AKs with baby bayonets
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
That's why its either kill or be killed, so call me suicide homocide Ryan

(Verse 4: Eminem)
There's a bomb inside my head, I'm a live wire
I am on the edge, teetering on it like I tore the iron mic
Get on a nut like a tyre iron, I have no desire stopping
So why would I drop and roll, that's how much on fire I am
Rappers are fun and I'm the time 'cause I'm just flying by 'em
Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up
So it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up
