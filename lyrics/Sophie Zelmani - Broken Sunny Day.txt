Old gone days
Got as new today
Like I wouldn't have known

I count the years
Now to seconds
Like I wouldn't have known

What I dropped on my track
I can now feel on my back
Like I wouldn't have known

Old cured ways
Fell into happy today
Like I wouldn't have known

This is a sunny broken day
This is a broken sunny day

I found the place where they'd rest
But some memories won't settle
With the past
Like I wouldn't have known

What was once my excuse
Must be the same again I'll use
Like I still wouldn't know

This is a sunny broken day
This is a broken sunny day
This is a sunny broken day
This is a broken sunny day
