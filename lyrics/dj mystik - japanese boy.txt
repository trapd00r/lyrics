Angel don't cry
Angel don't cry
Angel don't cry
Angel don't cry
Angel don't cry
Angel don't cry

What can I do to help an angel
What can you say if he's forgoten about you
Heaven no longer want this angel
Crying your blue tears as your falling from the sky
Cause i'll be there for you boy
I will see you through boy

Angel don't cry
Because i'll be your blue angel
Angel don't cry
You now how much i care
Angel don't cry
Because i'll be your blue angel
Angel don't cry

I'll send you a message of salvation
Did you come to earth to set our spirits free?
Maybe your a gift from heaven
Show me there is an angel here inside of me
spread your wings boy
theres no need to cry boy
spread your wings boy
theres no need to cry boy

Angel don't cry
Because i'll be your blue angel
Angel don't cry
You now how much i care
Angel don't cry
Because i'll be your blue angel
Angel don't cry
