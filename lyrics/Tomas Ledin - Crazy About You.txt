Don't touch that dial it's partytime my favourite station's on and I love life
Don't touch that dial it's partytime You've top priorities' right
Let's have a real good time tonight

Something is crazy you're disturbing the peace
Some... are screaming hear that music...
But all I can say is come join us have fun
Lets deepen depression all on the run

Don't touch that dial it's partytime my favourite station's on and I love life
Don't touch that dial it's partytime You've top priorities' right
Let's have a real good time tonight

Maybe you're lonely she's found somebody new
Maybe your're low have no work nothing to do
But look at the bright side the things can be done
Lets deepen depression all on the run

D.d.d. don't touch that dial it's partytime my favourite station's on and I love life
Don't touch that dial it's partytime You've top priorities' right
Let's have a real good time tonight

I wanna fall in love, I wanna dance all night
I wanna rather sit on your...
And I want it tonight

Don't touch that dial
Don't touch that dial it's partytime
Don't touch that dial it's partytime my favourite station's on and I love life
Don't touch that dial it's partytime You're top priorities' right
