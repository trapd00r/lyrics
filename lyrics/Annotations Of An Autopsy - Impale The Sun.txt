A holy icon
Shining down, spreading dogma
Its rays suffocate me
Blistering the skin of my effigy

A blinding icon
Burns our eyes, branding our minds
Its rays burn through my skin
Exposing the demon within

Its glowing rays burn into our eyes
Creating a divine state of control
Flooding our minds with holy propaganda
Closing our eyes to a world of lies

Branded by the holy flame
Fooled by the trinity
The rancid flesh that cages my true form
Is slowly falling from me
Revealing my true face
Humanity will now witness 
As I plunge this world into suffocating darkness

Rise, as the halo of the slave earth shatters
Appointed leaders lay cold and blue
Worshippers drag the swamps searching for a martyr

Step into the void, embrace my emptiness
Everything you worshipped
Now crowned in shit

Branded by the holy flame
Fooled by the trinity
The rancid flesh that cages my true form
Is slowly falling from me
Revealing my true face
For the whole world to see
In order to free our minds
We must impale the sun

The age of the church is dead
When the sun falls, darkness will rise
Humanity will witnesss the dawn of a new kingdom
As we step into
The age of enslavement
