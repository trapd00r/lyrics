A fire needs a space to burn, a breath to build a glow
I've heard it said a thousand times, but now I know

That you don't know what you've got 
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

I thought I kept you safe and sound, I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize that I was wrong
'Cause finding what you've got sometimes means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light when I let go

'Cause you don't know what you've got till it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
It's your battle to be fought
No you don't know what you've got till it's gone

Till it's gone
Till it's gone
