I represent the H at the bottom of the map
And I was born & raised in the bottom of the trap
The number 1 rule is you gotta stay straped
'Cause any givin' minute you can take that long nap
I roll with gorillas, dealers & the killers
'Cause when I'm on stage that's the only fool spillers
Real Trill niggas, let me see your hands
But I do this for the streets, I ain't tryin' to make you dance
Roll so low, I don't need no friends
Still flip that lac, I don't need no Benz
And Harlem throwin' money, I don't need no Zen's
Matter fact I be back, I need more to spend
She say she wanna...

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.

It's white-T, Nikes, when I hit the club
They say I can't get in 'cause I'm dressed like a Thug
Fuck the dress code (fuck 'em) we 'about a hundred deep
And they gon' let it seen, or get they ass beat
Boss Hogg Outlaws roll like the mob
Everybody paid 'cause we stays on our job
Drop in GT a blessin' from the Lord
So haters don't be mad that we blame it on god
I'm comin' out hard, them other boys soft
So I'm a hold it down for that H & the Nawf
Brand new jewelry look what I brought
Still runnin' from the feds, I ain't never gettin' caught
She say she wanna...

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
Thug from around the way.
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.

You say your man ain't fuckin' you right
Your lonely & depression need a Thug in your life
Well come on over here, I can feel your appetite
Take you back to the crib & beat it all night
She say she love a Thug 'cause Thugga beat it good
Her man pay them bills, but Thugga keep it hood
And I ain't gotta stare, that's already understood
I take you for a ride, you can slide on my wood
I pick her up & shake her up & down like dice
Sweet like cake make me wanna take a slice
I ain't tryin' to take advantage, but take my advice
Take a break from the fakes, get a Thug in your life
She say she wanna...

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug.
