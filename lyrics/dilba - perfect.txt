I love it, when you blush

oo shy to look me straight in the eyes

nd you are blessed with the worlds sweetest smile

 dont want to do wrong, but I cant hide



arling I, sometimes forget

nd then I do things I regret

ill do right and only my best

ut Im not perfect 


ts like a hug, you know when, its been held on "a bit to long"

ts like that kiss , that Im sure you dreamed of

t is all my best wishes gathered in this song

ts about thinking right and doing wrong



hen I smile, though I feel like crying

ts not the time , I say, though I know Im lying

ish I could hold you but I cant stand being held 


 really do my best and only my best

ut Im not perfect
