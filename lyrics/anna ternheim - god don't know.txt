In his arms I forget
The beautiful women he met
Behind my back
His eyes stay true
Even loving you

God knows, God don't know
God don't know

I begged him to leave you
Saying that together we'll be free
He comes home late
All scratched up
Oh my minds fucked up
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
God knows, God don't know
God don't know

I even thought I could get out
Walk away, put my head right
He wakes up with a mouth too sweet
He still makes me bleed

God knows, God don't know
God knows, God don't know
God knows, God don't know
God don't know, God don't know
