Lyrics
I'm A Leave A Nigga Dead In The Streets, {Streets}
So Let The Word Get Around, I'm A Lay A Nigga Down
If He Ever Think He Better Than Me
See They Can Never Compete
A Heat Seeker, Infa Red Creeper, Real Blood Leaker,
Coming Through Your Speaker Listen Up Close Cause It's About To Get Deeper
About 6 Feet I Gotta Sleeper With The Reaper
9 Milimeter Go Bang Bang Ba Da Da Dang Ba Da Da Dar Dang
Watch A Little Nigga Do His Thang, Thang, He Do His Thang, You Know I Do My Thang
I'm A Rep For The God Father
