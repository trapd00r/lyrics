Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Broken promises 
My heart you stole, lies you told
Got the best of me
Digging in my heart of gold
Used to look at you
And see the possibilities
I see you for who you are
Boy you've disappointed me

I thought you gave me love
Was never near enough
Soon enough time reveals
Love wait of what is real
Know all I need to know
But see you got to go
What have you given me
But lies lies

Go ahead, go on and get up out of here
Go ahead baby
You knew you was wrong
You knew all along
Must be crazy
If you think I'ma fall for this anymore
Everybody say no no no no no
Everybody say no no no no no

Used to believe in every word you said
Clouds my head
Leaving me here to drown
Hopes and dreams, therefore dead
You point your finger
Trying to justify your mistakes
Our days is goin' to be made
So you best be on your way

I thought you gave me love
Was never near enough
Soon enough time reveals
Love wait of what is real
Know all I need to know
But see you got to go
What have you given me
But lies lies

Go ahead, go on and get up out of here
Go ahead baby
You knew you was wrong
You knew all along
Must be crazy
If you think I'ma fall for this anymore
Everybody say no no no no no
Everybody say no no no no no

No need to apologize
Don't try to make it right
I know I should've known betta
When you took hold, I was sold
Using fear to control, now it unfolds
Let me tell you right now what I'm gonna do
I made up my mind
It's time and I'm through with you
Nothing you can say or can do
Can make me change me mind

Go ahead, go on and get up out of here
Go ahead baby
You knew you was wrong
You knew all along
Must be crazy
If you think I'ma fall for this anymore
Everybody say no no no no no
Everybody say no no no no no

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
