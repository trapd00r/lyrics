Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess, quite a mess

Someone convinced me of jealousy
It's the best compliment I'll ever get
So I shouldn't be the sad girl
shouldn't but I said I was
And who's going to tell
who's going to tell this time?

It's a blizzard outside
Don't you dare stay inside

Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess, quite a mess

And what of the light boxing in the back
Why do I fear the poison I spread out
There's no need to swing back coasters, the bottle display
And who's going to fail,
Who's going to fail this time

It's a blizzard outside
Don't you dare stay inside

Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess, quite a mess

It's a blizzard outside
Don't you dare stay inside
It's a blizzard outside
Don't you dare stay inside

Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
Quite a feeling, quite a relief, quite a mess
