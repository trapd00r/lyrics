The things we have
In common are
Feelings we repress
I find you in the darkness
Where lightness means less

Times when we're
In need of touching
Are when tears
Could get there before
We are walking with pain
When we've seen
People we adore

The things we're
Calling secrets
Are usually the way in
We go to sleep
With the knowledge
That each mind has sins

Times when we are lifted
The fall feels so high
We cry over beauty
It hurts to smile

My way is your way
Your way is mine
My way is your way
Your way is mine
