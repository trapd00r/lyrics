Six o'clock in the morning wipe the sleep from my eyes (yeah).
Felt just like an ordinary day. Just around the corner such a surprise,
a beautiful angel materialised. Time stood still, face to face. I'm
sure we'd met in another time and place (met in another time and place)

Our eyes met as you passed me by (passed me by).
Two souls intwined in the blink of an eye (yeah). And i had to figure
out what i'd be missing.
So i turned to you and asked you if you wanted to.
(you know we'll be getting some getting jiggy just for fun.)

(Chorus)
Rendesvouz where to my place, say 2 &  we can do anything you wanna do.
Hey, tonight is your night yeah. When you close your eyes,
take a minute, take a moment, realise.
Do you see me when you fantasise. tonight'll be your night.

I'm just sitting here  daydreaming about you and all the things you do.
Girl feels so right. And all i know is you're the one for me,
that special kinda' lady.
In my life in my life.

Well here i am writing you a love song. Holding back those years,
it's been so long.
and i can't deny the way that i'm feeling (feeling).
It's true, so girl thats why i'm asking you, can we...

(Chorus)

Darling tell me, what's on your mind? What you thinking?
Hey what you thinking? Hey what you thinking?
Darling tell me what's on your mind?
What's on your mind yeah? Darling what are you thinking?
Now darling what are you thinking?

(Chorus)

I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you and all the things you do.
Girl feels so right. And all i know is you're the one for me,
