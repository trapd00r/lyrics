If I tried to abuse you. if I did you wrong. 
If I ever accused you for stealing my songs. 
If I lightly disturbed you with my unfaithful laws. 
If it slightly occurred to you that I wasn't yours. 

Then excuse me for being this mad, 
But it's all in my head 
And I get nothing done as the sun moves up and down ... without you. 

If you ever did see me on somebody else's arm. 
If I told you to believe me when I lied like a charm. 

Then excuse me for being this mad,
But it's all in my head 
And I get nothing done as the sun moves up and down - without you. 

If I lied, if I talked, 
If I hit you in the dark, if I swore to never leave and then let you fall apart. 

If my thoughts were too qeer, 
If I could have been there, 
If I pushed you around, 
Then I excuse myself now...

If I lied, if I talked, 
If I hit you in the dark, if I swore to never leave and then let you fall apart.
