Over the ocean
Up in the sky 
All around me
Gotta be right
You are the reason
I'm losing it all
Tell me the meaning
Or tell me to go

Make me believe in love
The first minute I saw your face
I believed in love
No way to fight the feeling 
Only one way to go
Maybe time will make it right
I know life aren't over
You make me believe in lo-o-o-o-ove

Still hear the whispers
Thought I could die
Do you remember
Things that you said
I wanna hold you to the end of time
Never regret me
Never let go

Make me believe in love
The first minute I saw your face
I believed in love
No way to fight the feeling 
Only one way to go
Maybe time will make it right
I know life aren't over
You make me believe in lo-o-o-o-ove

I just wanna have you near
Hold my hand
I show you what love means to me

Believe in love
Yeah
Believe in love

Only one way to go
(Baby time will make) Baby time will make it right
(I know life aren't over)
You make me believe in love

Make me believe in love
The first minute I saw your face
I believed in love
No way to fight the feeling 
Only one way to go
Maybe time will make it right
I know life aren't over
You make me believe in lo-o-o-o-ove
