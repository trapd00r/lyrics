from the movie _Wildstyle_  

 If you was born in New york City let me hear say "You know that"!  

 YOU KNOW THAT  

  

 Aiyyo  once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets  you see stress  

 Streets a matter of life and death  no regrets  

 Life's a test  strife  wit special effects  

 Neighbourhood's full of reps  cities are projects  

 Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets  

 And comrades quest to be the next, to finess  

 Collect debts and select bets with death threats  

 Object - Chedder, better your total net  

 Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits  

 Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect  

 Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat  

 The smell of gunsmoke more common than cigarettes  

 WE GOT clicks for wreck  

 WE LIKE Pits for pets  

 WE GOT Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets  

 WE LIKE much respect and sex extra wet  

 And High-Tech dialect you ain't catch yet  

  

 (The Bronx  

 Ya out there?  

 No doubt  

 Brooklyn  

 ya out there)

 Aiyyo, we got blocks and glocks with  

 big shots with big knots and big props  

 yo this is where the bullshit stops  

 where herbs get got  

 if you snitch you get shot  

 we get down and leave the town in a state of shock  

 WE GOT dangerous hang out spots and slick cops  

 place called Riker's Island where kids get locked  

 a lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops  

 styles are top notch, this is the place to buy  

 so bust the box the radio station is hot  

 ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops  

 flip scripts for chips  

 and new Whips of the lot  

 quick to call a shot, pollitic with thick plots  

 And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got 

 to make sure the core of the big apple don't rot  

 where seeings believing we be achieving a lot  

 since disc jocks created hip hop, check it out!  

  

 (Queens  

 ya out there?  

 no doubt  

 Manhatten  

 no doubt  

 New York city  

 Staten Island  

 New york new york  

 long Island  

 New york  

 ya out there)  

  

 [Rakim]  

 Aiyo, we got five bouroughs of ghettos  

 with amny places to meet, you get lost in city streets  

 the city that never sleeps  

 Mecca ? Medina the population increase  

 the desert and the oasis, New York, the far east  

 with gods and Sheiks  

 pretty amazons for weeks  

 player dons that fleece the family's black sheep  

 icons that teach that we all act unique  

 we got stats to reach so we all have to eat  

 a mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece  

 the crafts elite, we going past the beat  

 the latest technique no other place get as deep  

 who parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes  

 DJs and MCs and graffiti artistes  

 who use walls and subway trains for marquees  

 we go back to b-boys, breakdancing, breakbeats  

 and it'll never cease and on that note  

 we say peace
