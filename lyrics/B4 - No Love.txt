I will be the one to  love and comfort you from now until the day I die.
I will take you places that you only think about when you're asleep at night.
Let me take the time to understand and I will SET YOUR SPIRIT FREE.

If you get down on me, I'll get down on you.
I will do anything that you want me to.
It's a game of give and take to make it through.
So if you get down on me, I'll get down on you tonight.

When night time turns to day again.
And you are on my mind.
winter turns to spring and then,
life has past you by.
But now we are so young and free.
But we're running out of time.
So while we've got each other here.
Let's treat our bodies right.

I wanna know, exactly what to do,
So that you'll never get me off of your mind.
Communicate, and I'll go undercover
Gonna make you come tonight,
Over to my house,

If you get down on me, I'll get down on you,
I will do anything that you want me to,
It's a game of give and take to make it through.
So if you get down on me, I'll get down on you tonight.

I'm not the type to change your mind,
If you wanna take it slow.
No pressure to go all the way.
Just to the places we can go.

Anytime is the right time to reveal it when two people
Fall as deep as you and me,
I wanna know every inch of your body, so I can set your spirit free.

If you get down on me, I'll get down on you,
I will do anything that you want me to,
It's a game of give and take to make it through.
So if your get down on me, I'll get down on you tonight.

I will be the one to  love and comfort you from now until the day I die.
I will take you places that you only think about when you're asleep at night.
If you open up to me,
I'll make you realize the things that you could never see.
Let me take the time to understand and I will SET YOUR SPIRIT FREE.

If you get down on me, I'll get down on you,
I will do anything that you want me to,
It's a game of give and take to make it through.
So if your get down on me, I'll get down on you tonight.

If you get down on me, I'll get down on you,
I will do anything that you want me to,
It's a game of give and take to make it through.
So if your get down on me, I'll get down on you tonight.
