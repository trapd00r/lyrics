Remember that night
White sails in the moonlight
They walked it too
Through empty playground, this ghost's town

Children again
On rusting swings getting higher
Sharing a dream
On an island, it felt right

We lay side by side
Between the moon and the tide
Mapping the stars for a while

Let the night surround you
We're halfway to the stars
Ebb and flow, let it grow
Feel the warmth beside you

Remember that night
The warmth and the laughter
Candles burn
Though the church was deserted

At dawn we went down
Through empty streets to the harbour
Dreamers may leave
But we're here everafter

Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da

Let the night surround you
We're halfway to the stars
Ebb and flow, let it grow
Feel the warmth beside you
