Sometimes at night I miss you 
And then I long to kiss you 
I think of you - got me feeling so blue 
Cos I need you so - I miss you so - miss you 

My heart is beating 
Boom boom boom 
My heart is pumping 
Doom doom doom 
It's asking why did you tell me those lies 
When you promised your love was so true oh baby 
My heart is beating 
Boom boom boom 
My heart is jumping 
Doom doom doom 
There was a night when you held me so tight 
In your arms I was falling for you - I miss you 

We put our dreams together 
A case of now or never 
You took my hand and I knew in the end 
When we meet again - I'll kiss you - oh kiss you
