When I was a young boy
And drove my mother wild.
I met a maiden in the woods
And she said "Child-
Look into my green eyes
And at my auburn hair
When you're a man you'll never see
A girl quite as fair."

Remember me, oh remember me.
Remember for the rest of your life.

Her eyes were green and glossy, and looking right at me.
Her hair was red and grown with leaves just like an autumn tree.
She lifted her tiny hand and she made a little turn.
She swayed in the wind just like a graceful bird.

Just right then she vanished, but when I was full grown.
I had a girl just like her to be my very own.
Now I'm a man, and I'd marry if I could.
But I can't forget the memory of the girl from the wood.

Remember me, oh remember me.
Remember for the rest of your life.
