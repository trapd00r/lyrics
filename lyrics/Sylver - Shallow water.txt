Sitting here
No answers near
All I know
Before the curtain dropped
You left the show

Shallow water
Rippled by tears
Shallow water
Mirrored my fears
Silent raindrops
Soothin my skin
Still the answers
Still locked down within

Lying here
Future unclear
All I know
Before the curtain dropped
You left the show

Shallow water
Rippled by tears
Shallow water
Mirrored my fears
Silent raindrops
Soothin my skin
Still the answers
Still locked down within
Shallow water

Shallow water
Rippled by tears
Shallow water
Mirrored my fears
Silent raindrops
Soothin my skin
Still the answers
Still locked down within

Shallow water
Rippled by tears
Shallow water
Mirrored my fears
Silent raindrops
Soothin my skin
Still the answers
Still locked down within
Shallow water
