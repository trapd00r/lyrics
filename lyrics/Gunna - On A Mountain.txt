Run that back, Turbo

Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, yeah
All this water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)
That can't wait, sayin' I need an accountant (Yuh), count it up
He told me I don't need the vouchers (Vouchers)
He got Hi-Tech seals in the couches
Comin' in LA and I done smoked me three whole ounces (Yuh, yuh)
Pulled up in the same state, performin' in different counties (Yuh)
Four rings on my fingers, eight arrows in my Audi (Ayy)

That's on everything, everything, yeah
Walk in the mall buy everything
And we didn't have change on Chanel strings
Play no games, Alexander Wang on her nail paint
Your drip insane, where the fuck my paint? Stop playin' games
Watch your range, my nut deranged, they actin' ways
Broke and paid, the condo late, that Frito Lay (Lay)
Them the strange, don't see no shade, they don't see waves
My new-new babe loves lemonade, like Beyonce
We the wave, ahh, floodin' out of PDK (PDK)
Smashin' in the Lamb I barely use the breaks (Use the breaks)
I'm in the wallet, it's my birthday, I got Buku cake (Buku cake)
I had to make it a little hard for you to feel the lake

Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, yes
All this water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)
That can't wait, sayin' I need an accountant (Yuh), count it up
He told me I don't need the vouchers (Vouchers)
He got Hi-Tech seals in the couches
Comin' in LA and I done smoked me three whole ounces (Yuh, yuh)
Pulled up in the same state, performin' in different counties (Yuh)
Four rings on my fingers, eight arrows in my Audi (Ayy)

Yeah, real slatt
Uh, took your bitch, I'm smashin' her like my Hellcat
Do as I please I'm poppin' whatever I feel, yeah (I feel, yeah)
Like Percocet or if I throw this pill back (Pill back)
Like, slime, I keep a TEC, ain't finna get killed yet (Nah)
Life ain't Tom and Jerry, niggas are real rats (Real rats)
Time is poured on me when I ride that Maybach (That Maybach)
If he want some smoke, then nigga, just say that (Just say that)
Gunna is fashion, got my new nickname, sex ('Name, sex)
Feelin' so cap I bought him a real hat (Real hat)
Donut on my neck, young Gunna I'm paid that (I'm paid that)
Love my bitch new drip, still can't get attached (Can't get attached)
Hit a line and told her go bring my feeling back

Feel like I'm sittin' on a mountain, yeah
All this water on me look like a fountain (Fountain, fountain)
That can't wait, sayin' I need an accountant (Yuh), count it up
He told me I don't need the vouchers (Vouchers)
He got Hi-Tech seals in the couches
Comin' in LA and I done smoked me three whole ounces (Yuh, yuh)
Pulled up in the same state, performin' in different counties (Yuh)
Four rings on my fingers, eight arrows in my Audi (Ayy)
