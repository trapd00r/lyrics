(Part I: Tharos Last Flight)

Oh, cruel, destiny... The tears soon covered the warrior's face and Tharos,
the beloved dragon, spread his wings for the last time, happy to have found
the freedom at least in death... Fly... fly high, mighty Tharos... Your name
will always be remembered by the people of the enchanted lands... and your
memory will march with us forever against the hordes of the black lord for
the salvation of the enchanted lands.
Goodbye, brother... goodbye...!!

(Part II: The Hymn of the Warrior)

God of dawn, father of thunder
Lord of the wind now blowing on me
Thank you for all, for your holy sign
For mountains and hills, the forest, the sea
for all those dead and for my princess
they'll shed their blood cause finally
the emerald sword is now mine

(Part III: Rex Tremende)

For what you did to them
you will burn in my hate

Son of hell betrayer of light
king of the dark your name is carved on my steel
for your will the innocent die every day
but my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever

Rex tremende semper inimice
ad gloriam perpetuam brave all we'll march
to give you the eternal agony

Love magic word fill all my dreams eternally use me
Love guide me to ecstasy to victory to infinity
to rhymes of winds to the voice of the dead
to innocence of my memory

Rape of earth I want your head
sadist pig I can't forgive what you did
all the blood you're sucking out of my land
But my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever

Rex tremende semper inimice
ad gloriam perpetuam brave all we'll march
to give you the eternal agony

(Part IV: The Immortal Fire)

Go, mighty warrior... The kings of enchanted lands are awaiting your
victory! Ride on the wings of wisdom, ride beyond the middle valleys to
defeat the master of chaos in the name of cosmoc justice. Peace and love
forever!
