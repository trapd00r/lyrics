You and I headed straight into the west
Sun is rising behind we're heading straight into the darkness
And it's been so long since I've seen you
But I'm forced to stare at these lines
That are laid out here before me
Say you love me give me peace of mind

Chorus:
Straight into the darkness headed you and I
Straight into the darkness further into the night
But at least you are here with me
We're here together side by side
Straight into the darkness headed you and I
Time is running fast another hour come and gone

Plenty of road ahead behind the mornings coming on
I can feel you sleeping beside me
But I'm forced to stare at these lines
While you toss and turn and you dreaming
Say you love me give me such peace of mind

[ Chorus ]
Later in the afternoon and the sun is setting low
Way to home is mind in the middle of the pine trees and the snow
You wish to speak to me darling I love you best
You're never far from me even when in the old darkness
And it's been so long since I've seen you
Now I'm racing home to be by your side
While you bend out here before me
Got me home dear give me such peace of mind

[ Chorus ]
