No, I don’t remember
What brought us to this
What places we blindly passed
What turns we missed
When things really mattered
And we really cared
Simply being was easy
Just having you there

I was on a downslide, wasting my days
Then I met you and came to such a lovely place
We laughed and cried our way through
The days and nights
The weeks and months
And all the seasons ups and downs

Remind me of how I used to feel
Remind me of who I used to be
Back when nothing could come between us
Back when that thought would never leave us

‘Cause I don’t remember
Love needles and the hay
The life I knew by heart and lived everyday
The secret codes and signs
You and I eye to eye
Wake me up, hurt me, you have to!
I forgot how to cry

Remind me of how I used to feel
Remind me of who I used to be
Back when nothing could came between us then
Back when that thought would never leave us
