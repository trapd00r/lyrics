Burn like a furnace keep it hot like a thermos
It's the realest at your service, now I'm on a higher purpose
And You haters don't deserve us but we give it to you like a virus
We are the highest motherfuckers ruling from the hills of Cypress
Mister magnificent you are insignificant see what is in my weed sack bitch
Try sniffing it sending I hit it smells so aromatic smoking out the room
Sorry homie it's a fucking habit
Mad dough comfortably shadowed from the fucking sun
Run up on me and watch a nigga give you some
I am swinging for the fence blasting up home runs
Go with a knife cut your ass like a shogun
A Little something for the peasant yanking on my chain
You the reason a niggas sing about a membrane
Running round like a clown acting hell strange
On the real the world forgot about your punk name

We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're are calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high

See my mind is at the pinnacle stress levels are minimal
You see a criminal label labeled defined unwinable
You are so cynical smoke like is fucking legal
Either way the people represent if nothing equal
Yes spark it up date time start it up
You got a problem I'm a rolling Stone start it up
You stop me on a promise you will never stop
Last thing you hear is the blast when the hammer drops
When you with a sick click, we uncheckable Cyprus hill misfits
Bring it through the vegetables
Bring in cloud smoke representable the highest man to toke and his general
The next stack with us ready for war me we are done
The nature stands with us, ready for war
We done talking two digits and we still want more
I could call you up by name but what the fuck for
You under my sneaker that I stomp on the floor

We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're are calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by

We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're are calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high

See my mind's at the pinnacle stress levels are minimal
