(Joan Jett)

She works real hard to try to make things right
To see if she can find a reason for what's wrong
In life she puts her thoughts into magazine form
And passes them all around her dorm
Showing me another way another way to fight

Activity Grrrl trying to change the world
She's gonna knock on your door
Activity Grrl in an uptight world
She's impossible to ignore

She spends her days involved in community things
And at night she'll go out to a club where she likes to sing
She teaches so the others will know
There's more beneath the skin that doesn't show
And she's looking at the challenge that tomorrow's bringing

Activity Grrrl trying to change the world
She's gonna knock on your door
Activity Grrl in an uptight world
She's impossible to ignore

Hopes to fix the problems that come within her space
And takes hurting people real serious you can see it on her face
She can't accept that life is unfair
She wants to think the others care
And won't go away she's gonna stay right in your face

Activity Grrrl trying to change the world
She's gonna knock on your door
Activity Grrl in an uptight world
She's impossible to ignore

Activity Grrrl trying to change the world
She's gonna knock on your door
Activity Grrl in an uptight world
She's impossible to ignore
