So little time, so little time - I'm so frustrated
So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
So little time, so little time, time to work it on out
Yeah yeah

So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
I feel I'm stumbling in the dark - Somnambulated
I feel my heart seekin' the sparks, and prayin' for love
Love love ...Prayin' for love

So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
So little time, so little time ...when your heart's been faded
So little hope, so little hope - and I'm prayin' again for love
Love love ...is more than enough

Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Is more than enough, yeah yeah
(x2)

Simply being loved, yeah yeah
Is more than enough, yeah yeah
Simply being loved, yeah (is more than enough)

So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
So little time, so little time ...to get acclimated
So little hope, so little hope, and I'm prayin' now for love
Yeah

So little time the pace has changed, but I'm still waiting
A thousand years of timeless days - Somnambulating
I'm stumbling wounded in the dark, but I'm prayin' still for love
Love love... Prayin' for love

Love love love ...Simply be loved (love love)

So little hope, so little hope, and I'm prayin' still for love
Love love ...prayin' for love

So little hope, so little time - It's so frustrating
I feel I'm stumbling in the dark - Somnambulated
I feel my heart seekin' the sparks, but I'm prayin' still for love
