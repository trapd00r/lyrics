Love be still, love be sweet
Don't you dare change a thing
I want to photograph you with my mind
To feel how I feel now all the time

Say that you'll stay forever this way
Forever and forever
That we'll never have to change
Don't move, don't breathe
Don't change, don't leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
Oh, we'll stay
This way

I get afraid
I don't think ahead
Let's just stay this way in bed
Feels so good inside your arms
Home is everywhere that you are

Say that you'll stay forever this way
Forever and forever
That we'll never have to change
Don't move, don't breathe
Don't change, don't leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
Oh, we'll stay
This way

Don't move, don't breathe
Don't change, don't leave
Promise me we'll always be
The sky's so sweet
It's good to me
Promise me we'll always be

Say that you'll stay forever this way
Forever and forever
That we'll never have to change
Don't move, don't breathe
Don't change, don't leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
Oh, we'll stay
This way
