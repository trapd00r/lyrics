We never fear the night, we bring our own starlight
Dropped on the world below, wait for the afterglow

We never fear the night, we bring our own starlight
Dropped on the world below, wait for the afterglow
And in the dark they wed, we're dancing with the dead
And if the ground's been stained, colors run in the rain

Run away, no delay - do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you
Hear the press, nothing less - saying that we don't care
Understand it's the land and you'd have to be there

We never contemplate, we only offer fate
And in the night they arc, flowering in the dark
Filling the sky with red, till all their needs are fed
Then like the childhood tear they quickly disappear

Run away, no delay - do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you
Hear the press, nothing less - saying that we don't care
Understand it's the land and you'd have to be there

Run away, no delay - do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you
Hear the press, nothing less - saying that we don't care
Understand it's the land and you'd have to be there
