Would you believe me if I said
I never meant to hurt you, like I hurt myself
With you I was numbing all my pain
I will always bury my head in the sand
Stand by your side, just a ghost of a man
I thought I was better, must have been dreaming
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
I guess it's true what people say
We never really change
My minds just forget
If I was strong enough to stay
You would always carry your burdens alone
I was and I still am, my father's son
I thought I was better, must have been dreaming

You will always be waiting
And wave from the shore
I'm out on that island, no matter where I go
I thought I could be good
Must have been dreaming
We must have been dreaming
We must have been dreaming
