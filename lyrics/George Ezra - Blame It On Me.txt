The garden was blessed
By the Gods of me and you
We headed west to find
Ourselves some truth

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

We counted all our reasons
Excuses that we make
We found ourselves some treasure
And threw it all away

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

When I dance alone
And the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control
And the veil's overused
Blame it on me

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

Caught in the tide of blossom
Caught in the carnival
Your confidence forgotten
I see the gypsies run

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

When I dance alone
And the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control
And the veil's overused
Blame it on me

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?

When I dance alone
And the sun's bleeding down
Blame it on me
When I lose control
And the veil's overused
Blame it on me

When I dance alone
I know, I'll go
Blame it on me
When I lose control
I know, I'll go
Blame it on me

What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
