Naked in the bathtub, sitting on the porcelain
Waiting for that little hurricane to pull your torso in
The water don't run, just drips like rain
Still drips like a painkiller drips to the veins
Fill it up with a bag of that happy stuff
'Cause the way she runs out, you can tell she ain't had enough
Good times goddess, my goodness
Goth finger nail polish, autopilot foot prints
With a smile that's stitched to the fabric of bedtime tales
That keep them kids out of the attic
The mouth of madness, loud and manic
The motive of the bird holding south on the atlas
Picture a hole, put your hero in
Envision the gold, now zero in
Been watching your night train track for the last few stops
With no desire to hop it
How did we end up in your apartment
Pocket full of gossip says this ain't smart
When it's all said and done, can't get restart
But I'll be damned if I don't wanna kiss you--
Hard

Shoulda known better not to fuck wit' you
Ain't got nothin' but too much to lose
Lost in the rush don't know what to do
That drug got you like I want you

Shoulda known better not to fuck wit' you
Ain't got nothin' but too much to lose
Lost in the rush don't know what to do
That drug got you like I want you


I've got a restraining order against Satan's daughter
And I keep it at the bottom of this Jameson and water
And when we get there, you can sit there and stare
From behind your mascara and your thick hair
I'm aware of that pain you harbor
The same negative game to the names you martyr
Apart from the details and substance and whatnot
I fucks with that hunger of love pistol gut rot
Bloodshot, give me one shot, my shot
Propped up on enough talk to make time stop
The lines of chalk that benjamin might cop
Killed the illustrations on the neighborhood sidewalks
Then all of a sudden she got silent
Pupils like marbles, hide behind eyelids
Get away sticks go limping hole place
The fucked up smile sucked up most of her face
Truly beauty, the scene serene
And each criticism becomes redeemed
Swallow my words, no more judgment, it's through
'Cause you look like what I feel like when I'm with you

Shoulda known better not to fuck wit' you
Ain't got nothin' but too much to lose
Lost in the rush don't know what to do
That drug got you like I want you

Shoulda known better not to fuck wit' you
Ain't got nothin' but too much to lose
Lost in the rush don't know what to do
That drug got you like I want you
