A picture paints a thousand words
As one door closes another door opens
Two wrongs don't make a right

Now good things come to those who wait
Take the highs with the lows dear
You'll get what you're given
And everything's gonna be all right

(What the uff do you know?)
Just 'cause you're old you think you're wise
(Who the hell are you though?)
I didn't even ask for your advice
(You wanna keep your mouth shut?)
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere?
('Cause you're doing in my nut)
And do you think I care?

Say what you say, do what you do
Feel what you feel as long as it's real
I said take what you take and give what you give
Just be what you want just as long as it's real

Now by a horse I once was told
That all that glitters is not gold
And all that is to fear is fear itself

This horsey also told me
I should keep my friends close
But keep my enemies closer
So as to protect myself

(What the uff do you know?)
Just 'cause you're old you think you're wise
(Who the hell are you though?)
I didn't even ask for your advice
(You wanna keep your mouth shut?)
You wanna take your thoughts elsewhere?
('Cause you're doing in my nut)
And do you think I care?

Say what you say, do what you do
Feel what you feel as long as it's real
I said take what you take and give what you give
Just be what you want just as long as it's real

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Say what you say, do what you do
Feel what you feel as long as it's real
I said take what you take and give what you give
Just be what you want just as long as it's real

Say what you say, do what you do
Feel what you feel as long as it's real
I said take what you take and give what you give
Just be what you want just as long as it's real

Say what you say, do what you do
Feel what you feel as long as it's real
I said take what you take and give what you give
Just be what you want just as long as it's real
