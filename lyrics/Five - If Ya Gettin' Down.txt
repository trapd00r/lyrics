If ya getting down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby
(say number 1)2X

I wanna take a little time
To refresh your mind
Because the boyz are back in town
With a different kinda funk who's got da funk
We's got da funk ' right!
Everybody wanna boogie down tonight

Now throw your hands up in the sky
Move em round from side to side
I got what it takes
The beats that brace the funky bass I'll
Give your body crazy shakes (come on)

I heard somebody say (what?)
She's at the party so (huh)
Im gonna get me some (uhhhhhhhh)

(Chorus)

Wiggi wiggi I'm getting jiggy, open up the door,
I got the keys to your city
You're lookin' kinda pretty
Dance til you drop and it don't stop til
It goes pop

Dance how you wanna dance

Let's all get down while we got da chance
I've still got 12 seconds on the clock
That's mine
And I aint gonna stop 'til the sun
Don't shine

Line after line
I flow like rhyme after rhyme
Just like time after time

Keep it up til you feel the heat
And get down once you feel the beat

I heard somebody say (what?)
She's at the party so (huh)
Im gonna get me some (uhhhhhhhh)

If ya getting down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby

If ya getting down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby

There ain't no problem that we can't fix
Cos we can do it in the mix
Now if your man gives you trouble
We'll be there on the double
Guaranteed we'll be hittin' for six
(Come on yeah)

I heard somebody say (what?)
She's at the party so (huh)
Im gonna get me some (uhhhhhhhh)

If ya getting down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby

If ya getting down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby

If ya getting down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby

If ya getting down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby
