Over a night
I got yours and no others
Now we’ll make a life
Of those hours
I got yours
On a misty height

And so be the morning
I knew all about treasures
Where it was going
But nothing about measures
I got yours
In fronof the fading sun

During the day we could’nt talk about
Moving
You said I was late
But that you knew I was coming
I got yours
In the enlighttened night

And later this evening
I was so full of you
Bow I only have things
I must not ever lose
I am yours
So let every morning come

Just after midnight
You now I can’t go
Back where you can’t follow
I must stay with you
I’ll be yours
Forever will be the shortest time

Over a night
I got yours and I love you
So light and so easy
I love you I love you
I’m yours
