Don't see any rainbow
All I see is raindrops falling
Don't see any moonlight
All I see is darkness falling

I don't wanna be here
And I don't want a lifetime here without you

Don't hear any children
All I hear is mothers calling
Suddenly the silence
Everything is slowly falling

I don't wanna be here
And I don't want a lifetime here without you

I can't stand to watch you go
Isn't there a prayer we all know?
I can barely look into your eyes now

I don't wanna lose you
And I don't wanna lose you now

I can't stand to watch you go
Isn't there a prayer we all know?
I can barely look into your eyes now

I don't wanna lose you now

Don't see any rainbow
All I see is raindrops falling

I don't wanna lose you
