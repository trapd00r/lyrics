I pray for peace
They require me to kick into high gear
We may as well have our Ph.D.'s
My quick impulse was never taken into account

I pray they let out or talk it out
She would give me a wink across the room
I would've made a really good lawyer
I had a really good strategy
For putting things back on the wall of the world

Thank God it was the goddamned wall
I would have to hide all my valuables
Who would calm my mother down?
Who would calm me down once I talked her through it?

My mother and I were the official peacemakers
It was a full-time job
I would send my mother directly to bed, yeah
Don't collect 200
We'd talk about it till 5 A.M.
When I'd come visiting her 5 years later

We would pray for peace
It was most comfortable and familiar
