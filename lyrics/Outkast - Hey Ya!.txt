One, two, three, uh

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really want to
But can't stand to see me walk out the door (Ah)

Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how

Come on, hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all (Ah)

We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is
Nothing is forever

Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, then what makes (What makes, what makes)
Then what makes love the exception?

So why oh, why oh
Why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
