Oh how wrong not to be loved by you 
I'll go far if I could by you
And my cause no it don't make sense
And my conscious it won't let me
I won't rest
I, I want to be loved by you

Oh how wrong not to be loved by you
I'd go far if I could by you
And my heart is a vivid road
Covered up in the winter snow
But the sun will show
I, I want to be loved by you
