Waking up
Your the one I used to know
Where did it stop
Still it feels like letting go
I hear voices deep inside
Now that I have fleed from life
Still I wonder why

I believe every word is true
I still believe one day I'll get over you
I see shadows on the wall
Will you catch me when I fall
I had so much to give
I believe
I believe
I see shadows on the wall
Will you catch me when I fall
I had so much to give
I believe

You and I searching for a place to grow
Out of sight since you left me all alone

I believe I still believe
I see shadows on the wall
Will you catch me when I fall
I had so much to give
I believe
