Oh, come save me
Heaven from your every sound
Thinking oh, you got me craving
Always with my love come down

Oh, come save me
I'll show you that the truth stand by
Thinking oh, this is crazy
Ever since I can't go out

I've been going on, I've been going on
I've been going on, I've been going on
I've been going on, I've been going on

Oh, come save me
Heaven from your every sound
Thinking oh, you got me craving
Always with my love come down

Oh, come save me
I'll show you that the truth stand by
Thinking oh, this is crazy
Ever since I can't go out

I've been going on, I've been going on
I've been going on, I've been going on
I've been going on, I've been going on
