Merry run around, sailing up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection
They love each other

Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

He could pass his time around some other line
But you know, he chose this place beside her
Don't get in the way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do
They love each other

Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
*And when that train rolls in, you wonder where it's been
*You gotta try and see a little further
*They love each other

â¬†(Additional lyrics from 1973 version)
*Though you'll make a noise, just can't hear your voice
*They're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober
*They love each other

Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

Hope you will believe what I say is true
Everything I did, I heard it first from you

Heard your news report, you know you're falling short
Pretty soon, won't trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You gotta try to see a little further
They love each other

Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
