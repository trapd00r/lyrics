I imagine you here
Close
Sharing my bed
My love
With you a million kisses
Would never be enough

Iâd need more
So much
More
I know youâre the one
I want in my life

I imagine you here
Close
Sharing my bed
My love
With you a million kisses
Would never be enough

Iâd need more
So much
More
I know youâre the one
I want in my life

With you a million kisses
Would never be enough
Iâd need more
So much
I know youâre the one
I want in my life

Calling your name
Canât you hear me call?
Calling your name
Calling your name
Calling, oh, calling

Calling your name
Canât you hear me call?
Calling your name
Calling your name

Calling your name
Canât you hear me call?
Calling your name
Calling your name

The though of you leaves me
Weak
Messing my head
My heart
Iâm driven by desire
I could never turn back

Iâd need more
So much
More
I know youâre the one
I want in my life

Calling your name
Canât you hear me call?
Calling your name
Calling your name
Calling, oh, calling

Calling your name
Calling your name
Calling your name
Calling your name
Calling your name
