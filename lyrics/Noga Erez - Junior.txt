[Verse 1]
Their poisonous hand is feeding me
I'm choked by the same hand that caresses me

[Chorus 1]
Say what, say what, say what will get you here
Say what will make you stay and wait until
After it's done, sealed
'Cause it's all you have to give me

[Verse 2]
They tighten the grip still around my wrists
One pulled by a string, and one bends into a fist

[Chorus 2]
Say what, say what, say what could get you here
Say what will make you stay and wait until
After it's done, sealed
'Cause it's all you have to give me
