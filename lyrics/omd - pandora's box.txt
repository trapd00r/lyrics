Born in Kansas on an ordinary plain
Ran to New York but ran away from fame
Only seventeen when all your dreams come true
But all you wanted was someone to undress you
And all the stars you kissed could never ease the pain
Still the grace remains and though the face has changed
Youâre still the same

And itâs a long long way from where you want to be
And itâs a long long road, but youâre too blind to see

Frame of silence of an innocent divine
Is a dangerous creation when you fall the test of time
And all the photographs of ghosts of long ago
Still they hurt you so, wonât let go
And you still donât know

And itâs a long long way from where you want to be
And itâs a long long road, but youâre too blind to see

When you look around yourself now, do you recognize the girl
The one, who broke a thousand hearts, terrified the world

And all the stars you kissed could never ease the pain
Still the grace remains and though the face has changed
Youâre still the same

And itâs a long long way from where you want to be
And itâs a long long road, but youâre too blind to see

And itâs a long long way from where you want to be
And itâs a long long road, but youâre too blind to see
