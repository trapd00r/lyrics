If the sun
Refused to shine
Down on me
'Till the end of time
As long as I have your caress
Your tenderness
I will be blessed

If the stars
Refused their light
Just for me
They stayed out of sight
If you say you love me best
I won't care less 
I will be blessed

If the wind won't blow your name
Until I'm still
I will
If it's whispered from above
The highest hill
I will

If the moon
Up in the sky
Turned its face
From the lonely eye
I could never be distressed
Or love you less
I will be blessed
