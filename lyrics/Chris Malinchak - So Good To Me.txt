I feel so much sensation

You've been so good to me
Give you anything
You've been so good to me
Your love inside me

Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation
Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation

Every sky will be blue
As long as you're lovin' me, lovin' me

You've been so good to me
Give you anything
You've been so good to me
Your love inside me

Oh baby, you're my consolation
Oh baby, there's no hesitation

Every sky will be blue
As long as you're lovin' me, lovin' me
