One day I was walking to school
I saw these bullies 
And they thought they were cool
They put me down and they pushed me around
They stole my book and they called me a clown

Give it back, baaack
Yeah you dirty rat
You better give it back

I went to school
Yeah I went anyway
I said I'd show them another day
I brought my mom and my daddy too
I got 'em thrown right out of school

I got em back, baaack
Yeah I got 'em back
You know I got 'em back
Ba-ba-ba-ba back

That night I was walking home
And when they got me I was all alone
A bloody nose and a broken bone
I thought those brats were gonna leave me alone

They got me back, baaack
You big dirty rat
You know they got me back
I tell ya back, I'll be back, baaa-aa-aaack
You did get me back
You know they got me, they got me back
