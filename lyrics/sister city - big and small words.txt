I dreamt that everyone I love was dead
And I wept; when I woke up, my pillow was wet
I know who is in control
I start slow, but speed up as I go

But oh no, I don't ever listen
And oh no, I don't care enough

Sometimes I don't let myself see past my own skull
My eyes closed, I think I see the world in total
I know who is in control
I start slow, but speed up as I go

But oh no, I don't ever listen
And oh no, I don't care enough

I've come to see the savagery
In open jawed hypocrisy
With sunken eyes and calloused feet
I'm tired and I'm bored
I've always known the tragedy
Complacent in depravity
Catastrophe and apathy

And other words that rhyme like that
Like cat and hat and sat and fat
I am only useful if I'm self-contained

But oh no I have always listened
Oh no I care far too much
