How do you feel to shoot down your brother now
And bury us in cages of cement and steel
What do you see when you look at one another now
Who do you see tell me how do you feel

Sing a song for the children who are gone
Sing a song for Diana
Huntress of the moon and a lady of the Earth
Weather woman Diana
