Eminem
Girls (Limp Bizkit Diss)

Ayo dog
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that
I need to get off cuz
If I don't
I'ma fucking explode or somethin
Now look
This is the story about
Some little fuckin girls that I know
It goes like this

It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickenin
People are lookin for an excuse to jump on my shit list
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in a position that
I don't wanna be in shit
I never had beef with you corny son of a bitches
But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it
So I'm telling you right now
Motherfucker Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real
B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin
See he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin 
I'da never involved you
But you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known
That song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV
Now look who's mentionin me
That little fuckin weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props on that song you on national TV
Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin 'bout how bad you hate him
Now you all in his thong
What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin sissy
Up on stage screaming how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act
And don't call me kissin my ass
Cuz I swear to God this ain't just a song
I'm trying to prewarn you
Lethal, when I fuckin see you dawg, I'm swingin on you
Motherfuckers must think cuz I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw
Up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all are some

Girls (y'all are some God damn girls)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies
You pussies keep talkin shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, ha)
How fuckin cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond
The beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked
See I was smart
I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I'll fight for Kim
All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all my dawgs from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Melman
Till I'm hoist away
In my coffin
I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I never give a fuck
I won't ever be interested
Love me or hate me
As much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated
The shit that I been through
My pencil never could pencil
But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
I'm not bein cocky
I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger
He sticks up his finger
I say fuck Christina
He says fuck Christina, but meaner
So from doin a song with Method
To beggin to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred
With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin you up punk
You're dead
Don't think that I'm playin
And fuck Bizkit
Cuz I know you're sayin fuck D12
Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves
Little

Girls (motherfucking females)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (now we all know the truth)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

And that's it
That's all there is to it dawg
If you don't wanna do the fuckin song
Don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV
Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford
That's it
That's all you had to fuckin say
I wouldn't a said shit
I woulda backed off
Did the motherfuckin song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it
That's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckingyou up shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Ha ha
