Goodbye to the island 
Hello to the rain 
It's gone like a dream in the night 
And it won't be back again

Goodbye to the island 
Where our bodies touched 
Goodbye to a little bit of heaven 
And I miss you so much 

(Oh) Why love did you treat me this way
Why love did you treat me this way 
Why love did you treat me this way 
Why love did you treat me this way 

A bed it is an island 
A world apart 
Soft words in the middle of the night 
Straight from the heart 
Two heads on a pillow 
So warm, so close 
Goodbye to the island 
Where, where it mattered the most 

(Oh) Why love did you treat me this way
Why love did you treat me this way 
Why love did you treat me this way 
Why love did you treat me this way 
Goodbye to the island 
Hello to the rain 
It's gone like a dream in the night 
And it won't be back again 
(Oh) Why love did you treat me this way
Why love did you treat me this way 
Why love did you treat me this way 
Why love did you treat me this way
