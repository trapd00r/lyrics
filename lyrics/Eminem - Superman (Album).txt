Eminem & Dina Rea :
Mmmhh
You high baby? Yeah
Yeah? Hahaha. Talk to me
You want me to tell you somethin'? Uh huh
I know what you wanna hear



'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

They call me superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down

In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face

I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, copin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice, to buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin', to be my new wife
What you Mariah, fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday-Monday
Monday through Sunday yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what
That's about as far as your buddy goes

We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then

You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie

But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday-Monday
Monday through Sunday yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Lets let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Ooh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

First thing you say
I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me

Ooh yeah girl run that game
Haily Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say
"Rot in Pieces", uhh that's great

First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool

There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy-wody you must be
Gone off that quarter bottle

You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands

Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday-Monday
Monday through Sunday yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Lets let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman

I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman
