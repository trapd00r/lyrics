Jay! Fuck that 
This is it right here baby! 
You know what it is 
[Jadakiss] 
Yo I used to have bad luck 
Now you might see me in a Jag truck 
Mad stuck either with a dime or a bad duck 
Double R T with the matchin bandana 
38 snub blue steel with no hammer 
And I see all ya niggaz tryin to glance at the Kiss 
Cuz I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist 
Phonin your women, drunk off Corona's and lemon 
And you know I'm still right in the main 
Light in the green 
I need to bug it even though I look right in the beam 
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails 
Niggaz floss on their album, try to boost their sales 
We put our pies on the table when our eyes on a label 
Cuz them rednecks up in the mountains will try to slay you 
Call me raspy tell you what I want you to know 
Fuck what you ask me you probably don't want me to blow 
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to stick 
Usually a good nigga even though I'm able to flip 
You pay 30 for the 'Kiss, 100 for The L.O.X&gt; 
And if we coo', then I write a hook for a drop 
Whatever's in the bank is my bet 
A zebu's my pet 
And get in the bed and with the legs then that 
[Sheek] 
Aiyyo, when my gun bust send niggaz to the fish like swamps and 
New York's youngest Bumpy Johnson 
I put fear in y'all heads 
Sheek looks type a nigga that gasoline yall beds 
And that's warning 
If you all alive in the morning, that's fine 
Now I suggest you hit the block and get what's rightfully mine 
I want PC, see me tuck in your chains 
I got niggaz my pops say that lifestyle ain't changed 
It's like wake up move a brick half-of-a-slow 
Make car money check with Sheek go fuck with a hoe 
I rock a waste slim mink do-rag under my fittish 
And I don't need rework waves, Timbs be halfway new 
That Sheek in the dresser club cuz I don't fuck with shoes 
And from a nigga's life, I swear to the Bible, let it be told 
I put 30 in your head, all in the same hole 
Cuz we all got the same goal and you tryin to tamper with mine 
Don't make me mothafuckin leave you with some shit in your spine 
Fuck with me, you be a was nigga 
Nigga was dope 
Nigga was gettin money before I extorted your coke 
What, you crazy? 
[Styles] 
Aiyyo, catch me with a 38, box and shells 
In a 98 Lincoln eatin pasta shells 
Order to go, always got a box of L's 
Blow, stay on the low 
Get a Henney and swig 
I Penuro so I hate a snake, rat, or a pig 
I pop shit cuz I'm the second best, the first was B.I.G. 
Y'all niggaz is shunned out, let me speak to your father 
Cuz I like to play chess and I swing the revolver 
If I don't like a nigga, I don't even be bothered 
I spit, I'm just a crooked nigga goin legit 
You hold your nine if you holdin a brick 
Common sense, that drama, you hit the Bahamas, get bent 
L.O.X. get respect like Sunny from Bronx Tale 
Us and DMX, the Ruff Ryder cartel 
Thirsty to live all y'all niggaz eager to die 
I tell all my niggaz ride 
You won't leave with a dime, motherfuckers 
[Jay-Z] 
Yeah, yeah, I'm a monster 
Sleep whole winters, wake up and spit summers 
Ghetto nigga puttin up Will Smith numbers 
Surrounded by 6's and Hummers 
Bitches among us 
Try not to let this bullshit become us 
This started from hunger, tell it all when they sane 
Now bitches notice the chains now that I've hit my number 
The chickens I twisted see the digits unlisted 
The beeper done change 
You dead bitch, the Reaper done came 
I suggest niggaz stop speakin my name 
Cause trust me, y'all can still feel the heat in the rain 
I keep creepin, streets keep watchin I keep poppin 
Niggaz is hot heads and the bullets is heat-seekin 
Jay flow pesos chase hoes NOT 
I just circle around the block in a drop 
Tell them to jump through the top 
Where the sun roof used to be 
I could see y'all not used to me 
Nigga flows like none other 
I'm the meanest, toughest Don Dutta, the gun butcha 
You the type that bust a lot of shots and none touch ya 
I'm the type that get excited when the gun touch ya 
Motherfuckers 
[DMX] 
I'm headed nowhere fast run in the place gun in my waste 
Niggaz wanted to taste but wouldn't come to my face 
So what that mean you cats is playin games again 
So what I do start namin names again(what!) 
All you motherfuckers know that I speak from the heart(uh!) 
Play like you dunno and L.O.X. is gonna bark 
We can take it there but to make it fair, get some mo niggaz 
Styles, Sheek, Jay we comin with like 4 niggaz(aight!) 
Y'all niggaz besta stop playin 
It'd be the ones you forgotten about 
That'll get you shot in your mouth 
*ARF! ARF!* Got my dogs covered 
Plus it's all gravy like chicken when it's smothered 
It's dark and I LOVE IT! get him, boy let him loose 
You want it with the dogg, let the gun, let him shoot
