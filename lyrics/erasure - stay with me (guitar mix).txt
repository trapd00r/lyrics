Tempered by greed
Tall buildings breathe
Give a sigh of relief when it's night
Stirring from sleep,
We night-owls creep
Is there any sign of life under this stone?
Star chime hollow and true.
Love, child

Weep for me...
And I will cast your wheels in motion
Walk with me...
The inner reaches of emotion

Sheltered by creed
One piled on one
Do you have a little room for one small one?
Light shine wild and free
Sun, rise

Weep for me...
And I will fill you with devotion
Walk with me...
The inner reaches of emotion

Here we are
In the sunshine
Everything is fine

Weep for me...
The sands of time will fill the ocean
Keep with me...
And like a roller on the ocean
Stand by me...
And I will fill you with devotion
Walk with me...
The inner reaches of emotion

Weep for me...
The sands of time will fill the ocean
Keep with me...
And rays of sunshine fill the ocean
