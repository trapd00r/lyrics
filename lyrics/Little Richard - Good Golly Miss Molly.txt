Good golly, Miss Molly
Sure like to ball, woo
Good golly, Miss Molly
Sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call

From the early, early mornin'
Till the early, early night
When I caught Miss Molly rockin'
At the house of blue light

Good golly, Miss Molly
Sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call

Mom and Poppa told me
"Son, you better watch your step"
If they knew about Miss Molly
I'd have to watch my Poppa's step

Good golly, Miss Molly
Sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call
Ah

Good golly, Miss Molly
Sure like to ball, woo
Good golly, Miss Molly
Sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call

Goin' to the corner
Gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you hug me and kiss me
Make me ting-a-ling-a-ling

Good golly, Miss Molly
Sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin'
Can't hear your momma call
