Do you mind if i can make your hair grow
Do you mind if im only 18
Do you care if i am out whith some friends
Do you care if i am feeling cold

Do you like when i am feeling thirsty
Do you like my anger or my pride

Called lover lead to saivior

I leave the, cold weather, make the earth grow.
no more making a rule. 
To the conclusion to the solution
no more days to fall

Would you fight for me if i was flirting,
Would you be my lover till the end.
Taking care,would you do that
Making that,i wouldnt need no else.

Called lover lead to saivior

I leave the, cold weather, make the earth grow
no more making a rule.
To the conclussion to the solution
no more days to fall....
