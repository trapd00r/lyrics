We're never alone cause' I'm thinking of her
when it's you and me
There's a picture of me next to hard to believe
in the dictionary

Said we were in love, but that ain't what I want now
What I want now, what I want now
Said you were the one, but that ain't what I want now
What I want now, what I want

I want your best friend, I need your best friend
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Trust me when I say that you can't trust me at all
And we can be best friends, but I want your best friend

Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Is Jessica around?

As soon as I saw you best friend
there in the entrance I knew you were destined
to remain friends, but share the rest if
you wear the pants, she wears the dresses
I'm not sexist, just obsessive
I've been watching her, I confess that
I sent her a message, couple of x's
Funny how a text can turn into breakfast
And that's how we got right here
Too many light strobe lights and light beer
Me and her just kicked into high gear,
That's weird, despite what you might hear
You want romance, but I don't slow dance
and I won't hold hands, so there is no chance
Anyways it's all we can show, just let me know

Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Is Jessica around?

Yeah, you make it seem so easy
Is that any way to keep me?
It's like you bring her out just to tease me
and she's so sick with it, oh, so, queasy
And you're so scevy,
blind to the fact that I'm leavin'
Cause the ribbons ain't up in the sky no more
I guess that's what friends are for

Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend

Said we were in love, but that ain't what I want now
What I want now, what I want now
Said you were the one, but that ain't what I want now
What I want now, what I want

I want your best friend, I need your best friend
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Trust me when I say that you can't trust me at all
And we can be best friends, but I want your best friend

Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Is Jessica around? I hear her comin' down
We can be best friends, but I want your best friend
Is Jessica around?
