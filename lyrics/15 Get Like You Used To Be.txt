15 minutes, excuse but I was wondering when,
You were gonna speak 'cause I saw you look in,
Back to the wall talking to all your friends,
Thinking... loud... do you see me again
Let me find out, you ain't get that love like you should
Let me find out, he aint putting it down, like you know I would,
Girl I know what is what you're looking for,
Girl I know what is just you need,
And you're tired of rolling business,
'Cause you need messing with me,
Come and find out, just the reason why we're running now,
Come and find out, what's all the hoopla, what's all the buzzing about
'Cause baby, you can get it, you can get it,
Tell me to say the world and I ain't kill it,
I'm no wasting your time, running my mind saying lies, to say what it's on my mind.

[Chorus:]
If you give me 15 minutes I'll make you feel like a woman tonight,
All I need is 15 minutes to take you on the ride of your life,
Baby, all I need is 15 minutes anymore than that will kill the vibe,
'Cause I bet you after 15 minutes, you need another 15, another 15 minutes of love.

Is about to get crazy, about to go down,
Seems like you're ready for the first round,
Hope you can handle what I give out
This aint a scandal, you stick around, is done now,
Baby hold on to me don't let go,
Don't act shy now, promise you be back begging for more,
Im throwing that D as Im doing my thang
You looking back like I'm crazy, deranged
Told you to deal told you this ain't a game,
You screaming out like you're going insane.

Oooh, finally getting what you deserve,
You can breathe now, giving you all of me that's my word,
Baby, baby you can get it, you can get it,
Tell me to save the world and I ain't go kill it,
I'm no wasting your time, running my mind saying lies,
To say what it's on my mind.

[Chorus:]
If you give me 15 minutes I'll make you feel like a woman tonight,
All I need is 15 minutes to take you on the ride of your life,
Baby, all I need is 15 minutes anymore than that will kill the vibe,
'Cause I bet you after 15 minutes, you need another 15 minutes, another 15 minutes to love.

Time to re-up, time for my second win
Time to go in, that was just the beginning,
Baby by now you should really know
Do what it was when you opened the door,
Lets' get the school all night,
I promise it will be all right.

[Chorus]

Do you want another 15 minutes (it don't take long when you know what you're doing)
