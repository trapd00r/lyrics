[Verse 1: 2-D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no
*Beep*

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: Trugoy the Dove]
Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear reppin' in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.Â 
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you jet ahead
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha
(Ha! Haha! Haha! Haha! Ha!)

[Refrain: 2-D]
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Outro: Trugoy the Dove & 2-D]
Don't stop, get it, get it (Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da)
Peep how your captain's in it (Feel Good)
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! (Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good)
Don't stop, get it, get it (Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da)
Peep how your captain's in it (Feel Good)
Steady, watch me navigate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! (Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good (Hahaha!)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good (Hahaha!)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good (Hahaha!)
Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, Feel Good (Hahahahahaha!)
