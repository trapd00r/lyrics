Forty miles left of Georgia road
Daniel sits there staring out
Michael knows it's over
I was tired but I was driving
Driving with a purpose and impatience

My ears were ringing from some fifty basement shows
Tires were burning hot from a million miles of road
I've had time to think of everything that hurt or made me happy with my lady
And as I pulled into Kentucky
It was happiness prevailed
In a skirt and golden smile
I saw that Molly cut your hair
No sleep for days but suddenly an end had finally come to all my waiting

My skin did glisten and my hair did stand on end
I was nervous as my words could never tell you how I felt
Like the way I suffer jealous and so worry about my lovers
Or like the way you hurt me so I couldn't think or speak or breathe or hardly eat
Though you tried to be forgiven
I have not the will or energy
Time has shown my actions with those of a man or a baby

Forty miles left of Georgia road
Daniel sits there staring out
Michael knows it's over
I was tired but I was driving
Driving with a purpose and impatience
And as I pulled into Kentucky
It was happiness prevailed
In a skirt and golden smile
I saw that Molly cut your hair
No sleep for days but suddenly an end had finally come to all my waiting
