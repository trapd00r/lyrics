Take away my soul
See the look upon my face
That's forever
Losing all control
Trying not to fall from grace
That's forever

We make the same mistakes
But some they take much longer
You like to show them to the world
It's just a photograph
A shot in space and time
I put my trust in you
But now I can't go on

Take away my soul
See the look upon my face
That's forever
Losing all control
Trying not to fall from grace
That's forever

If you could only know how this makes me feel
How did we let it get so far
Stealing my soul away for everyone to see
We can never be the same again, oh no, no

I am not a person willing to buy into this (I'm a free man)
I stand by my own decision I made long ago (I'm a free man)
I am stronger and I go my own way

We make the same mistakes
But some they take much longer
You like to show them to the world
It's just a photograph
A shot in space and time
I put my trust in you
But now I can't go on

Take away my soul
See the look upon my face
That's forever
Losing all control
Trying not to fall from grace
That's forever
