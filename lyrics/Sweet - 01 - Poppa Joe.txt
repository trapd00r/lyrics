In the midday sun
They beat on their drums
When Poppa Joe comes to town
With his coconut-rum
They can all have fun
They can drink it
Till the sun goes down
Poppa Joe just smiles politely
With the money he takes he might be
Very rich one day as he hears them say

Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Hey Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Hey Pop, Poppa, Poppa Joe

Ya never see a sad face
In the market place
When Poppa Joe comes around
For his coconut taste
You can see them race
Through the streets
You can hear the sound
All the ladies laughing gaily
Poppa Joe's still thinking maybe
He'll always hear the people say

Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Hey Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Hey Pop, Poppa, Poppa Joe

Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut...

Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Poppa rumbo rumbo
Hey Poppa Joe coconut
Hey Poppa Joe, hey Poppa Joe
Hey Pop, Poppa, Poppa Joe...
