Some people don't know how to dance
It's easy you just move your hips
Now as a chorus line advance
Tomorrow we'll do tango dips

You see darlings the whole world around
We all go wild for this new sound

Hustle 76
Everybody dance now
You gotta dance now

Hustle 76
Move don't make romance now
Please no romance now

Hustle 76
Everybody dance your life away

They sold a record on TV
Big melodies with simple beats
Dance music for the AM dial
Lyrics don't last not for [?]

What can I tell you, I was ten
I should have been in bed by then
I order

Hustle 76
Everybody dance now
You gotta dance now

Hustle 76
Move don't make romance now
Please no romance now

Hustle 76
Everybody dance your life away

Hustle 76
Everybody dance now
You got to dance now

Hustle 76
Move, don't make romance now
Please no romance now

Hustle 76
Everybody dance your life away

Hustle 76
Everybody dance your life away
