(You know) 
(You know listen to me) 
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl 
(That's true, so true) 

(You're the only girl I love too)
My heart was soakin' and I'm broken in a young world 
(So true, so true, listen) 
I wasn't tryin' to lead her on 

See I didn't wanna be alone 
But when she smiles she brought me home 
So I brought her home, 
It's not that the feelin' of love is gone 

Can't expect a kind little girl to be grown 
I can't give a fuck what so and so says 
Crushes hurt both ways 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
My heart was soakin' and I'm broken in a young world! 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?

Young 
Young girl, so in love with you
The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life

And I'm not lookin' around 
So why you lookin' down?
(What you lookin' down for?)
I fucked up a long time ago

See I should have never let you know 
See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say 
(As the People magazine) 
And crushes hurt both ways

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?

Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you 

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (HOV!) 

My heart was soakin' and I'm broken in a young world! 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (HOV!)
Young girl, so in love with you (HOV!)

(Jay-Z)

HOV got a young girl 
HOV got a young girl 
Still not quite 21 
So high strung 

Such a vibrant thing 
I introduce myself, hi Ms. Thing
You're 19? 
No, you're lighting in a bottle, I give you a ring tomorrow 

The scene that follows 
Screens of horror 
Classic Steven King novel 
Mamma don't think you should take someone so advanced in romance 

You should just wait 
Papa don't preach 
HOV don't bite 
Hopin' through it I might mo' your life 

'Cause imma show you right 
Proper etiquette how to hold your knife 
Keep it competitive with Oprah's ice 
Be like Janet, take control of your life 

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(Young girl) 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do? (young girl) 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?

(Young girl) 
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 
(Young girl) 
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! 

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(Too young, I'm never top young) 
Young girl, so in love with you 
('Cause I'm never too young) 

What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(Too young, I'm never too young) 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?

('Cause I'm never too young) 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
(Too young, I'm never too young) 
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do 

('Cause I'm never too young!) 
My heart was soakin' and I broken in a young world! 
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do?
Young girl, so in love with you 
(This is where the story begins baby)
