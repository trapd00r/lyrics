I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up in the heaven, Lord I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white:
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeh, uh-uh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

Everybody's dancing down local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeh, uh-uh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

Turn on channel six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife says "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, break out them rocking shoes"

Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeh, uh-uh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

Then God way up in Heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and rolling music meets the rising, shining sun

Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
Yeh, uh-uh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night
