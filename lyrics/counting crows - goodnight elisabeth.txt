I was wasted in the afternoon,
Waiting on a train,
I woke up in pieces and Elisabeth,
Had disappeared again,
I wish you were inside of me,
I hope that you're okay,
I hope you're resting quietly,
I just wanted to say.

Good, goodnight Elisabeth,
Goodnight Elisabeth, goodnight,
Good, goodnight Elisabeth,
Goodnight Elisabeth, goodnight.

We couldn't all be cowboys,
Some of us are clowns,
Some of us are dancers on the midway,
We roam from town to town,
I hope that everybody,
Can find a little flame,
And me, I say my prayers,
Then I just light myself on fire,
And I walk out on the wire once again,
And I say.

Good, goodnight Elisabeth,
Goodnight Elisabeth, goodnight,
Good, goodnight Elisabeth,
Goodnight Elisabeth, goodnight.

Well I will wait for you in Baton Rouge,
I'll miss you down in New Orleans,
I'll wait for you while she slips in something comfortable,
And I'll miss you when I'm slipping in between,
But if you wrap yourself in daffodils,
I will wrap myself in pain, oh,
And if you're the queen of California,
Baby I am the king of the rain,
And I say.

Good, goodnight Elisabeth,
Goodnight Elisabeth, goodnight,
Good, goodnight Elisabeth,
The moon, the satellites,
Yeah well.

Wouldn't you fall down on me now,
Wouldn't you fall down on me now,
Come, come fall down on me now,
Wouldn't you fall down on me.

'Cause I'm all alone, you ain't coming home,
You just settle down, down, down, in to bone,
Yeah I said I'm all alone, you ain't coming home,
We just settle down, down, down, in to bone.
