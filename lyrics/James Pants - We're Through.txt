Baby, sweet little angel
My lord!

Let me tell ya baby what you mean to me
Let me tell ya baby what you mean to me
When you get time, you're all right

Hot pants, you see, I need 'em in the mornin'
To fill me up all though the day
I need them in the evenin'
To tighten my game on my man
Can't do without it, you know I love it

Hey, hey, hey-y-y-y-y-y-y
Hot pants, when I need 'em
Hot pants, when I want 'em
Hot pants, I gotta have it

Gotta have it
Baby, can't do without it
Stronger lovin', fighter lovin'
I need it, I need it, I need it

A two-faced woman and a devil's man
Cause all the troubles from above again
A two-faced woman and devil's man
Snaggin' through the towers will make you mad
Don't change it, got to rearrange it

Hot pants will make the difference
Will make the difference
Will make the difference
Will make the difference
Whoa! Stop the bus. Ha
You need someone to love ya
You need someone that they can have ya
