Sun is the reason
And the world it will bloom
Cause sun lights the sky
And the sun lights the moon

Sun is the reason
All the happy trees are green
Then who can explain
The light in your dream

Sit you down
Sit you down young gentlemen
There's something I want you to know
You keep on asking me
You keep on asking me why
Why are we here?
It started a long time ago
Me and your mum on the night
Yeah Yeah Yeah ...we met

I was on the road again
She was in C79
Ill never never forget
Ill never forget that night no...

We met in a back road
Behind the stage
She had the best figure by far
Huh a thousand hours I've looked at her eyes but I
Still don't know what colour they are
Me and your mum on the night
Oh Lord. We met

I was on the road again
She was in C79
She was a junkie then
And I was having a good time
Back on the road again

Oh momma I was on the road again
Back in suite 79
Ill never never forget
Ill never forget that time
Back on the road again
Oh I'm travelling that line
I was a pop star then
I'm still having a good time
