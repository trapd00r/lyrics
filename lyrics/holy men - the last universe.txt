Acid rain spread the pain
Where are our gods?
We demand our death

There is no tale of death
Smoke provokes the endless night
We're paying for the human sins
Burned, blinded, creepin' unerground

I can hear
The babies screaming
Mutilated
Searching for an answer

Politicians make the final call
Always winners wrote these tales
Unfertil wombs are bleeding 'til death
Black clouds are hiding our sun

Chorus:
My sweat now is putrid greed
Amorphous creatures walk the eternal night
Cries from the black book of doom
The holy bible and science were not the answer

Across the river
Of my turbid memories
I can't forget
Their faces on tv

Politicians make the final call
Always winners wrote these tales
Unfertil wombs are bleeding 'til death
Black clouds are hiding our sun

That's was a war
That they'll repeat
As soon as they can
From their safe refuges

There is no tale of death
Smoke provokes the endless night
We're paying for the human sins
Burned, blinded, creepin' unerground


Chorus:
My sweat now is putrid greed
Amorphous creatures walk the eternal night
Cries from the black book of doom
The holy bible and science were not the answer
