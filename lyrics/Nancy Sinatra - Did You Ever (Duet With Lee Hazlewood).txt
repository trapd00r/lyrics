Did you ever?
Not so much, that you can know this
Could you ask maid how many?
8 or 9
Will you do it anymore?
As soon as you walk out the door
Well I just wonder, did you ever?
All the time

Could I fix you once more?
No thanks I just had one
Then how about a nice big..
That will just be fine
Is there any special way
No, whatever you say
Well I just wonder, did you ever?
All the time

Does he look like
NO he taller and more handsome
Yeah but he is old 
Oh no heâs young and heâs in his prime
Does your father know of it
Hmm. Hmm.. I havenât told him yet
I just wonder, did you ever?
All the time

But just for all time sake
That will be much harder
Then how about 
Well are you sure you donât mind

Iâm afraid Iâll miss my bus
I just wonder, did you ever?
All the time
