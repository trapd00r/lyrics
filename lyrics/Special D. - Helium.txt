I used to feel blue, my hopes became true 
How long have I searched for someone like you 
No minute goes by, just a notion of you 
I still get down and that's really true 

How long have I searched for you, for someone like you

(2x)
I used to feel blue, my hopes became true 
How long have I searched for someone like you 
No minute goes by, just a notion of you 
I still get down and that's really true 

Alright, now listen
Ladies and Gentlemen
Special D
Oh my God

You, uhh, heey, you

You're the only one I need
You're my angel, you're my love
You're the air I need to breath
You're my ever shining star (I love you)
All I think about is you

(2x)
I used to feel blue, my hopes became true 
How long have I searched for someone like you 
No minute goes by, just a notion of you 
I still get down and that's really true 

For someone like you
You, heey
You, I love you
