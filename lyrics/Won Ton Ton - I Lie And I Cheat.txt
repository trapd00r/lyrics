Every now and then I think about my life
I see it around me and smile
What a happy life I got till now
Till now

Every night I sleep well and I dream
I dream about everything I'm not
Ooh, I'm not a loser

'Cause I lie and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feet, boy
I lie and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feet, boy

Every now and then you give me flowers
Mostly the morning after
To show me that I was wrong
So wrong

It took me one hundred years to find you
It's sad I admit
But I can't quit

'Cause I lie and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feet, boy
I lie and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feet, boy

Every now and then you blow me a kiss
But then you blew it, with your fist
Pride makes me bear these bruises
When you grin
No roses without thorns

'Cause I lie and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feet, boy
I lie and I cheat
That's why I lay down at your feet, boy

I'm a liar, I'm a cheater,
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater,
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater,
I'm a liar,
I'm a cheater,
I'm a liar,
I'm a cheat, I'm a cheat, I'm a cheater,

Every now and then I think about my life...
