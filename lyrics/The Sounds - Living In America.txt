Teenage pornstars
Living for nothing now
Nightlife baby
Oooh-aah-ooh
Look out, shape up
Boy you got to turn around
And wake up honey
Oooh-aah-ooh

We're not living in America,
But we're not sorry
I knew there was something that we never had,
We don't worry
No we're not living in America,
But we're not sorry
No we don't care about the world today
We're not sorry for you

Pretty as a picture, dancing the night away
Don't stop baby
Oooh-aah-ooh
I've learned my way
I'm living for something now
It's hardcore honey
Oooh-aah-ooh

We're not living in America,
But we're not sorry
I knew there was something that we never had,
We don't worry
No we're not living in America,
But we're not sorry
No we don't care about the world today
We're not sorry for you

We're not living in America (x9)
We're not living in America
But we're not sorry
I knew there was something that we never had
We don't worry
No we're not living in America,
But we're not sorry
No we don't care about the world today
We're not sorry for you
My baby, sweet baby
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, aah
