Authors & Composers : Thomas G:son & Henrik Sethsson

I wanna know
What you feel inside
Is something wrong
Why did you leave last night
Is it all just a game
Oh, tell me why we can't be lovers

I do believe
In the two of us
That you and me
We are the only ones
And we were meant to be true
So, tell me why we can't be lovers

How could I be such a fool
I thought I already knew it all, but I know
I was totally wrong

CHORUS :

Listen to your hearbeat
It will take you higher
Follow your emotions
I know you'll get stronger

Listen to your heartbeat
Your feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion
I know it's inside you

How will I know
If you're fooling me
Maybe I'm wrong
But it seems, to be like
it's all just a game
And I just want us to be lovers

We had it all in our hands
Just like those all happy ends
I still don't know why
But we lost it somehow

CHORUS

One more chance to make a try
Nothing left to do for you and I

CHORUS

Listen to your heartbeat
