Touch! 
Do you need it more than I do 
Whenever we meet when we've been apart
Yea, I need a hand to hold on to, 
Need to hear every beat of your heart
And when we're dancing close together 
And the music turns real slow 
There's one thing on my mind I just wanna know

Can you feel, can you see, can you touch me? 
Can I give you the love that's inside of me? 
Can I take your heart with me? 
Do you know me enough to give it all up? 

And the the beat goes on forever, 
Boy meet a girl and they fall in love
And we're walking home together
Time, only time - oh there isn't enough! 
And when we're making love together 
And you let your feelings show 
There's one thing on my mind 
I just got to know

Can you feel, can you see, can you touch me? 
Can I give you the love that's inside of me? 
Can I take your heart with me? 
Do you know me enough to give it all up? 
Do you know me enough to give it all?
