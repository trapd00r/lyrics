Jenny Mattress is a friend of mine

enny Mattress is on her way down

he's a living love machine

enny Mattress

an you really feel the light

hen you're lying in your bed

ate at night

ith the fattest ugliest man

ou've ever seen

t least you can pretend

hat there's a life

fter you've been born

ven if you saw what you saw,

hat the class-distinction

s as big as high and low

hy Jenny why,

'm too near the border

hy Jenny why,

'm stuck in this line

hy Jenny why

 can't take orders

hy Jenny why,

 don't really want my life

enny Mattress

an't you see the danger

h Jenny you just can't win

ou're a woman you shall be quiet

hen he locks you in

nd if he ain't paying you

ust let him go

e can beat you up,

o so much more

ou are quiet, as a living wall

t least you can pretend

hat there's life

fter that you've been born

ven if we ain't living

y the same laws

t's easy to rule you

hen you too small
