Artist: bad meets evil (eminem and royce the 5-9)
[royce] what?  uhh..
[em] the bad..
[royce] yeah..
[em] the evil..
[royce] right, yo
[em] put em together

Chorus: royce the 5-9, eminem

[royce] yo if it wasnât for your whip, Iâd have nothin to strip
[em] if it wasnât for a wrist, Iâd have nothin to slit
If it wasnât for the shrooms, Iâd have nothin to chew
[royce] yo..
[both] Iâm just fuckin with you, cause I got nothin to do

[eminem]
I am bored!!!!!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors dâoeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while Iâm rippin your wallet off
And slippin a molotov in your cocktail (take that)
Burnin your contracts, punch your a&r in the face *punch sound*
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
Iâm on some shook shit, if itâs missin I took it (whoops!)
Nurse look at this straightjacket, itâs crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (fedex)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head
When the rest of his bodyâs still alive runnin? 

[royce]
Comin with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what? ) hide from it
For every hundred mcâs rhymin about birds
Only about two-thirdsâd really set it without words
Yo you ainât a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear itâs rainin slugs (what? )
Iâm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The bad and evil mad rap, I cover the bad half
You know how a thug in this shitâll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what? )
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Chorus: 2x

[eminem]
*yawns* forget a chorus -- my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
And by the time you all catch on, iâma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on!
Iâll throw you off of ten floors .. *ahhhhhhh*
Pull a fuckin headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
Iâm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, it oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch?  no, but I brought a napkin
Gettin skullie while Iâm autographin
Got my daughter laughin cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin
Iâm not a fact, iâma proven fear
Mr. rogers blocked up my u-haul screamin,
Wait, wait, wait.. you ainât movin here!
Lorena bobbitt, câmere, want a souveneir? 
Iâve been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile?  same difference -- I need some âcaine
Cause I ainât sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(oh my god!) brain implants and they say thereâs a slim chance
I wonât stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanzâ

[royce]
Walkin in swamp water with an m-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
Iâll display hate and break you in eight places (what? )
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the devil leadin - I wonât die, Iâm never leavin (what? )
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts, what?  my meatâs bigger (what? )
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinkin Iâm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what? )
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

Chorus 2x

[em] the bad.. the evil..
The bad.. the evil..
