(Feat. Dr. Dre)

(Dr. Dre)
Journey with me into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mindset
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, lights out
'Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggaz get hauled off

(haha) Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin flesh
Barrel two
Shoots your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool it's your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitation I ain't hesitatin
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a .44 mag
And you're frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this graveyard filler cap peeler
'Cause I'm a natural born killa

(Ice Cube)
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma 'cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker (Yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm bustin' a nut when I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
'Cause I'm givin' dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
Cause evertime you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how you're livin'
I'm the unforgivin
Psycho drivin'
Murdera
Its authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
Ill snatch him out of his truck
Hit 'em with a brick
And I'm dancin

(RBX)
Mass Murderer, Natural Born Killla,
And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna
I don't wannaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa die!

(Ice Cube)
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of sirens
Terrified screams from the streams of strychnine
Dumpin on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine
Cause motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain, migraine, headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

(Dr. Dre)
Tic Toc Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keepin' niggaz in order makin' their live shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallicinatin, ain't no debatin
I'm creatin' an escape route to be out without a doubt
Scot free, so don't even think about tryin' to stop me
'Cause I can't wait I'm out the gate 
On the for realla, A thrilla from a natural born killa

(Ice Cube)
Gi-gi gi-gi gaga
They call me dada
6 million ways to murder
Choose one
Lose one soul
Bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggaz goin' bump in the night...
