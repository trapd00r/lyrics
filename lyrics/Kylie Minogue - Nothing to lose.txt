Gotta make a move
Got everything to gain
And nothing to lose
Ah - nothing to lose

Gotta take a chance
Gotta make a move
Got everything to gain
And nothing to lose
Ah - nothing to lose
Everything to gain
And nothing to lose

Gotta take a chance
Gotta make a move
Got everything to gain

Ah - nothing to lose
Everything to gain
And nothing to lose

I won't share you
With any other girl
'Cause I've got my pride, I've

Gotta take a chance
Gotta make a move
Got everything to gain
And nothing to lose
Ah - nothing to lose
Everything to gain
And nothing to lose
