Some try to warn be 'bout your acting skills
They say there's a method in the way you feel
The void you so desperately try to soothe
So give me a drink before I love you too

It only takes fifteen if you take in account
The last five minutes you just didn't count

Someone else just took your place
Same old story 'bout a different face
I'm not gonna wait till you say farewell
Please, please don't be yourself

It only takes fifteen if you take in account
The last five minutes you just went around
It only takes fifteen if you take in account
The last five minutes you just didn't count

Some... classes in the... school
And they only make sense if you play by the rules
And don't forget to compromise
I'm not sure that you realise

It only takes fifteen if you take in account
The last five minutes you just went around
It only takes fifteen if you take in account
The last five minutes you just didn't count
