Brenda's
Got a (Baby)
Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought-my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out, and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
And yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,
Whatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so
She didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'
Mama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'
Brenda wants to run away, Mama say
You making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday
Now, Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby

Baby
