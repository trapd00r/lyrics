I wish that I was older
Old enough to be yours, mhmm
And I wish that I was wiser
Wise enough to be strong-minded
To keep up with the words you say
That make me feel so young

But I don't know where this is going
I've just been hoping
And I can see by your smile
That you're glowing inside and out
Let's not pretend like it's not what it is
When I'm just starting to realise
That I love you, ooh

And I wish that we were strangers
Strange enough to go unnoticed from this crowd
And I wish that we were closer
Close enough for me to hold you
When your lonely nights become too long to bear

But I don't know where this is going
I've just been hoping
And I can see by your smile
That you're glowing inside and out
Let's not pretend like it's not what it is
When I'm just starting to realise
That I love you, ooh

You hold your head up high
Though it's hard to, ooh
I can't keep back
I know I just want you, ooh

But I don't know where this is going
I've just been hoping
And I can see by your smile
That you're glowing inside and out
Let's not pretend like it's not what it is
When I'm just starting to realise
That I love you, ooh

I love you...
