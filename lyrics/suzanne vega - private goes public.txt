Smile no smile
On this face today
Jerk like a thing on a string
And go join the parade

Code will keep your privacy in
It won't help to win friends
Influence strangers
Or otherwise be in the swim

Mask will keep your features in check
Cause face is the place
Where the private goes public
And steps through the gate

Take your last kick now
At any regime
Smile no smile
See if they see what you mean

Da da daâ€¦
