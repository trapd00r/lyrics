Buzzbomb, buzzbomb, macho mobile
The road's my slave, that's how I feel
I cruise alone, I cruise real far
I don't love you, I love my car

'Cross Nevada at 110
Highway 50 and there's nobody there
Sign says "Next Sign: 30 Miles"

I work all week, each penny saved buys more escape from home
I'd rather cruise around all day than save up for a move
Plow through rest area san-o-lets
Splat goes the lonely salesman wanking in the men's room

Buzzbomb, buzzbomb, tape up loud
Blue piss clinging to my windshield
Faster, faster in my car

Buzzbomb is my pride and joy, king of the trailer court
Waiting for the perfect chick who'll love me for my car
I tell her why I'm cool, she coos back just what I like
When I pretend she's near

Zip through Ely where Pat Nixon was born
Cops 'round here sure looking bored
Flashing lights, state patrol

They're scratching up my gorgeous paint job
Shooting at my tires
Ain't no way to go to heaven
Buzzbomb cornered at the 7-11
