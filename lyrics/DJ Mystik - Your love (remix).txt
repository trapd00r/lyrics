Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick
I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashbacks, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you said
And you say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time

And you say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time

Time after....
