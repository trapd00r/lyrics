Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you

Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road with my head in my hand
I'm lookin' for a woman needs a worried man
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just one more chance

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your aeroplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train

Well, I've been lookin' all over for a gal like you
I can't find nobody, so you'll have to do
There's just one kind favor I'll ask you
Allow me just one more chance

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you

Well, lookin' for a woman that ain't got no man
Is just lookin' for a needle that is lost in the sand
Just one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just one more chance
