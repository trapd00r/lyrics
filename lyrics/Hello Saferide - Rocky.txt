They spoke to you in terms of "don't"
They used five words or less
They never asked you how you felt
Where we come form, we drink or we suppress

When you cried at two, they smiled at you
Said "Measure up now, little one"
And in school, you bit your lip
When you were hit behind the buildings

Kids tried real hard to make you cave but you didn't
You hit back
It was your reputation's birthday
When they yelled Rocky at you
Because of the punches you threw
Rocky, Rocky
They wanted to be like you

There was discomfort
When emotion started sipping out at inappropriate times
It felt safer to keep it locked up inside
Felt safer to sleep with teeth grinding at nights

Grinding your teeth, lalalalalalala
Grinding, lalalalalalale
Grinding, you were just like me

But then it happened, something bad
Made something grow inside of you like a volcano
And it was too big to control
You tried to run away but it ran after you

You're scared as shit as you're letting go
But as you do I love, I love, I love
I love you more

Rocky, you're a human now
Society tried to smother you
But never could
Caged up men everywhere
Led to believe that weakness is not a strength
You must lead them now, you must lead them

I loved you before
But now when you lay your head on my lap
And you say it's too much
I love you more

I loved you before but now
When you're arming up to fight your own head
I love you more

I loved you before but now
When you're speaking like you're not sure
I love you more

I loved you before I love you Rocky
I love you more

When you put down your gloves
Let us share the pants
You can carry my load
And I'll carry yours

I love you more
When you're speaking like you're not sure
I love you more

I loved you before but now
When you're arming up to fight your own head
I love you more

I loved you before I love you Rocky
I love you more

When you put down your gloves
Let us share the pants
You can carry my load
And I'll carry yours

I love you more
When you're speaking like you're not sure
I love you more

I loved you before I love you Rocky
I loved you before I love you Rocky
I loved you before I love you Rocky
