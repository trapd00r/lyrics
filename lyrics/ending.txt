We're at the end of the line
She keeps me from closing my eyes
Keeps me from sleeping at night
Don't let me go

We've been talking a while
Looking at everything bright
Wrote, and she asked me, I'm fine
Just don't let me go

There came a time
When you were the only one
You were the only one
The only one

Maybe I could be your only price
Maybe you could light it white
Even when I'm falling back
You'd still believe I tried
Maybe we could be a symphony
And maybe I could learn to play
You could write that story
While I just ride the wave

We're at the end of the line
She keeps me from holding her tight
Trying to make sure she's fine
Don't let me go

We took hundred steps back
How you said "goodbye" was sad
Now when I think of it I...
Please let me go

There came a time
When you were the only one
You were the only one
The only one

Maybe I could be your only price
And maybe you would light it white
Even when I'm falling back
You'd still believe I tried
And maybe we could be a symphony
And maybe I could learn to play
You could write that story
While I just ride the wave

But life is never like that
But life is never like that
She took me in and now I feel still
No, life's never like that
Life's never like that
Life's never like that

Maybe I could be your only price
Maybe you would light it white
Even when I'm falling back
You'd still believe I tried
Maybe we could be a symphony
And maybe I could learn to play
You could write that story
While I just ride the wave

While I just ride the wave
