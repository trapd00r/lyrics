Mm mm mm mm mm mm

What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
But what if it don't?
What happens in my head stays in my head
But sometimes it won't
What if you knew what I was thinking?
Would it make you like "Whoa!"?
I don't wanna risk
Putting my foot in this
So I keep my mouth closed

All you hear is mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gonna button my lip
So the truth don't slip
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gotta beep out
What I really wanna shout
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out?
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisies

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Some of my feelings keep escaping
So I make it a joke
Nonchalant I keep on faking
So my heart don't get broke
I'm in a big big big big ocean
In a tiny little boat
I'll only put the idea out there
If I know it's gonna float

All you hear is mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gonna button my lip
So the truth don't slip
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gotta beep out
What I really wanna shout
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out?
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisies

'Cause in my head
There's a slot machine
And I'm betting you're the one
In my hopes and dreams
(La la la la la)
(La la la la la la la)
(La la la la la)
(La la)
(La la)

Trust me it would scare you
If you knew what was going on in my brain
Trust me it would scare you
That I picked out the church or the schools or the names
If you knew it was all about you
(La la la la la)
Every wish, every candle, every coin in the fountain
(La la la la la la la)
Trust me it'd scare you
(La la la la la)
(La la)
(La la)

That's why I go
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm yeah

All you hear is mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gonna button my lip
So the truth don't slip
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gotta beep out
What I really wanna shout
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out?
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisies

Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gonna button my lip
So the truth don't slip
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Gotta beep out
What I really wanna shout
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Whoops! Did I say it out loud?
Did you find out?
I wanna have your babies
Get serious like crazy
I wanna have your babies
I see 'em springing up like daisies

Oh I wanna have your babies
Oh yeah
