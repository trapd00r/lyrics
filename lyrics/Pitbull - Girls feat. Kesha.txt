[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh

[Flo Rida:]
I-I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it
Glass to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right vibe
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jumping nose dive
Surfing the crowd

Ooh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it
And y'all get loose loose
After bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break rules cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models

[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh

[Flo Rida:]
Party rocker, for show stopper
More Chambull
Number-one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars

So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof

All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Round up baby tilt the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show

I like 'em untamed, don't tell me how pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, call my homie then we hit Spain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh

[Bridge:]
I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And I'm on the prowl

I show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body
Dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff

[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh

I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And I'm on the prowl
