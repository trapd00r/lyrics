He's gone two thousand miles
It's very far
The snow is falling down
Gets colder day by day
I miss you

The children will sing
He'll be back at Christmas time
In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in the dream, you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
Our hearts were all singing
It felt like Christmas time

Two thousand miles
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Wherever you go

He's gone two thousand miles
It's very far
The snow is falling down
Gets colder day by day
I miss you

I hear people singing
It must be Christmas time
I can hear people singing
It must be Christmas time
