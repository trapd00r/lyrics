Maxine Schreck was a very lucky lady
Maxine Schreck was a very lucky girl
Who you wanna be
Maxine Schreck
Who you wanna see
Maxine Schreck

Have you got some time, have you got some spine
Have you got something to begin with
Or are you in a sinwich

Have you got some nerve, have you got some verve
Have you got something to depend on
Or do you fender bend on

And if you say no
Do you mean to go
Down below the earth with nothing

Now you've got my name, and you've got my fame
Have you got something to remind you
Of who you used to be
Or are you happy being me

Moonlight and roses
Starlight and fairytales that won't come true
Good news for those who pine away
The day comes shinin' through

Kittens high-hattin', sittin' on satin
With a host who's catnip fond
For those who seize the day
The way is paved beyond-er

I didn't know the world was like this
If I'da known, then I'd be psychic
If I had a clue
Then maybe I'd be blue as a mockingbird
Why do you think she laughs so much

I didn't know I had such problems
If I'da known, then I'da solved them
But looking down the road
The Oklahoma toad's beckoning to me
