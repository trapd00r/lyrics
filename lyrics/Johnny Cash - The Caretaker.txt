I live in the cemetery ol' caretaker they call me 
In the wintertime I rake the leaves and in the summer I cut the weeds 
When a funeral comes the people cry and pray 
They bury their dead and they all go away 
But through their grief I still can see their hate and greed and jealousy 
So here I work and I somehow hide from a world that rushes by outside 
And each night when I rest my head I'm contented as the peaceful death 
But who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies 
Once I was a young man dashing with the girls 
Now no one wants an old man I lost my handsome curls 
But I wanna say when my time comes lay me facing the rising sun 
Put me in the corner where where I buried my pup 
Tell the preacher to pray then cover me up 
Don't lay flowers where my head should be maybe God let some grow for me 
And all the little children that I love like my own 
Will they be sorry that old John's gone 
Who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies
