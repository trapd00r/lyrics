You're cruel, device 
Your blood, like ice 
One look, could kill 
My pain, your thrill 

I wanna love you but I better not touch 
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop 
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison 
You're poison running through my veins 
You're poison 
I don't wanna break these chains 

Your mouth, so hot 
Your web, I'm caught 
Your skin, so wet 
Black lace, on sweat 

I hear you calling and its needles and pins 
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name 
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin 
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison 
You're poison running trough my veins 
You're poison 
I don't wanna break these chains 

Running deep inside my veins 
Poison burning deep inside my veins 
One look, could kill 
My pain, your thrill 

I wanna love you but I better not touch 
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop 
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison 
You're poison running trough my veins 
You're poison 
I don't wanna break these chains 

Poison 

I wanna love you but I better not touch 
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop 
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison 
You're poison running trough my veins 
You're poison 
I don't wanna break these chains 

Poison
