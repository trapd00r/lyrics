[Shane:]
Day after day
Time passed away
And I just can't get you off my mind
Nobody knows, I hide it inside
I keep on searching but I can't find

[Mark:]
The courage to show to letting you know
I've never felt so much love before

[All (Shane lead):]
And once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

[All:]
But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? ([Shane:] oh yeah)
How will I know
[Shane:] if I let you go?

[Bryan:]
Night after night I hear myself say
Why can't this feeling just fade away
There's no one like you (no one like you)
You speak to my heart (speak to my heart)
It's such a shame we're worlds apart

[Shane:]
I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose
But sooner or later I gotta choose
And once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

[All:]
But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be, holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (oh yeah)
How will I know
[Shane:] if I let you go ?

[Shane:]
If I let you go ooooh baby
Ooooooooohhhhh

[Bryan:]
Once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out
Ooooooooohhhhh

[All:]
But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be, holding you close to me
([Mark:] close to me)
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
([Shane:] oh yeah)
How will I know
([Bryan:] if I let you go?)
But if I let you go I will never know
([Mark:] oh baby)
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
([Shane:] oh yeah)
How will I know
[Shane:] if I let you go ?
