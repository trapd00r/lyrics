Music not easy to make it
But easy for you just to take it
Music gonna make you sweat
Here we go well get rock and wet
Music gonna make you jumping
Let the rhythm making you pumping
Music every day and night
Makes you happy and stop the fight
Music is in your place
I'm back again to start this race
Music is getting in your feet
Here we go again with the beat
Music makes me feel so proud
Mr. DJ play it loud
Music they only choice
So everybody get make some noise
Music not easy to make it
But easy for you just to take it
Music gonna make you sweat
Here we go well get rock and wet
Music gonna make you jumping
Let the rhythm making you pumping
Music every day and night
Makes you happy and stop the fight
