Trailer for sale or rent rooms to let fifty cents
No phone no pool no pets I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah but two hours of pushing broom buys a eight by twelve four bit room
I'm a man of means by no means king of the road

Third bocxcar midnight train destination Bangor Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes I don't pay no union dues

I smoke old stogies I have found short but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means king of the road
I know every engineer on every train all of the children and all of their names
Every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around
I sing trailer for sale or rent...
