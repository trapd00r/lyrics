[Beyoncé]
There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second and every minute another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up and here me sing
Stand up for love

[Kelly]
I'm inspired and hopeful each and everyday
That's how I know that things are gonna change

So how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second and every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up for love

[Michelle]
And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stand up
And the rest will follow
For all the forgotten
For all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song

And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life [Kelly]
Stand up and sing [Michelle]
Stand up for love [Beyoncé]
For love
For love
