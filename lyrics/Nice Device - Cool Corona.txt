Here we go, me and my babe got my ticket
To go to the valley and rub up a squicket
Yesterday she told me now I'm mad
I got to take it throught the add for my dad

Oh, no, no chance to escape
'Cause a muscle a job is a dad of my babe
What I wonder, girl, didn´t have a choice
But to marry his daughter and a frightening voice

Want me to act like the king of them all?
Want me to look like Elvis on the wall?
Want me to act like I'm ten feet tall?
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, got my head against the wall

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?
Shut the bona, give me a cool Corona

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?
Shut the bona, give me a cool Corona

Doin' the bus and oh, let's swing that back again
Enter the vehicle, we got the number nine and ten
We might went down but show us to begin
We faced the stage, I saw that it was him

Elvis the pelvis, my dear beloved friend
I buy a crocket valley, but made me sleep at then
A nightmare of phantoms in his limousine
Show me around Graceland i memory of he

She coloured my hair in an impressive way
Tryin' so hard to make the memory stay
I wait by a bush in my side
She looked very angry, then she cried

How could you do this to me?

Take a grasp

How could you mess this up, now off your friends

Why don´t you...

Shut up, you greatest life of all!

Oh Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, my head against the wall

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?
Shut the bona, give me a cool Corona

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?
Shut the bona, sing it, baby

Come on
Come on, fellows, one, two

My only escape is to drink cool Corona
I get my satisfaction while I'm drinking cool Corona
Corona, Corona, save me from my dona
You're my last hope, sweet cool Corona

Yeah, that's right
That's what I need right now
A cool Corona

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?
Shut the bona, give me a cool Corona

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?
I said stop, give me a cool Corona

Oh, shut up
I can't take this anymore
LIsten to her
Oh, she's like a nightmare

Listen up
The only reason I'm together with you is because of your dad
Can't you understand that?

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?
Would you be like Elvis?

Would you be like Elvis?
And could you look like Elvis?
And could you dance like Elvis?

I can't take this anymore
