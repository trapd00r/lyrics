He can only hold her for so long 
The lights are on, but no one's home 
She is so vacant, her soul is taken 
He thinks: "What she's running from?"

Now, how can he have her heart 
Oh when it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies (never dies, woohoo)

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

Now, how can he have her heart 
Oh when it got stole
So he tries to pacify her 
'Cause what's inside her never dies (never dies)

So he tries to pacify her 
'Cause what's inside her, it never dies, woahoo
So he tries to pacify her 
But what's inside her never dies (da, da, da, da, wooh)
