Tell me something true
Said it's gonna be okay
When the rain don't fall
Sitting on your roof
Baby we came a long way
Have you thought it through?

Don't leave me darling don't you need me?
California sun running on the repeat
Don't jinx this, darling we were restless
California sun running on the repeat

California sun running on the repeat
California sun, Cali-Cali-California sun

All that we got is a dream and Glock
And we don't believe anything that they say
'Cause we won't believe anything that they say

All that we need is to sweat a little, bleed
If we can't believe it then nobody gonna come
If we can't believe it then nobody gonna come

Don't leave me darling don't you need me?
California sun running on the repeat
Don't jinx this, darling we were restless
California sun running on the repeat

California sun running on the repeat
California sun, Cali-Cali-California sun

I'll, I'll love you till I die
Even if it's just a bold face hell of a pretty lie
And it's not like I could leave you, even if I try
You better know, b-better than that

Don't leave me darling don't you need me?
California sun running on the repeat
Don't jinx this, darling we were restless
California sun running on the repeat

California sun running on the repeat
California sun, Cali-Cali-California sun
