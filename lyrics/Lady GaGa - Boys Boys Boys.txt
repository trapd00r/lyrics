Hey there, sugar baby, saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock and roll
I like you a lot, lot
Think you're really hot, hot

Know you think you're special when we dance real crazy
Glamophonic, electronic, disco baby
I like you a lot, lot
All we want is hot, hot

Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

Ohh, oh oh oh, uh-ohhhh-oooo-wuh-ohh
Ohh, oh oh oh, uh-ohhhh-oooo-wuh-ohh

Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers
I like you a lot, lot
Think you're really hot, hot

Let's go to the party, heard our buddy's the DJ
Don't forget my lipstick, I left it in your ashtray
I like you a lot, lot
All we want is hot, hot

Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

I'm not loose, I like to party
Let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic
I like boys and that is that

Love it when you call me "legs"
In the morning, buy me eggs
Watch your heart when we're together
Boys like you love me forever

Ohh, oh oh oh, uh-ohhhh-oooo-wuh-ohh
Ohh, oh oh oh, uh-ohhhh-oooo-wuh-ohh
Ohh, oh oh oh, uh-ohhhh-oooo-wuh-ohh
Ohh, oh oh oh, uh-ohhhh-oooo-wuh-ohh

Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them
