And now it's time for the final dance
And we will be back here again, once more to listen to
And feel the uplifting sounds of our favorite DJ's
The Warp Brothers, we will survive

And now it's time for the final dance
It feels unnormal when it's coming, and don't breaks feelings
And believe, it's with my own bear hands
We will not lie down and die, we will fight
We will survive, we will survive
