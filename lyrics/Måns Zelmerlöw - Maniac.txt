Just a still town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real-time world
No one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing woman into life
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between 
Will and what will be

She's a maniac 
Maniac on the floor
(On the floor)
And she's dancing 
Like she's never danced before
(She's dancing likes...) 

She's a maniac 
Maniac on the floor
(On the floor)
And she's dancing 
Like she's never danced before
(Never danced before)

On the ice-build iron sanity 
Is a place most never see
It's a hard warm place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life 
For that moment in time
It could come or pass you by

It's a push of the world
But there's always a chance 
If the hunger stays the night

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between 
Will and what will be

She's a maniac 
Maniac I sure know
(I sure know)
And she's dancing 
Like she's never danced before
(She's danced before)

She's a maniac 
Maniac I sure know
(I sure know)
And she's dancing 
Like she's never danced before

She's a maniac 
Maniac I sure know
And she's dancing 
Like she's never danced before
(She's dancing likes...) 

She's a maniac 
Maniac I sure know
(I sure know)
And she's dancing 
Like she's never danced before
