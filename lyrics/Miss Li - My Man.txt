It's not that I'm a little jealous woman
But sure it's true, I never play to lose
And girl this is my last and final warning
What part of back off wasn't understood

Yes I've been sitting here now way to long girl
I've seen you waving with that long blond hair
I've seen your flirting and it gets me wrong
My man is not your little teddybear

And now you're sitting in my boyfriends lap
And I can see your arms are holding tight
I bet you think he's yours tonight
Girl you got to go now he's

My man, my man
Now leave him he is
My man, my man
Yeah back off he is
My man
Oh girl you got to go

I'm gonna solve this issue really smooth girl
I'm gonna be as nice as I can be
I'm sorry if I make you sad but
He's gonna drink his cup of tea with me

And now you're sitting in my boyfriends lap
And I can see your arms are holding tight
I bet you think he's yours tonight
But girl
Girl you got to go now he's

My man, my man
Now leave him he is
My man, my man
Yeah back off he is
My man
Oh girl you got to go

Girl you got to go
My man, my man
My man, my man
My man, my man
My man, my man
My man, my man
