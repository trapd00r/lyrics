[Verse 1: Entail]
Okay, I only lived in Cali for about two years
But I would really enjoy when I walked down the piers
Yeah, I've been gone so long now I can see clear
I plan on going out to party with all my peers
You know its going to be fun so heres
To our friends, just lift your coke can in the air and say cheers
So forget about your troubles and your fears
Cause Cali is the place where that stuff disappears
So...

[Hook]
Meet me out in Cali where the waves are crashing
Meet me out in Cali where the cameras flashing
I dont want to leave my mom alone
But theres no way I'm going home

Meet me out in Cali where they go to get famous
Meet me out in Cali where they go the in-sanest
Its all fun and ice cream cones
So theres no way I'm going home

[Verse 2: Z-Willie]
Uh-hu, yeah, we chilling out in Cali
Yeah we out the hills and we out the valleys
Maybe I just wanted to go and chill for a while
This ocean feels bigger than the freaking Nile

Man I ain't thinking about leaving
Being in the waves just got back in season
If I'm going back you better give me a reason
Otherwise I'll be where the wind is breezing
You can...

[Hook: Z-Willie]

[Verse 3: Z-Willie]
Oh, yes, its California baby
If you coming down here I'm warning You baby
You better bring tons of sunscreen and maybe
A couple thousand dollars in that pocket baby
And people down here go crazy
Blowing out their speakers to 2Pac lately
Maybe you can just relax and be lazy
Cause today feels like happiness and daisies

[Verse 4: Entail]
Rolling by in my convertible
This stuff that you ain't heard before
Its California, Breaking news
Got no one you can take this to
Chill with me in Malibu
You know me, and my crew
Spitting lines as sick as B.I.G. and 2
Want some proof
Well, maybe I can show you
But homie I don't even really know you
And we've been good, yeah, thats old news
Who needs proof, we just told you

[Hook: Entail]

[Verse 5: Entail]
Meet me out in Cali
Where the girls be all like wow Wade
Chilling, drinking coca-cola while I'm out just eating salad
You could say I'm a man of my trade
But I've gone so far and I've strayed
Now I don't care about what you've said
Im just me
So I'll be happy

I'm on my way up
Yup
I'll be there soon
Dont worry about me girl, I'll dine at noon
Just one thing left that I've got to do
Move out to California, party with you
