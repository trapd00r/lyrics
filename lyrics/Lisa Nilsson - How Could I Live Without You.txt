You're sending me flowers
You order champagne
I'm missing a date by hours
Leaving you in the rain
Sometimes loosing my patience
I keep talking too much
You appear with sophistication
You're my love you're my inspiration

How could I live without you
When I'm feeling this way
I'm so happy that I found you
Love you more every day

You treat me so tender
With diamonds and furs
But if choosing a gift or sender
I give up the purse
Thoose situation
Too me you're the one
Every day is a celebration
You're my love you're my inspiration

[x2]
How could I live without you
When I'm feeling this way
I'm so happy that I found you
Love you more every day

When I'm feeling
When I'm feeling this way
I'm so happy that I found you
Love you more every day

How could I live without you
When I'm feeling this way
I'm so happy that I found you
Love you more every day
