I'm so addicted to the lovin' that you're feeding me,
Can't do without it, this feeling's got me weak in the knees,
Body's in withdrawl, every time you take it away,
Can't you hear me callin',
Beggin' you to come out and play?

So baby come to me,
Show me who you are,
Sweet to me, like sugar to my heart,
I'm cravin' for you,
I'm missin' you like candy.

Sweet, sweet lovin'
Got me goin' to the extreme.
Wont go without it,
This vibe has got a hold on me,
Satisfyin' baby, let me show you what I'm made of,
No doubt about it boy, got me feelin' crazy, can't get enough.

Baby, baby, baby,
Wont you Come to me,
Show me who you are,
Sweet to me, like sugar to my heart.
I'm cravin' for you,
I'm missin' you like candy.

You know who you are,
Your love's as sweet as candy,
I'll be forever yours,
Love always, Mandy

So baby come to me,
Show me who you are,
Sweet to me, like sugar to my heart,
