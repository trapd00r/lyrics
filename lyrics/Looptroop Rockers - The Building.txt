Hey now I can't take another day
There's a feeling in the air and I can't find the words to say
Chaos in the building where we stay
We're living in a house that we can't wait to set in flames

Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Hey now, hey now, hey now

And I've never seen my neighbours from the top floor
But judging from the car they drive I know they're not poor
And I could be mistaken because I'm not sure 
But I got this little hunch they're the ones calling the cops
Four times last week saying I'm disturbing the peace
'Cos I was playing my music and they heard some loud screams
So my neighbour the cop who was suspect of beating his wife had to tell me to stop
And I wish I'd had the guts to tell him 'bout the noise from his apartment
But that's buisness I don't get involved with
So I look the other way, try to climb higher
'Cos if I reach the top I think I could escape the fire

Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Hey now, hey now, hey now

I wonder what you're doing tonight 
I wonder if you're free, ey, ey, ey
I think I hear my neighbours fighting through the thin walls
So what am I to do with tonight
How can I get free, ey, ey, ey
I'm bouncing on the walls like I'm a human pinball

Burn it down

I sit by my window see this kid on the corner hustle 
The belt wrapped around his knuckles ready to swing his the buckle
I'm thinking "Why are they fighting each other, they're in the same school"
They probably live next to each other under the same roof
I bet they're from my building, yeah, I bet that kid dad's
The drunk I pass on my way up the stairs, real sad
I'm sure they blame him for the tags in the hallway 
The robberies, not seeing, not seeing the reason he's outside all day
Like they came from nowhere with their bad intensions
They grew up in this place we made them who they are
I can see they're so scared could use some attention
This house can be a maze without a guiding star

Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Hey now, hey now, hey now

I wonder what they're doing tonight 
I wonder if they're free, ey, ey, ey
Burn it down
So what am I to do with tonight, burn it down
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Burn it
