I feel you

I feel you
In every stone
In every leaf of every tree
That you ever might have grown

I feel you
In everything
In every river that might flow
In every seed you might have sown

I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you

I feel you
In every vein
In every beating of my heart
Each breath I take

I feel you
Any way
In every tear that I might shed
In every word I've never said

I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you

I feel you
In every vein
In every beating of my heart
In every breath I ever take

I feel you
Any way
In every tear that I might shed
In every word I've never said

I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you

I feel you
