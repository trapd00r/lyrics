Like a movie scene,
in the sweetest dreams,
I have pictured us together,
Now to feel your lips,
on my fingertips, have to say is even better.
Then I never thought it could possibly be,
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness,
the tears that I've cried,
I have spent all of my life...

Waiting for tonight, oh,
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh,
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight.

Tender words you say, take my breath away,
Love me now and  leave me never.
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace,
I want to stay in this forever.
I think of the days when the sun used to set,
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed,
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong,
I knew I had to hold on...

Chorus

Gone are the days when the sun used to set,
On my empty heart all alone in my bed.
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong,
I knew I had to hold on...

Chorus (repeat 3 times)
