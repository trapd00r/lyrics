I don’t need no evidence
I’ve got my self confidence
So you don’t have to say a word
You don’t need to judge this girl

Come down you, you old teacher
And I´ll give, I´ll give you a lecture
Come down you, you old leader
Come and look what you’ve done
To my nation

Let’s call it self defence
A call for happy ending
But each side steps and says
Je regrette rien

Don’t say It
Don’t say you don´t regret a thing
Don’t say you don’t regret a thing
You could be my sister my brother and I
Won't let you go
Don’t say you don’t regret a thing
Don’t say you don’t regret a thing
But each side steps and said
Je regrette rien
Don’t say It
Je ne regrette rien..

Born in an haunted nation
Since when was War a passion
Born with a fighting rebound on them
Now look what it’s done
Done to our nations, lets say it
Let say it...

Don’t say you don´t regret a thing
Don’t say you don’t regret a thing
Don’t say you don’t regret a thing
You could be my sister my brother and I won't let you go

But each side steps and said
Je regrette rien
Don’t say it
Je ne regrette rien rien...
Don’t say it...
