The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
Full of magazines full clips and heavy metal
When the smoke settle, I'm just lookin' for a big yellow
And six inch stelletows
Dr. Dre (hello) perculatin' keep 'em waitin'
While you sittin' here hatin', your bitch is hyperventillatin'
Hopin' that we pentratin', you gets natin' 'cause I never been to Satan
The hardcore administrating gang bang affiliatin'
MC Ren will have you wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
(Get the dollar)
9 1 1 emergency
(And you can tell 'em)
It's my son he's hurtin' me
(And he's a felon)
On parole for robbery, ain't no copin' a plea, ain't no stopin' a G
I'm in the six you got to hop in the three, company monopoly
You handle shit slopilly I drop a key properly
They call me the Don Daada, pop a colla, drop a dolla if you hear me
You can hollar even rock wilders, folla, the impala
Want to talk about this concrete nigga I'm a scholar the incredible
Hetero-sexual, credible, beg a hoe, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit while you hand pick motherfuckers
Givin' up transcripts

Villain blows up your spot
Take your notebook your bitch and your glock
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
You slaped her ass that's alarming, 'cause she want my worm like Common
We chin check niggas, them thin check niggas run trains on goldiggers
Beware these four niggas, scare motherfuckers like Steven King flicks
Makin' niggas clear the room like a dike flea a dick
Make executive none shit, nigga like quick
So when I bomb first nigga who you rollin' with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck your fine ass bitch
'Cause you could loose it in a tussle nigga watch me hustle
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle, bitches
All in the back they knees waitin' to buckle
Same time same channel don't change the dial
Niggas for life, fuckin' your wife these niggas wild

Did I fall off?
Got you in your room rippin' every chronic poster on your wall off
Just 'cause I put away the sawed off
Now I got you sitin' back with a smirk listenin' with your arms crossed
Questioning Dre's credibility (What?)
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits, y'all be killin' me
As if I need to make mo'
I got a mansion and six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick
(Hello)
We came a long way from not giving a fuck
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck,
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker I'm Dre, I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album bitch I ain't gotta do shit
I do it because I want to not to stay in the game
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same lil' bitch!
