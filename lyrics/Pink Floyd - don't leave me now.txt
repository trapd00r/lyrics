Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now.
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you Babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now

How could you go?
When you know how I need you.1
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way
Running away
Ooooh Babe2
Why are you running away?

Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe

(Spoken) (Sound of many TV's coming on, all on different channels)
The Bulls are already out there...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh!
This Roman Meal bakery thought you'd like to know.3
