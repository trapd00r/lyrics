Guess who's back 
Back again 
Shady's back 
Tell a friend 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright Stop - Pajama time 

Come here little kiddies,On my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
no worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
what else could i possibly do to make noise 
Having touched on everything, but little boys 
That's not a stab at Micheal 
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good god, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide 
Up the center of the dance floor 
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go 
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little poot poot, it's ok
(Fart Sound)
Oops my CD just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip 

(Hook:)
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl - girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah 

It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday 
Crusin' on the freeway 
Feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there 
Someones gonna touch my body 
'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there 
What's your name girl 
What's your sign 
(Dr Dre:) Man, you must be up out your mind 
Dre - aah aah 
Beer goggles, blind 
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm

(repeat Hook)

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape 
Yelling at an old lady, 
"Touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
A step back to reality 
Look it's B.Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle 
I'm a grown man 
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Tubba Teletubbie
Fellas (what?) fellas (what?) 
Grab you left nut, make the right one jealous (what?) 
Black girls 
White girls 
Skinny girls 
Fat girls 
Tall girls 
Small girls 
I'm calling all girls 
Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance whore 
Butt squeezin' it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah 
so appeasing 

(repeat Hook)

Mmmmm touch my body 
Mmmmm touch my body 
Ooh boy just touch my body 
I mean girl just touch my body
