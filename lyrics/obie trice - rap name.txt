(Obie Trice)
Obie Trice: Real name, no gimmicks
Rap; I been in it ever since I was invented
That's cause a nigger live it
My records wield digits in history
Niggers, you be the witness
I got the white boys mad at me
Cause Em signed another black boy
Like he nigger happy
Caucasians, Marshall knows talent
Obie Trice a riot, that's why he's hired
I hit ya raves, balloons and E's
And bang all your European Pamela Lee's
Fuckin' aye, or how we say it round my way
'Fo sho', Trice gon blow, then I'm off to them shows
I'm off across the globe, until my accounts all swoll
For young Kobe - big things, act like ya know me
Not a soul can hold me, I'm here

[Eminem] That's why I ain't got no
[Obie] Rap Name
The name's ('Obie Trice')
('They see me on the streets
They be like 'Yo, he nice!')
So I came to the game
('Real name, no gimmicks')
Rap a livin'...

(Obie Trice)
It didn't take much - one hot single (BAM!)
Smiles and handshakes, my man
The industry greeted me with open arms
With no type of flak cause O. Trice got that
Fugaze y'all rap, who gave y'all dat?
New wave of mu-zack that you're all lovin'
Got your broads on my balls, huggin'
Even my next-of-kin's famous (Obie's your cousin?)
Please believe it
I'm as 'Down to Earth' as Chris Rock
Gettin' hit by trucks, starin' at twat
A big cannon in ya G-spot
Me, not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot
Whether or not you believe my status
I'm prepared to be the baddest
On the rap that's happenin'
Put the Mitten back on the map
With Mathers and win this

(Obie Trice)
Well, I'm drunk right now, but still I got a gun
Beef? (*cocked and two shots*) best-a run
'Cause when I pop, people's flesh get numb
And whoa... Ya might not make it till ya young
The only one with okay's, wanna blaze
Meet my little friends on racks in my den
Pull 'em out, that's when the action begins
And ya block, remind you of Mad Max the film
Deserted, that's word to vacant homes
2002 Trice up in ya headphones
[Eminem] If it's ya system
[Obie] Trice up in ya bows
[Eminem] If it's ya women
[Obie] Then Trice up in ya hoes!
I suppose that I am kinda cocky, when it's dealin'
With raps, chicks, and cats out to sock me
I handle it like Rocky, Jake Sneed
Rakim, Eric B. - O's a G!

{*Scratching*}
'Rap Name' ... 'Rap Name'...
'Rap Name'... 'Rap Name'...
'O-Obie Trice'
[Eminem] You-you-you can get stomped by Obie...
