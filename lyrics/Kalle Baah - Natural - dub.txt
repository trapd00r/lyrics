There she goes again, In the midst of all the hurdles
Of a hundred hungry men. who will never try to hurt her
They can see it in her eyes, that she's not the kind who rabble
She never tell no lies, to them who living in her bubble
Don't you realize, don't you realize
There is something in her eyes, that make you feel okey
No matter what they say, no matter what they say

When she hear them call, deep down from their hearts
She would never let them fall, only show them where to start

She never tell no lies, to them who live in her bubble
Don't you realize, don't you realize
There is something in her eyes, that make you feel okey
No matter what they say, no matter what they say
