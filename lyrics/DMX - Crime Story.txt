Mnn 
Man, uh 
Shit stay happen 
Ya know 
Its crazy dog 
Its off the hook 
But you know 
Real niggas survive 
No regardless 
Them heartless 

Who is this I see, comin' through, its like 3 
On the a.m., I'ma rob this nigga 
An when I'm done, I'ma slay him 
For bein' stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2 
And havin' a gun that he couldn't get to 
Yeah, that one'll do 
Foolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em 
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I leach 'em 
Like Jigga said, niggas test you 
When your gun goes warm 
So I keep 'em scattering 
Like roaches, when the light turns off 
From night to dawn 
Right from wrong 
Hope no way 
3-57 slugs with a snub nose, dray eight 
Settin' all you bitches straight (what) 
Squashin' all beefs 
To the point where the police 
Be blockin' all streets 
Got me trapped up in the building 
But you know how that go 
I stay fucking with the hood rats 
And I run up in the rab hole 
Run through the hallway 
See police, face to face 
And bein' I'm tellin' you this story 
Means I caught another case 

Its either you or me 
And more than likely, its gonna be you, than me 
Aiight? Feel me O 

Day 2 of the saga 
This fuckin' drama continues 
Wakin' up like every 2 hours, lookin' out my window 
Plus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door 
Just in case, when they bust in, I bust them 
And I'm gunnin' for the face 
"What a waste of potential" is what my teachers used to tell me 
"You can always get a job" and cheap shit they tried to sell me 
Got me no where but broke and fucked up in the game 
But now I got a name, and niggas know my name 
Knock of the door "police, we lookin' for a man 
Killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand" 
I play like a bitch "Its just me here, and I'm not dressed 
And that guy sounds kinda dangerous, I hope you make an arrest" 
That was a close one, now I know I gotta get outta the city 
Cuz I know I'm hotter than lave, I'm holla the mouth 
Got my dog on the horn, he like 
"Fuck, you done did it 
They a ran up in my crib, nigga, pattin down my kid" (dial tone) 

Put the harness on the dog, load up the weapons 
Murder's on my mind, no half steppin' 
Motherfuckers want war, you can get it, 
Cuz I'm tired of runnin', remember me as the nigga that died gunnin' 
Kamakaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest 
Run up in that joint, raw dog, fuck the vest 
They can keep theirs, cuz it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em 
It'll be the raw of the C-4 as I'm bringin' down the building 
When I go, taking a bunch of the motherfuckers with me 
I ain't sittin around 
waiting for them faggot niggas to come and get me 
I bring it to 'em, service with a smile 
What nigga? Didn't know a dog with rabies was up in the cut, nigga? 
Now that you finally findin' out what this shit means 
I'm at the precinct, 116th 
Run up in there 
Open up my jacket "You muthafuckers lookin' for me?
Well here I am now you comin' with me"
(Explosion) 

Man, that shit is crazy baby 
Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you feel it, is you wit it 
Its off the hook y'all
