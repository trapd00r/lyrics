A man is sifting though muddy water looking for what he can find
his character left shamed and bettered has lost the meaning in life
behind the face of reason is burning some kind of hell
the saving grace of one wrong man is somewhere lost in the fight

I walk over holy water
travel through the circles of love made it with the devil's daughters
I just cant find the stuff to be a holy man


The temperature that I feel is risigs its time to give in or fight
to say the least I will succueed or follow the guiding light

( chorus )

I walk over holy water 
travel through the circlos of love made it with the devil's daughters
Heaven you know that I've tired enagh

I walk over holy water
travel through the circlos of love made it with the devil's daughters
I just cant find the stuff to be a holy man
I dont wanna be will enough to be holy man
