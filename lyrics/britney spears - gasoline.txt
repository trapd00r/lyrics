Ooh, ooh, yeah
You're so bright, like a dream,
You burn up, everything,
We might, make a scene,
Ignite, gasoline.

When the music goes up,
And the sun goes down,
Lightening strikes and I'm on the ground,
Only one that I want around, (is you)

Yeah!
Spark and it's like Gasoline
I start pumping like a machine,
My heart only runs on supreme,
So hot, give me your gasoline,
Yeah...

You're setting me on fire,
You're setting me on fire,
You're setting me on fire,
Yeah...

You're setting me on fire,
You're setting me on fire,
You're setting me on fire,
Yeah...

Heatwave, on the floor,
Escape, exit door,
Your touch, burning me,
It's too much gasoline.

When the music goes up,
And the sun goes down,
Lightening strikes and I'm on the ground,
Only one that I want around, (is you)

Yeah!
Spark and it's like gasoline

I start pumping like a machine,
My heart only runs on supreme,
So hot give me your gasoline.
Yeah...
