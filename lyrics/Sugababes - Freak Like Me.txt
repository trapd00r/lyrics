Let me lay it on the line
I've got a little freakiness inside
And you know that a man has gotta deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
Coz it's all about the dog in me

I wanna freak in the morning
Freak in the evening
(just like me)
I need a rough-neck brother that can satisfy me
(just for me)
If you are that kinda man
Coz baby I'm that kinda girl
I've got a freaky secret
Everybody sing
Coz we don't give a damn about a thing

Chorus:
Coz I will be your freak until the day
Until the dawn
And we can (pump pump)
All through the night
To the early morn'
Come on and I will take you round the hood
On a gangsta lean
Coz we can (pump pump)
Anytime of day
Its all good for me

Boy you're moving kinda slow
You gotta keep up now
There you go
That's just one thing that a man must do,hmm
I'm packing all the flavas you need
I got you shook
Up on your knees
Coz it's all about the dog in me

I'm gonna freak in the morning
A Freak in the evening
(just like me)
I Can rough-neck brother that can satisfy me
(just for me)
If you are that kinda man
Coz I'm that kinda girl
Ive got a freaky secret
Everybody sing
Coz we don't give a damn about a thing

Coz I will be your freak until the day
Until the dawn
And we can (pump pump)
All through the night
To the early morn'
Come on and I will take you round the hood
On a gangsta lead
Coz we can (pump pump)
Anytime of day
Its all good for me

Coz I will be your freak until the day
Until the dawn
And we can (pump pump)
All through the night
To the early morn'
Come on and I will take you round the hood
On a gangsta leabn
Coz we can (pump pump)
Anytime of day
Its all good for me
its all good for me
its all good for me
all good for me-e-e-e-e
