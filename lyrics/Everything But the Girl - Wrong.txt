Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong

I wanted everything for a little while,
why shouldn't I?
I wanted to know what it was like
But I pushed you too far,
and you started laying down the law
till I didn't love you anymore

Now you can pull a little bit
There's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally its gonna break
Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong

Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong

Now there we both were in that little house
Just hanging out
You didn't know what you were about
You turned to me as you were 
threading daisies on a chain
and you said "It's decision time again"

Now you can pull a little bit
There's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally its gonna break
Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong

Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
Cuz I was wrong
