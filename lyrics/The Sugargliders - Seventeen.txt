There’s a whisper through the hails
Calling me here again
Where I’ve been so many times
But never so scared
I know it will be different tonight
Just look at the weather
Thickled heart don’t let me be
Subject to her
Seventeen
Seventeen
Seventeen
And we find ourselves along
With moon lit fields below
And went diving down, forever down
They will not see us again
We’ll be gone by morning
Over streets of fences I can’t say no
Take me with you
Seventeen
Seventeen
Seventeen
Seventeen
Seventeen
Seventeen
