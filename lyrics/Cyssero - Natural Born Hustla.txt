I'm a natural born hustla,
See I ain't gota tell you,
You can see it,
Every ones a customa, and with a simple conversation,
Ill make you believe it that I'm gona get it.


That you can depend,
Pocket full of hundred stacks my friend,
No g no need to pretend,
I'll race you by the stroke of my flow mang.
