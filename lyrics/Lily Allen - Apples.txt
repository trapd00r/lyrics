Do you remember way back when, at my old flat
We'd stay in bed all day having sex and smoking fags
So much has happened since and I wish we could go back
I do things differently, but I went off the tracks

So cliche for me to stay, I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part
I had to do it baby
We were both depressed
Towards the end we were not even having sex
I felt like I was only good for writing the cheques
I like a drink but that does not make me a wreck

So cliche for me to stay, I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part

So cliche for me to stay, I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part

One year in you gave me a set of keys
Two years and you bended down on one knee
Three years and we're living out in the country
Four years and you've given me my beautiful babies
But it was all too much for me
Now I'm exactly where I didn't want to be
I'm just like my mummy and my daddy

I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
