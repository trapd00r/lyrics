Caught by what comes by
Stand alone without a fare chance tonight
Here again by your side when
They turn on all the lights
Yes I'll follow you tonight

Using white lies if we have to
It's easy to forgive and forget it all tomorrow
I just pass by you, pass by me
My last way out and worst mistake tonight
Lying lips wont say my eyes give me away
Wont you please turn out the light
And I'll follow you tonight

I'll follow you tonight
The worst mistake to make
Or just a kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
And I'll follow you to any doorstep, any hallway
With hope of finding more
Not feel shallow not get bored
And find it useless, feeling meaningless
And just as low as I was high the night before

The worst mistake to make
Or just a kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
And I'll follow you tonightâ€¦
