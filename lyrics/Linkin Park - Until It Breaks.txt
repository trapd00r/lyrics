It goes one, two, three

I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don’t need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 8o8 drum
So I don’t run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put ’em both together, now tell me what I got
It's a pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it, ’cause you clearly can’t stop it like that

It ain’t over ’cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn’t matter if you’re wrong or if you’re right
’Cause once you get the teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain’t standing next to you
I’d be laying on the ground before you’re even in my view
Like that

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give you what you need like Papa, who shot ya
Separate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on imposters
And switch styles on the dime, quick witted
Y'all quit tripping, I don’t have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up
Bang bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain’t playing, I’m just saying
You ain’t gotta sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake shake down, money here’s the break down
You can play the bank, I’mma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now, coming to getcha
I’m just a Banksy, you’re a Brainwash, get the picture
It’s like that

We swim against the rising waves and crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks, the early morning sings no more
So rest your head, it’s time to sleep and dream of what’s in store
The body bends until it breaks, then sings again no more
’Cause time has torn the flesh away the early morning sings no more
