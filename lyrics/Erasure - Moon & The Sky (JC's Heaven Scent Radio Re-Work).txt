All of a sudden it's gone 
Too late to wish a friend farewell 
Heard the sea in a shell 
Said we would meet in other worlds 

See how the moon, she cries 
Cool how the tears fill up the sky as snow 

Gotta touch the sky 

Hold you head in my hand 
A taste, a wish, a parting sigh 
Takes the boat across the water 
Heaves a gentle sigh 

See how the moon, she cries 
Cool how the tears fill up the sky as snow 

Gotta touch the sky 

All of a sudden it's gone 
Too late to wish a friend farewell 
Heard the sea in a shell 
Said we would meet in other worlds 

See how the moon, she cries 
Cool how the tears fill up the sky as snow 

Gotta touch the sky 
Gotta touch the sky 
Gotta touch the sky
