Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo
Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee-doo
Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo
Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo
Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee-doo
Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo

I had another coffee
Drank it in the rain
Smoking lots of cigarettes
Please come back again
I'm feeling like a loser
Oh every day and night
I'm walking on the sidewalk
And cannot see the light

Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee-doo
Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo Down on my knees, girl
Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee-doo
Doo-dee-doo Doo-dee-doo I'm begging you, please girl

Oh Baby
Take me to limit - baby come back to me
Everything you want - you get it just for free
Anytime you want -I'll wait can't you see
Baby, baby, baby

Love is a lonesome river
It's like a violin
You're sleeping on my diamond
I'm sleeping in the rain
We're looking to the same stars
But you're not here with me
Every picture tells a story
Only memories
