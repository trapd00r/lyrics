Speeches won't be made today
Clocks will carry on
Flowers won't be left in parks
Work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black
Babies will be born
No flags will fly, the sun will rise
But we will know that you are gone

You who love to love and believed we can never give enough

It wakes me every single night
Thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time
Have doubts at any stage
Were you calm or were you numb
Or happy just to get it done
I've lived my life without regret
Until today

And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough

I didn't get to say goodbye
The day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time
That's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing
You ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret
Until today

And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath
We all felt the same
That was until the day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
The day before the day
