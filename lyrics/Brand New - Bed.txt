My head is lead, I don't ever want to go to bed
Your hair is on fire
You snuff the blaze, turn to vapor then you float away
We got into a bad fight

Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed

My eyes are lungs, I'm a prophet and I speak in tongues
I know how you'll die
Your sister groans, 'oh, usurper to the holy throne'
To me she's just a dead spy

Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends

I don't know what you feel like
Ambushed on the road, stole your gold
You're a rose and you're laughing now
Everything that I owned starts to pile up
Like bones make the walls of a prison
Later on the bed
Later on the bed

I don't ever want to go to bed
Stay up for the fight
The champ goes down like a clown in the second round
I wish we'd had a better goodbye

Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
Later on the bed
