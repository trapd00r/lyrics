All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

The child gave thought to the poet's words
Gave comfort to the Fallen
(Heartfelt, lovelorn)

Remaining, yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
(Lonely soul, Ocean soul)

It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the Man next door
That makes you fear, makes you cry,
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed, unscarred

I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
(Tell me now what to do)

I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence

Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue
Little boy, such precious joy
Is dead to the world

Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

Dead, silent, constant
Yet always changing
- My favorite view of this world

As he died, he will return to die in me again
Weaving the cloth, giving birth to the Century Child
Who gave his life not for the world but for me
Innocence reborn once more

Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue
Little boy, such precious joy
Is dead to the world

Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

We're dead to the world
