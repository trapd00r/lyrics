You feel bad, but not bad enough
You know you had it coming 'cause you played so rough
Back over your shoulder got an icy chill
Man, you thought you'd get away with it
Now you know you never will

Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you

No one knows 'bout the times you had
You've been so evil; you know, you've been so bad
There's a devil to pay for what you put them through
And you got a feeling somebody's following you

Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you
Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you

There's a jack-o-lantern moon in the midnight sky
Somebody gonna live, somebody gonna die
But down in the graveyard on that old tombstone
There's a big black crow and it's callin' you home

Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you
Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you
Somebody
You know there's somebody
