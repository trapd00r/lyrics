Another ringer
With a slick
Trigger finger
For Her Majesty
Another one
With a golden tongue 
Poisoning your fantasy
Another bill
From a killer
Turned a thriller
To a tragedy

Chorus
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die

Another tricky little gun
Giving solace to the one
That'll never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed for your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money
Heaven sent honey
Turning on a dime

Chorus
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die

Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

Another girl
With her finger on the world 
Singing to ya
What you wanna hear
Another gun thrown down
In surrender
Took away your fear
Hey!
Another man
There he stands right behind you
Looking in the mirror

Chorus
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die
