Well, oh well
I'm a high roller
I wear a heavy crown
I have a lot to bring you down

Well, oh when

You roll over and play dead
Hot rocks twinkling round your burning head

Oh shit, I'm taking a hit
Off the ground with my heavy crown

I go around
Oh shit, I'm taking a hit
Off the ground with my heavy crown

In this city there is nothing to cling to
Hello pity, I need someone to sing to
