i wannna know 
the structure of your heart
why did you tear
my broken soul apart
is it a dream 
or my reality
loved and without
after warranty

OoO i want to runaway
you tell me nothing else but lies
i'm singin
OoO i try to runaway
cause i just want to live my life
i'm singin
OoO i want to runaway
as long you are by my side
i'm singin
OoO i try to runaway
but i can't find a place to hide

no i am not
your fucking second choice
no i am not
turnin down my voice

until you understand
there's nothing to command
until you realize
that we can touch the sky

can't you feel
inside us control
can't you feel
there's nothing at all

OoO i want to runaway
you tell me nothing else but lies
i'm singin
OoO i try to runaway
cause i just want to live my life
i'm singin
OoO i want to runaway
as long you are by my side
i'm singin
OoO i try to runaway
but i can't find a place to hide
