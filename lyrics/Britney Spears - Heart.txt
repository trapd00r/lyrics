Heart
I know I've been hard on you
I'm sorry for the things I put you through
Before you start to break on me
Or ask for sympathy
I need to make you see

Oh heart
I'm not sure it's been long enough
To say that what I feel is really love

There is just one way to learn
Sometimes we'll get hurt
And right now it's our turn

Give it time 
Help me through
Heart we can do this together

You're my strength 
You're my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart
All the hurt will soon be gone
If you'll, if you'll just keep on beating strong
You will always be my friend
So keep on hanging in
And we'll find love again

Give it time (give it time)
Help me through (help me)
Heart we can do this together

You're my strength (you're me strength)
You're my soul
I need you now more than ever

Heart
I know I've been hard on you
I'm sorry for the things I've put you through
Please don't you break on me
I need to make you see
It wasn't meant to be
'Cause you, will always be my friend
So keep on hanging in
And we'll find love again
