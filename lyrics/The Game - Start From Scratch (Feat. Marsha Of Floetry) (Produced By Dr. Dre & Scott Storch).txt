Aight
What the fuck are you lookin' at self
You want a piece of me
Ah man shit
The story of my life

If I could start from scratch I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same 45th
Same G-wagon, same hood-rat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit

Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same dog food album bangin' in my tape deck

Homie if I could make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I would have told Pac not to stomp Orlando
Told Puffy and B.I.G. about the Rampart scandal

I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga tez
Seem like we was jus' in magic city yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles he would say

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

Homie if I could rewind the hands of time
I would have cut of the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangsta I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot wit my own 9

I was 2 beeps away from a flat-line
When you a bad boy niggas don't wanna see you shine
Dre said it's my turn, he called it game time
23" Lexanis bitches call 'em Lebron's

I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Luny back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole k, got shot 1 time
That was a cool nigga I wish he had 9 lives

My brother Devon died 'cause he chased a cat
It's a dog eat dog world Jesus please holla back
I got a confession to make its called payback
If y'all don't wanna listen show me where pastor Ma$e at

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

I would have told Big Will it rain every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe you gotta watch where your birds lay
Would have told Vita to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy, that mean the beef is over

Told Meesh to take the Porsche back, drive a Rover
Told slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I would've change a couple of lines when I wrote soldier
So I wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder

My life is like an impala ridin' 3 wheel motion
I've been front to back, side to side
Level my 6 4 frame out, keep on rollin'
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer

Picture The Source suckin' Benzino's dick
Tryna be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when dat green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch you couldn't change that

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

Go right back
