Moving through the slipstream
There go my groceries
Moving through the void
Making my children paranoid

Call me Gyarados, just come and find me, unwind me
Make me comatose in your diary

Don't try to unfuck what you've already fucked cause ya know it's already in perpetual hell
You're alright, you're okay, cause no matter how much you fuck up, you'll get drunk at the end of the day

In the pit of my stomach
I feel at home here, I feel at home here
In the pit of my stomach
I feel at home here, I feel at home here
In the pit of my stomach
I feel at home here, I feel at home here
In the pit of my stomach
