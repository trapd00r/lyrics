It’s gettin late now
Im on the train now
On the way to your place
Cant wait to see your face
Last night was crazy

Got hot and hazy
Now move that mouth around
Hopefully I really do get aroused

Another sweating like a
Whore in church
You got the tools go ahead
And work

I like you thinkin’ im big as a fist
Hey you gotta move on so don’t 
Burst to quick

Can u please this girl a little
Can u tease this girl a  little
Take it back, on your lap, take your
Time, 
Move around

And keep it up all
Night

Can u please this girl a little
Can u tease this girl a  little
Take it back, on your
Lap, throw it down
Move around

And keep me satisfied

This time I’m ready no need to
Await
My body is calling yours to me
Im here for mating
I want to escape
Surrender to me

Your body and soul

No time to lay down, we gotta get
Down
I wanna fool around
( its come from top lost control)
I wanna know how
It feels inside

Your mouth, u got me sayin now
I’m in the zone now

Can u please this girl a little
Can u tease this girl a  little
Take it back, on your
Lap, throw it down
Move around

Keep it up all night

Can u please this girl a little
Can u tease this girl a  little
Take it back, on your
Lap, throw it down
Move around

Keep me satisfied


This time I’m ready no need to
Await
My body is calling yours to me
Im here for mating
I want to escape
Surrender to me

Your body and soul

Body and soul

Body and soul


Another sweating like a
Whore in church
U got the tools go ahead

Hey you gotta move on so

Can u please this girl a little
