Her silhouette
Is bleaker than a cigarette
On a Tuesday morn' when I feel humanity slip
From broken hands down to her hips

Realizing
Lethargy in both her eyes
And as the sun emancipates the dawn
Her tan lines cackle with the power of the allegory


<LINE ORD="2">For a man
He's deeper than the Sundarbans
And the wistful way that he could hold her stare
Leaves heartache hanging in the swollen air

And as they fall apart in separate beds
He carves forever in the cheap wooden bedstead
Realize bitterness in both her eyes
And the way his words could strip the walls she's climbing

Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry about the way she lay
Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry, worry, worry, worry

Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry about the way she lay
Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry, worry, worry, worry

Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry about the way she lay
Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry, worry, worry, worry

He holds her down
Everything is anguish now
With the shallowness of every breath
He waits until she is bereft

Realize
Nothing now in both her eyes
And the way his words have stripped
The walls she's climbing

Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry about the way she lay
Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry, worry, worry, worry

Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry about the way she lay
Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry, worry, worry, worry

Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry about the way she lay
Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry, worry, worry, worry

Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry about the way she lay
Oh, at the end, oh no, oh
I worry, worry, worry, worry
