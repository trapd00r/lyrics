Days before you came
Freezing cold and empty
Towns that change their name
And a horn of plenty

Days before you came
Counting breaths inside me
Even crack-cocaine 
couldn't start to hide me

Won't you join me now?
Baby's looking torn and frayed
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade

Won't you join me now?
Baby's looking to get laid
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade.

Days before you came
It always seemed enticing 
to be naked and profane
There is no denying

Days before you came
Thunderbolt and lightning
Each day a brand new vein
Each tourniquet colliding

I didn't want you anyway X4

Won't you join me now?
Baby's looking torn and frayed
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade

Won't you join me now?
Baby's looking to get laid
Join the masquerade
Join the masquerade

Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you

Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you came
Days before you

I didn't want you anyway X 4
