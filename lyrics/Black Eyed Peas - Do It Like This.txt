Hey bet you can't bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this

Hey

(Fergie's verse)

1 2 3 to the 4
Coming to your hood like a sky missile
Fergie Rock The beat down to the gristle
I spit it clean just like Listerine

(Will.I.Am 's verse)

I'm so official
That's why I'm rocking this rocking this whistle
I'm in the disco
Pretty lady nipples
When I DJ I turn the base off the tickle
The girls with the big big booties
I'm straight chilling cooling out wit cuties
21 and over ain't messing wit juvies
Girls always talking about
I ain't no groupie
I ain't stupid I know what the truth be
You was up chilling with Yeezy last week
You nasty admit you nasty
Trying to act classy
Ask for a glass please
Grab a glass and get wet
Ask for some bubble so I cave moet
I said I don't want trouble
But she said wanna get busy
'Cause she dizzy
So I said let's jet

(Fergie and William's Chorus

We did it and we did it
We did it like this

We did it and we did it
We did it like this

We did it and we did it
We did it like this

We did it and we did it
We did it like

I said bet you can't bet you can't rock it like that

Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like that

Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like that

Bet you can't bet you can't

(Will.i.am)

Do do do do do do

So fresh so clean
This beats crazy this beats obscene
This shits laced with shit so mean

Letting off steam

Ring ring ring like a machine
This shits money Ni*** this shits green

That means I'm the what what king

(Fergie and William's verse)
Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this

Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this

Bet you can't bet you can't rock it like this

Bet you can't bet you can't
Yo yo yo yo

Of um demolition
Check the new composition
Bless ya down with killer ammunition
I got a proposition

'Cause this beat bangs
A banger
Like a macho submission
I got a intuition
Tonight's gonna a good good exhibition
Hope you don't have no heart condition

Think you could rock it like this
You wishin
