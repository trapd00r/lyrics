You ask why I'm wastin' myself on the wine
And if I'll come with you you show me a good time
Well haven't you noticed these rings on my hand
This bottle is taking the place of my man
They called him to dudy but I have one too
Bein' true to the man who is fighting for you
I got lonesome without him so I found me a friend
This bottle is taking the place of my man
[ steel ]
I'm not proud of this bottle just got proud in one thing
Ever since he's been gone I've been true to his name
I'll be just like he left me when he come home again
This bottle is taking the place of my man
You can buy me a drink but I think you should know
That a drink and some talk is as far as I go
I'll be nobody's woman till he holds me again
This bottle is taking the place of my man
