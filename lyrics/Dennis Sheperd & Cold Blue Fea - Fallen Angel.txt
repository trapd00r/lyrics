Into the darkness
Into the fear
Swept away by the past
And ghosts that re-appear

Who will you run to
When you're feeling down
And who will you turn to
When it's all gone

Fallen angel
Lost your wings
Can't find your way back home
Haunted by the painful sting

Dreams of heaven
Have turned to flames of hell
Just when you least expected
Under her spell

Who will you run to
When you're feeling down
And who will you turn to
When it's all gone

Fallen angel
Lost your wings
Can't find your way back home
Haunted by the painful sting
