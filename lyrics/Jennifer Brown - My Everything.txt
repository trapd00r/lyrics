They say that life is always changing 
And love comes and goes 
Wherever time may finally take us 
Oh, heaven only knows 

People can go apart 
Lately you seem so far 
Maybe the sun sets every day 
But don't slip away 

You are my everything 
You are my dreams come true 
Oh, baby, how I love you 
You are my everything 
Wherever life may take us through 
I don't want to lose you 

I wake up early in the morning 
And I watch you sleep 
I pray for all the lies between us (Yes, I do) 
May time safely keep 

Without the day that comes 
With every setting sun 
Don't let the dark take a stop 
Don't let our dreams touch the ground 

You are my everything 
You are my dreams come true 
Oh, baby, how I love you 
You are my everything 
Wherever life may take us through 
I don't want to lose you 

The road of life may twist and turn 
There's so many bridges to cross 
Don't let our love be lost 

You are my everything (Yes, you are) 
Oh, you're my dream come true 
You are my everything 
Wherever life may take us through 
I don't want to lose you 

Oooh, you are my everything 
Oh, yes you are 
You're my everything 
I don't want to lose you
