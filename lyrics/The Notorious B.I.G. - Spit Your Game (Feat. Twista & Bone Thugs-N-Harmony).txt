Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang wit us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us, Notorious
Thug ass niggas that love to bust
It's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryin' to win, tryin' not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen
Steadily countin' them benjamins
Nigga you should to
If you knew wut this game would do 2 u
Bin in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I've bin through
So called beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then a bluelight niggas knew like Mike-shiiit
Not to be fuck wit
Muthafucka betta duck quick
'Cuzz me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit strictly aim
No asperation to quit da game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit

Nigga money livin' marvelous, in God we trust
Don't too many niggas wanna start wit us
Got big guns in the cars wit us
Bust at any muther fucka actin' hard wit us
Don't really wanna show you wut a G.I.B.
I'd rather be sippin' Remy in V.I.P.
When you hear the music it'll be by me
Twista and the legendary nigga B.I.G.
Brooklyn and K-town, when you check out the flow
U know it's goin' rain with persistence
2 legends on the same track
2 differend plains of existence
Let's get it crackin' I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back 'cause I love to buck hoe
Spit it for the city I love Chi-ca-go
Cali-coes buck, I love to bust those
You think you can spit on the mike like Biggie and flow just as steady as I
Shit is real you know you love him
U ain't got "Ready to Die"
"Life After Death", give to you
However you wanna nigga
That a day after, give it to you
However you wanna nigga
'Cause the shit a get deep
So I carry big heat
Screamin' girls get me
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz beat
3 mils I love to make 1
All these cars I love to ride 1
All these hoes I love to cut 1
A tribute to BIG I love to bust 1

In the middle of an Hour
Bring niggas more drama than they baby mama
Nigga wanna battle ima bomb ya
One man but I attack like a pack of pirahnas
Like taracotta, niggas always ready for war
But they don't really wanna see a nigga tho
We can hit 'em in a minute, then we finish wit him
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga wit a Sick-ol' Slow
Doin' it wit Swizz, oh no!
Niggas in trouble, somebody better call po-po
It's gonna be murder when I get to servin' them verbally (Yeah!)
And niggas y'all heard of me, brick city killa, nigga word to me
And I'm Classic like Bird 'n' Magic
With a tactic to stack snatch his rep back and stack some Platinum
Double on 'em at random
With the bullets I brand him
Fin' to hold the game Ransom
Runnin' up in ya mansion, cash demandin', flashing cannons
Niggas ain't ready for this 1, 'cause I'm on a mission to get even
Better believe it, I'm heavily heated
It's easy to see it, if you wanna see me let that be the reason
