Tall machines wait in line
So still lost in time
Jets turn and make no sound
Returning to the solid ground
People drift out of time
Watching numbers turn
Seems that I've been waiting here forever

Jetstream
Stormy seas
Cast adrift on a troubled dream
I've seen the sleeping ships at night
I will meet you there
The roar of the engine in the air (Jetstream)

Leave the things you don't need
And the ones that you don't love
Faith and hope
Keeps our minds together 
Your heart's left the ground tonight
Scattered lost in light
Seems that I've been waiting here forever

Jetstream
Carbon seas
Cast adrift on a troubled dream
I've seen the silent jets at night
I will meet you there
The roar of the engine high in the air (Jetstream)

Sleeping ships in the night 
Shining steel lost in time
Jets turn, make no sound
Returning to the safer ground
People running outta time
Lost in love, last in line
Seems I've waited here forever

Jetstream
Stormy seas
Cast adrift on a troubled dream
I see the silent jets at night
I will take you there
The roar of the engine pollutes the air

Jetstream
