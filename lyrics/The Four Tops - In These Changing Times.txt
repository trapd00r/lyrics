(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
(Never gonna stray away)

In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, no
In these changing times

How much of a sinner do you see (Stay away)
Mind you, how you miss the scenery
That's why the day
The love don't last
(Stay away)
Makes life movin'
Much too fast
(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
Never, never, never ever leave
(Never gonna stray away)
Oh, no

Oh, in these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, no
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

Now listen
Some men are never satisfied
Even with the right woman
By his side
(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
Changes women
Like the coins in his hand
(Never gonna stray away)
But I know
That ain't really the measure of a man
I'm too much a part of you
To be a part of someone else
(Stay away)
If I cheat on you, girl
I'd be cheating on myself

So, in these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
No, I'll never, never stray

In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

In these changing times
