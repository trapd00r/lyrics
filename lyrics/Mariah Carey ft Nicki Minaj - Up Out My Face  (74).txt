It's not chipped
We not cracked
Oh, we're shatterred

Eh eh eh
Eh eh eh
Na na na na

Verse 1:
I thought we had something special
Like we had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by ya boy
Don’t you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa
And I’m on the TV
You might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won’t see me for free
Boy this ain’t no promo

Bridge:
You're all ashamed now
Wherever you been laying you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don’t keep calling from your mama house

Chorus:
When I break I break
Boy up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break, uh
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break

You ain’t never gonna feel this thing again
You gon’ get a lot of calls ‘cause I cc'd all your friends
I break
I ain’t walking around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag baby
I break
I break, I break



Verse 2:
So look who’s crying now
Boo hoo hoo
Talking about your missing your
Boo hoo hoo
I know you ain't getting it
I know you ain’t hittin’ it
Know you ain’t a rapper so you need to stop spitting it

Ha ha ha ha ha
You wondering who I’m messing with while you ain’t next to me
I’m goin' bye hah ha ha ha
So pay the consequences cause you acted all ignorant…

Bridge:
You ashamed now
Wherever you been laying you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don’t keep calling from your mama house

Chorus:
When I break I break
Boy up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
When I break I break

You ain’t never gonna feel this thing again
You gon’ get a lot of calls cause I cc'd all your friends
I break
I ain’t walking around all mopey and sad
They collecting my bags baby

Breakdown:
Cause when I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this sh---
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this sh---
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this 
When I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn’t put us back together again

Chorus:
When I break
Boy up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break, uh
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break

You ain’t never gonna feel this thing again
You gon’ get a lot of calls ‘cause I cc'd all your friends
I break
I ain’t walking around all mopey and sad
They collecting my bags baby
I break

When I break I break
Boy up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break, uh
Up out my face boy
Up out my face boy
Up out my face
I break

I'll tell you what
I'll tell you nothing
I'll tell you something
I'm outta here oh yeah
