Alone among the living
Man is haunted by the knowledge of future
Because we have the sense of time
The means to count the hours
Days and years with precision

Yet despite this sensitivity and these techniques
Despite our plans and our predictions
The future eludes us
Impenetrable and secret

This deep rooted desire to anticipate
And control the future
Is probably as old as society itself

For the ancients the universe is a whole
Cosmological single living organism

A system of mathematical geometry
Attributing this correspondence
To the interactions and physical connections
Between the different celestial spheres
And the Earth
