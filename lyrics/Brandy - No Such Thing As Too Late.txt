I know you're thinking I'd be tripping,
Thinking I'd be playing, you'll be saying
I'm into you.
Just take a second, and listen
'Cause I ain't into laying with just anybody
Baby I ain't trying to kill my body so soon
Let me know you're worth it
Do you deserve a chance to touch, to feel my love
Cause ain't nobody perfect, underneath the surface
Can you show me your love

And when it's time, I won't have to tell you so
You'll see the stars are shining the same
So take your time, this love ain't got nowhere to go
It'll all be way better if we wait

There's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody, you can wait


There's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody, you can wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late

...
Judging from my intuition
Yeah yeah yeah
...
I could probably get my soul too
My soul too
'Cause I want you to love me
Whenever you get that chance too
To touch, to feel my love
'Cause ain't nobody perfect
Underneath the surface can you
Show me your love

And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
'Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It'll all be way better if we wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late

When you really love somebody, you can wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late

Listen to my heart
And drown this into yours
And if they say the same thing then
I know you're ready
But until then we should be patient
Let's not start
But when you start
I promise you're gonna love it baby

And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You'll see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
'Cause love ain't got nowhere to go
It'll all be way better if we wait
'Cause there's no such thing as too late

When you really love somebody, you can wait
(Don't yo think?)
'Cause there's no such thing as too...
