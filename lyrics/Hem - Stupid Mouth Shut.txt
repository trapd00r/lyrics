The sidewalk bends where your house ends
Like the neighborhood is on its knees
You're surrounded by a chain-link fence
That keeps me out but lets me see

Well I come by most every night
The shutters pounding in the breeze
A clothesline strung like paper kites
That blow my words right back at me

But someday when my heart exhales
I'll tell you everything
These sweet words spilling all about us
I'll say please please be with me
And I'll breathe so easily
But instead I'm turning blue
I look at you
And keep my stupid mouth shut

The hall light streams out through the screens
And the shadows capture me in webs
Just tangled up in what I've seen
And every word I have not said
I have not said

'Cause the sidewalk bends where your house ends
Like the neighborhood is on its knees
