Just think about it
Just think about it

Lately I've been skeptical
Silent when I would used to speak
Distant from all around me
Who witnessed me fail and become weak

Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one
To disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when
I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all
And I guess things will never change

But you might need my hand when
Falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember
When I'm letting go of

You and me, we're through
And re-arranged

It seems that you're not satisfied
Too much on your mind
So you leave and I can't believe
All the bullshit that I find

Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one
To disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when
I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all
And I guess things will never change

But you might need my hand
When falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember
When I'm letting go of

You and me we're through
And rearranged
You and me we're through
And rearranged

You're no good for me
Thank God it's over

You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin'
And you make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin'

You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin'
Cryin' on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin' (dyin')
Dyin' on me

You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you
You ruin everything
You kept fuckin' with me
Until it's over
And I won't be the same

You think that everybody's the same
You ruin everything
You kept fuckin' with me
Until it's over
And I won't be the same
I don't think that anybody's like you

Just think about it
You'll get it
