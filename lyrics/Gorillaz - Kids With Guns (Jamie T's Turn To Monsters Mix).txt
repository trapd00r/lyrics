Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Taking over
They won't belong
They're mesmerized
Skeletons
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say "no" to
Drinking out (Push it, push it real)
Pacifier (Push it, push it real)
Demon souls (Push it, push it real)
Street desire (Push it, push it real)
Doesn't make sense to (Push it, push it real)
But it won't be long (Push it, push it real)
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say "no" to


And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Drinking out
Pacifier
sinking souls
There you are
Doesn't make side to
But it won't be long
Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they've got something to say "no" to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Push it real, push it, is this real? (push it, push it real)
