It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Ooh ah

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Ooh ah

You're trying too hard
Surrender
Give yourself in
You're trying too hard
You're trying too hard
Oh

It's not meant to be a strife
it's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Sweetly...
It's not meant to be a strife
...to enjoy
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

It's warmer now
Lean into it
Unfold in a generous way
Surrender
Surrender

It's not meant to be a strife
Undo
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

I'm praying
To be
In a generous mode
The kindness kind
The kindness kind
To share me

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Quietly ecstatic
Undo

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Undo
Undo
If you're bleeding
Undo
If you're sweating
Undo
If you're crying
Undo

Ooh ah
