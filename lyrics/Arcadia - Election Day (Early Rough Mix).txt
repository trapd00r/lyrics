Wild kind of look to the day
Opening eyes impale neon flickers
She moon, she turning away
The city's her slave
He's cheating his mistress
She's moody and grey, 
She's mean and she's restless
(So restless, so restless indeed)

All over you as they say
Rumours or rivals yell at the strike force 
Hi guys, by the way, are you aware you're being illegal 
It's making your savior behavior look evil
'scuse my timing but say,
How d'you fit in with this flim, flam and Judy

Maximum big surprise your smile is something new
I pull my shirt off and pray,
We're sacred and bound to suffer the heat wave
Pull my shirt off and pray,
We're coming up on re-election day

Stretching my love down the way
To your invitation stretching my body
Use your intuitive play
Cause maybe we have more play time than money

Maximum big surprise she knows something new
I pull my shirt off and pray,
I'm saving myself to suffer the heat wave
Pull my shirt off and pray,
We're coming up on re-election day

(By roads and back ways a lover's chance, down a wind
Curtain murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
Carry further.. entangled strands.. all sing!
Time, saving some time to slip away we could die )

Oh! shouldn't be asking... (why)
Wild and scheming
Could be my election day

Maximum big surprise you know something new
I pull my shirt off and pray,
We're sacred and bound to suffer this heat wave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day

Re-election day
