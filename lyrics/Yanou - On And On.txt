Tic-tac says the clock on the wall
It tells me everything is wrong, maybe
I lost my dreams along the way
Feels like we're about to fall
Into the shadow I run but lately gravity
Is pulling me back on my feet again

Why don't we say goodbye
Cos' now I know how it feels to live a lie
It's hurting so deep inside
Tell me why, oh its breaking me, its killing me
So why..draw the line

Tic-tac every heart beat drums
Whenever you're around baby
Can't seem to chase those clouds away
There's no escape from it all
Into the shadow I run but lately gravity
Is pulling me back on my feet again

Why don't we say goodbye
Cos' now I know how it feels to live a lie
Oh it's hurting so deep inside
Tell me why, oh it's breaking me, it's killing me
What if we turned around and walk away
Right now.
Would you cry, would you die a little
Oh boy I'm about to say goodbye

Oh why don't we say goodbye
Cos' now I know how it feels to live a lie
Oh it's hurting so deep inside
Tell me why, oh it's breaking me, it's killing me

Oh it turning so deep inside
Tell me why, oh it's breaking me, it's killing me
So why...draw the line,
I draw the line
