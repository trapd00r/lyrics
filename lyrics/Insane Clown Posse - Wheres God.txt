Innocent..........folks
Folks..
Innocent folks wrong place at the wrong time,
Doing bids or drawn in a chalk line, little kids crossing the bridge too young,
Some tortured before they come, {damn}
Evil is here, the boogie man too, 
You  don't own a gun, man you should plan to, 
Am I looking at shxt negatively, 
Crib death mom ain't got shxt left,
How the fxck is shxt fair out here,
Homeless family froze on the stairs, where's God bumping his ipod, 
It's odd, I'll be the lightning rod, 
I wanna know, 
Where's God? {pitiful that} 
Where's God? 
Where's God, when shxt goes down?i wanna know,
Where's God? {pitiful that} 
Where's God? 
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right} 
Are we all be tested fail me then, 
So much fxcked up shxt where to begin,
Some kids are born with a silver spoon,  
Others born with a needle & a world of doom, 
Little girl found duct taped & raped, & the killer escaped God give me a break,   
I want to keep believing but it's a struggle,
Let Jake & jack jeckel juggle,
Drunk drivers killing Iraq survivors,  he can't interfere, then why's he here?, 
After years of feeling like nobody cares,
Most of us switch gears on Him, Cheers, 
Cheers......
Where's God? {pitiful that} 
Where's God? 
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right} cheers....
Where's God? {pitiful that} 
Where's God? 
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
Children fire, everybody dies,
As a preacher explains & I roll my eyes, 
This game tryin' to make sense of madness,
For a ray of hope in a world of sadness,
I get it,  we all need hope to cope,
But collection plate money goes to dope,
I cling by a finger & I'll admit it,
Most of it is bullshxt, & I don't get it, 
If he was up there chillin', 
Lettin' this happen,
Doin' nuttin',
He'd be in need of a slappin', 
But we're all clueless to how it works,
There are no experts & that's what hurts,  
Where's God? {pitiful that} 
Where's God? {we need Him here} where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
Where's God? {pitiful that} 
Where's God? {we need Him here}
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}

"There's not an individual who's ever confessed Christ, who has not but one time or another, said the wrong thing, thought the wrong thing, done the wrong thing, & I don't care how saved you are"

Where's God? {pitiful that} 
Where's God? {we need Him here}
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
Where's God? {pitiful that}
Where's God? {we need Him here}
Where's God, when shxt goes down? {it ain't right}
{pitiful that}

I still believe.....

It ain't right, 
Pitiful that, 
We need him here, 
It ain't right
