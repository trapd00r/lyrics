You know the summer time is gone now
All the leaves are on the ground
Everything is turning
Stuck in a rut

You know another year is over
Ad another candle is on the cake
I ain't getting any younger no, no, no
Stuck in a rut
And only you could get me out of this place

[Chorus]
Save me
Give me what I need
I know you can break these chains
And set me free
Save me
Give me what I need
I know you can break these chains
And set me free
Set me free

You know the wintertime is here now
And my poor heart is freezing up
Keep, keep the fire burning, baby
Stuck in a rut
And only you can melt the pain away

[Chorus]

Wishing you were here
'Cause I can't hold on calm me down when I lie awake
All night long

[Chorus]

You know the summer time is gone now
And my poor heart is freezing up
