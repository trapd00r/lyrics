Television and gershwin accompany the stew
Wooden thrones for forgotten kings fill with pulpy termite queens
Termite mother with amoebic torpor
Gelatinous and quivering, scans and sleeps
I am a mighty tree in this obsidian forest
A god of sorts
Listening to bleedy sounds of cats being sawed in half
Cool, indifferent
Eternal but blind, greedy for entropy
Drinking cargoes of banshees
Dancing crimson mazurkas
Through the mazes of shelved dreams
