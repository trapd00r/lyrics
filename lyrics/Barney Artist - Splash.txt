(Verse 1)
Secrets always sound good in the dark
Eyes closed seeing your heart
Lights off when we feeling in the
Lights off when we feel in the dark
Touch, wait
Cream in the bath
Suds fall when I’m feeling your arm
Got caught now I’m hearing alarms
Got caught now I’m hearing alarms

Sinking in the love not able to move
Maintain what is true
Gateway drug is my loving of you
Stay safe nah I’m trouble it’s true
Play games uh
Wait
Mandem are saying you do
Ain’t gonna front staying with you
Ain’t gonna front laying with you
Good and well
Feel you girl
Now I’m swimming round with your tales
Feed me loving and don’t give me hell
Secret loving don’t make me tell
Good and well
Feel you girl
Now I’m swimming round with your tales
Feed me loving and don’t give me hell
Secret loving don’t (Stop!)

(Chorus)
Secrets always sound good in the dark
Eyes closed seeing your heart
Lights off when we feeling in the
Lights off when we feel in the dark
Touch wait
Cream in the bath
Suds fall when I’m feeling your arm
Got caught now I’m hearing alarms
Got caught now I’m hearing alarms

(Verse 2)
Lips on my neck scratching my back girl
Seeing you sweat I gonna back down
Leaving a mess do you know understand now
Dreams in effects are we gonna land now
Hearing your breath (Sigh)
Gliding around in the room
Finding the mountain is you
Climbing around in the (wait)
Climbing around for the views
Finding my sight from the roof
I been Hiding my lies in the truth
Timing is finding the loot
Diving around in a loop
Can you understand what I do
Sobering doom
Hope you don’t hear this verse from my room
I ain’t gonna lie I was nervous of you
But I’m standing in line for you Truth (word)

(Chorus)
Secrets always sound good in the dark
Eyes closed seeing your heart
Lights off when we feeling in the
Lights off when we feel in the dark
Touch wait
Cream in the bath
Suds fall when I’m feeling your arm
Got caught now I’m hearing alarms
Got caught now I’m hearing alarms
