Look up 
Look where you wanna be 
Look left 
Look where he left me 

I should've known 
By the ice in his eye 
But you warm me up with your so sweet demise 
And nestled in your calculated moon shine

Boy you give good 
Love, plastic love 
You're a genuine wannabe 
And you got it all up your blue sleeve, your sleeve 
Love, plastic love 
You're a genuine wannabe 
And you got it all up your blue sleeve, but me 

Oh, Papa, oh, Papa, tonight 
Papa, oh, I'll be alright 

Look left 
Look where you wanna be 
Look up 
Look where he left me 

I should've known by the ice in his eye 
But you warm me up with your so sweet demise 
And nestled in your calculated emotion

Boy you give good 
Love, plastic love 
You're a genuine wannabe 
And you got it all up your blue sleeve, your sleeve 
Love, plastic love 
You're a genuine wannabe 
And you got it all up your blue sleeve, but me 

Oh, Papa, oh, Papa, tonight 
Papa, oh, I'll be alright
