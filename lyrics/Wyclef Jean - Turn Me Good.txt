The way you touch me
Your love is holy
Turn me good [x2]

What we gonna do when we get to Zion
Imma love you all night
We gonna be alright [x2]

When I couldn't pay the rent
I had no money to spend
I was caught up in the trench
Now you're the reason that we rich
When the feds raid the door
Put the shadow on the floor
They found them things in the drawer
You got me the lawyer for the court

What we gonna do when we get to Zion
We gonna make love all night
Like a Marvin Gaye song

What we gonna do when we get to Zion
We gonna make love all night
Like Mr. Marley

Turn down the lights
We don't need no interruption
Turn down the lights
We can have a deep discussion
Turn up the lights, Baby
You don't have to hide your imperfections
Turn down the lights

Ehh, What we gonna do when we get to Zion
We gonna make love all night
Like a Marvin Gaye song

What we gonna do when we get to Zion
We gonna make love all night
We gonna be alright

Wait a minute baby
You're so real
You shoot to kill
Ehh, in this cold world
We feel them chill
Zion awaits, yeah
I'm in the bed
At them golden gates

What we gonna do when we get to Zion
We gonna make love all night
And I'm feeling alright

What we gonna do when we get to Zion
We gonna be alright
We gonna love all night

The way you touch me
Your love is holy
Turn me good [x2]
