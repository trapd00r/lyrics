If today was not an crooked highway
If tonight was not an crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
Yes and if only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

I can't see my reflection in the water
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Or remember the sounds of my own name

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And If I could hear her heart softly pounding
Yes and only if only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

There's beauty in that silver singing river
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky
But none of these, and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
Yes and only If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
