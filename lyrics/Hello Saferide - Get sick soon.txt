Oh, I love you
I wish you got the flu
So I could take care of you
Like you take care of me

I'm such a Florence
A real Florence Nightingale
I'll fluff your pillows
I'll buy you a Spiderman comic and read you
'Til you fall asleep

Sleep on my shoulder
I won't wake you even if
My back turns crooked
And I have to walk with
A limp for a week

I'll make you soup
And none of that kind
That you get in a jar cause I know
You don't like those

Oh, I love you
I wish you got the flu
You're the cutest thing I've ever seen
Like a teddy bear on heroin
Come, I'll tuck you in tight
And I'll sing for you all night
All night
All night
All night

You can hold the remote
I won't try to steal it
And the best cushion is yours
And you can have your feet on me
Even though I'm scared of feet
And even though I had a hard day at work

Oh, I love you
I wish you got the flu
You can lay your weight on me
And I'll be your backbone
You won't have to worry
'Cus I'll be your backbone
Just lay your weight on me
Lay your weight on me
You won't have to worry
'Cus I'll be your backbone
Just lay your weight on me
Lay your weight on me
You won't have to worry
'Cus I'll be your backbone
Just lay your weight on me
Lay your weight on me
