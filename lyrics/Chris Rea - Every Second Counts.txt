Every second counts
That's what he says
Every second counts
Every single day
All through the night time
And all through the day time
Can't let your world pass through and in to my way
Every second counts
He can't slow down
Every second counts
See his spin around
He's chasing his shadow
He's racing the wind
He tells us to follow
Where the ice is so thin

I hope you're holding on
I hope you're holding on
'Cos every second counts
