All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time 
Breaking my life in two

(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh)
Now that I really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh )
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh)
Only for you I don't regret

And I was Thursday's child
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was)

Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh)
Now that I really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh )
Oh ho, everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Throw me tomorrow, oh oh)
Only for you I don't regret
And I was Thursday's child

(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was)
Thursday's child
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was)
Thursday's child
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was)
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was)
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was)
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, born I was)
