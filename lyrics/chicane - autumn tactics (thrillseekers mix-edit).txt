Deep river runs its course
To a warm horizon
Shadows of falling leaves
October moon and rusty skies
Ever changing feelings
The seeds of autumn in my mind

The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun

Hiding summers age no more
No more leaves in summer sky
Turning dark on empty car lots
When summer was my only friend

So you're back this way again
Winters one breath away
So you're back this way again
Winters one breath away
It's turning cold

Like the hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun
The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
