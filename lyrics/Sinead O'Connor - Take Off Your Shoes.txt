I plead the blood of Jesus over you
I plead the blood of Jesus over you
And over every fucking thing you do
Seven times I plead the blood of Jesus over you

Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground
Even you can't lie when I'm around
Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground

Behold, I'm the last lamplight
At the very end of your street
I'm whispering something
Come closer to me
Come closer to me

I say you're running out of battery
You're running out of battery
And I don't see no bunnies around here

If you believed at all in your breviary 
If you believed just even in the ghost of me
You wouldn't now be so surprised to see me

In vanity you took the name of me
You brought me into infamy
And now you're so surprised to see me
And now you're so surprised to see me

Behold, I'm the last lamplight 
At the very end of your street
I'm whispering something
Come closer to me
Come closer to me

I say you're running out of battery
You're running out of battery
And I don't see no bunnies around here

Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground
Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground
Even you can't lie when I'm around
Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground

Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground
Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground
Even you can't lie when I'm around
Take off your shoes
You're on hallowed ground

I plead the blood of Jesus over you
I plead the blood of Jesus over you
