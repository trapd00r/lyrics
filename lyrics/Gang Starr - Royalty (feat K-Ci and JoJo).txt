"Gangstarr has gots to be the sure shot" --> Greg Nice
"And it's like dat" (Primo scratching)

"GangStarr" "Represent"

(K-Ci and JoJo) Oh yeah

(Guru)
One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of feindish when I'm at this
Been doin' this for eons, peons best to catch this
Vision of excellence, precise rappin' ability
Bout to make some dead presidents, macking a million G
The money though, it's got people actin' funny yo
As soon as some niggaz get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin' played out
When authentic niggaz step up, respect be laid out
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, waving my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, creme de la creme
Spent years buildin with cats in the streets, so they my men
Again, GangStarr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listening to beats to keep the cypher complete
Wether you kids be holdin', on the block all day
Or you be puffing lye, out in the back hallway
Or whether you being schooled, or in the library
Wherever you are Baby Pah, realize that your essence
Is divine son, and let it shine son
As we refine son, aiyyo, this shit'll blow your mind son
We're royalty

Chorus: K-Ci and JoJo

Wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

(Guru)
And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey annoits me with oils G
After work she greets me, and treats me like royalty
Works with me, giving herself, by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame, or my ride
A lot of ladies out there, be lookin' lovely
But they don't got no control of the their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin' to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
While we're takin' part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty

Chorus: K-Ci and JoJo

Whatever I do, Wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

"GangStarr has to gots to be the sure shot" --> Greg Nice
"And it's like dat" (Primo scratching)
