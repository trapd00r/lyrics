people are so fickle
these days its so dispicable
like tenticles, they all try stick on you
hold you down if they cannot be sick on you
they try to bind you with an A too (?)
enforce the written restrictions that we all got to stick to
they all disapear and re appeared 
to suit their needs
which to me is a joke, 
like short term peace treaties

i see a disease
swarming like bees 
thinking these underdeveloped war torn countries
apparently im on the good side
but this worlds so freaky at times
i swear this planets on an intergalactic fault line
every time i race i cant win
i keep place till this land mines blow up in my face again
dismembered, i still gotta keep pacin' on, standin strong 
facing the eye of the storm

these days three ways
the life game all wrong
these days, what we say
can do such harm
i replay. each day
like an endless song
endless of my mind, non stop
like the hands of time

whats with this financial envy
we've got so much poverty, but we keep spending
we're like pigs, they just won't stop eating till they hit the bottom of the trough and lick up stinkin
im seekin the truth , but how can i be
we're in a broken world of families and falacies
taught to praise stars who seek fame, 
do what we must to gain monatry gain
and even im with it, but there are limits
whatever happened to unconcious idea, 
MC's talk verbal dihorrea
caught up with gun talk and bling bling,
hip hop producers who work with pop singers, for ching ching, 
im thinking

my rich stole, is now of no value
light turns to dark, when cold breath hits the candle
im here to rekindle your spirit
keep the flame burning strong
as we press on 
through the eye of the storm

these days three ways
the life game all wrong
these days, what we say
can do such harm
i replay. each day
like an endless song
endless of my mind, non stop
like the hands of time

the clock ticks
your name off the list
life goes quick, so we gotta be quicker
the worlds devilish, making me sicker
i smell the reminants, of drugs, sex and liquor
the kids are immune to these
cus as they leave 
they get a fix on their new tv
parents dont need a talk to their kids no more
they feed em video 
show them the internet
log onto the porn site
here we go
television
the drug of a nation
breeding ignorance
feeding radiation
friend to hit the nail on the head
wish we were sailing ahead
but we're shipwrecked and failing instead
but the tests of changed were all passed
so long as you're an expert in arson
im asking which way is up, cus my compass is gone
you know what?
I'm gonna let my beating heart be my guide through the eye of the storm

these days three ways
the life game all wrong
these days, what we say
can do such harm
i replay. each day
like an endless song
endless of my mind, non stop
like the hands of time
