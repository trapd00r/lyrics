I can tell
By your look
There’s something missing
Something I took

I can tell
By the way you sound
Won’t be long
You won’t be around

Oehh I’m losing you
Oehh I’m losing you

Was it my words
Or my silence
I know it hurts
My kind of violence

Won’t you tell
How I hurt you
Won’t be long
You won’t be around

Oehh I’m losing you
Oehh I’m losing you
