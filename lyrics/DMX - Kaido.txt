Uh......This should go out to my dawg Kato....rest in piece baby....he's the kingpin

[Chorus DMX]

Dawgs that i called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things i do for my friends
We miss you, Kato! Kato!

[Verse 1]

Started of two dawgs wit the the goals
Nuttin but two dawgs walkin the same road
Two different cultures, but had the same heart
Enjoyed seein the light, but lived in the dark
5th album bumped heads in the park alot
Was a pride brother, didnt like to bark alot
Came correct, when he came, he gained respect
So i gave respect, we shared the same respect
Two names in wreck now on the circles
Two brothers with good heart, but if you start, two brothers that will hurt you
You know how that dirt, hittin four corners
Earh! Earh! Earh! Earh!, right back upon us
God tried to warn us but sometimes we dont see
When i first heard im like "this cant be, yall niggaz is buggin
Got the wrong information or suttin, please tell me that these niggaz is frontin
God No"

[Chorus DMX (Magic)]

Dawgs that i called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things i do for my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)
Dawgs that i called my friends
(We Miss) Praying (You) for (Kato) all my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)

[Verse 2]

If its ok, let me kick it wit you for a minute
There left unsaid dawg we wasnt finished
Never got to say thank you for bein a friend
Dawgs! for Life! and you, will role to the end
Held dawg down didnt let a day go by
Everytime dawg came to the shy (what!)
I was good, trips out to Phoenix with the scrambling squad
If i come back to Phoenix im like, damn its hard
To accept the fact (Uh), that you wont be comin back (Uh)
But i hope your comin back (Uh), cause i wont accept the fact (Uuhh!)
When you came to New York, You had to come to the crib
And vise-versa (Yeah!), thats just how we did
Remote-contol cars (What!), we would race all day
It was adventure, we would chase all day (Yeah!)
So im not gon say good-bye ma nigga (uh uh)
Instead i would rather (Rather) focus on the time we spent together
Thats what matters (for real)

[Chorus DMX (Magic)]

Dawgs that i called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things i do for my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)
Dawgs that i called my friends
(We Miss) Praying (You) for (Kato) all my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)

[Verse1]

I need you to save me a spot next to you and the Lord (Aight)
I dont know when im comin but keep checkin the door (Aight)
But while im here, knock on wood
I'll make sure your kids remember who they farther was and Val is good (aight!)
Understood how real niggaz move, we dont talk (We dont talk)
But you gon' always have family in New York, believe that (Yeah)
Where you at you can see that
We dawgs for life and in death and i mean that, Vato
