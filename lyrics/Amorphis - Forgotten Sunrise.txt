Once I had a mind
And thoughts was given

But nowadays, in this evil age
All my sense is somewhere else

Once I had a soul
I was one with my god

But now I am abandoned
Banished from these lies

Long my tale's been in the cold
For ages has lain hidden

I know how to bewitch fire
And how to fame flames
I know how to banish worms
And turn snakes away
