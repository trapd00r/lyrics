Don't! 
Don't... don't you wish we tried?
Do you feel what I feel inside?
You know our love is stronger than pride... oh
No don't... don't let your anger grow
Just tell me what you need me to know
Please talk to me, don't close the door


Hmmm, 'cause I wanna hear you
I wanna be near you


[Chorus]
Don't fight, don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away
Don't tell me to go


Don't!... Don't give up on trust
Don't give up on me, on us
If we could just hold on long enough 

Hmmm, we can do it
we'll get through it


[Chorus]
Don't fight, don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go 

Don't pretend that it's okay
Things won't get better that way
Don't do something you might regret someday... 
Don't! 

[dobro solo, instrumental]
Don't give up on me
Hmm, Don't!
(We can do it) We'll get through it 

[Chorus]
Don't fight, don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go 

Don't! (Don't fight dont argue)
Don't give up on me
(Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry)
Say that that I'm sorry
(Just let me love you)
Don't give up on me
(Don't turn me away)
Don't tell me to go 

Don't!
(Don't fight don't argue)
Don't give up on me
(Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry)
Say that that I'm sorry
(Just let me love you)
Dont give up on me
(Don't turn me away)
Don't tell me to go...
