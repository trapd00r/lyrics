Taste the tears on my chin and swallow. 
They came there with a grin of sorrow 
And a tangled mind that considers this and that, 
That digs to find but hasn't managed quite yet.

But I'm fine, like a charm, 
Resting here on your arm and you're taking my thoughts away.

Kiss the demons goodbye and take me 
In your arms, hold me tight. 
Shake me to this gentle beat, 
Keep me safe with your hands 
And feel the heat, it makes me wanna dance. 

I'm fine, like a charm, 
Resting here on your arm and you're taking my breath away.

I'm fine like a charm, 
Resting here on your arm and you're making me wanna stay.
