I still regret
I turned my back on you
No one makes me feel the way you do
Never meant to cause you trouble
Never meant to do you harm
I was weakened by temptation's wing of charm

I want to be forgiven
I want to hold you in my arms again
To be forgiven
'Cause I still need a friend

I want to be forgiven
I want to hold you in my arms again
To be forgiven
'Cause I still need a friend
I want to be forgiven

Almost drowning in the sea of sin
Can you ease the pain I feel within
Never meant to cause you trouble
Never meant to do you harm
I was weakened by temptation's wing of charm

I want to be forgiven
I want to hold you in my arms again
To be forgiven
'Cause I still need a friend

I want to be forgiven
I want to hold you in my arms again
To be forgiven
'Cause I still need a friend
I want to be forgiven

Never meant to cause you trouble
Never meant to do you harm
I was weakened by temptation's wing of charm 

Never meant to cause you trouble
Never meant to do you harm
I was weakened by temptation's wing of charm

I want to be forgiven
I want to hold you in my arms again
To be forgiven
'Cause I still need a friend

I want to be forgiven
I want to hold you in my arms again
To be forgiven
'Cause I still need a friend

I want to be forgiven
I want to hold you in my arms again
To be forgiven
'Cause I still need a friend
I want to be forgiven
