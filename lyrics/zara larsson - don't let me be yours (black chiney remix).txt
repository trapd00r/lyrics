I may know myself, but I realize I can't be let astray
I know, I know that you're bad for my head
But I don't care I want you anyway

Boy, you think that you know me
Oh, but you can't see my lonely heart
Things look different in the morning
That's when we find out who we are
Would you still hold me?
Without no makeup on my face
Without alcohol in your vase
Oh, would you baby?
Would you still love me?
With all the promises you make
Would you still mean the words you say?
Oh, would you baby? Yeah

You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be

We may look like hell when it's 6 AM
But it's heaven in despair
I know, I know, I know that you can tell
That we're more than friends
And it's not just in our heads
Yeah, yeah

Boy, you think that you know me
Oh, but you can't see my lonely heart
Things look different in the morning, yeah
That's when we find out who we are
Would you still hold me?
Without no makeup on my face?
Without alcohol in your vase?
Oh, would, you baby?
Would you still love me?
With all the promises you make
Would you still mean the words you say?
Oh, would you, baby?

You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be

Boy, you think that you know me
Oh, but you can't see my lonely heart
Things look different in the morning
That's when we find out who we are

You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours
You know everybody makes mistakes
Don't let me be yours, no, don't let me be
