I don't know where I go
When I go
I only know it's very far from home

And I don't know where you are
Either
But I know you're very far from home

I long for you
I see you in my dreams so clearly
But when I wake up
I'm alone and I don't know where you've gone
But I know it's very far from home

No one knows where I go
When I go
Oh, they don't know I'm so far from home

And it's my fault
That you got lost
Oh, let me create something other than trouble

Oh, let me find you
Let me mind you
Even if it has to be very far from home

I long for you
I see you in my dreams so clearly
But when I wake up
I'm alone and I don't know where you've gone
But I know it's very far from home
It's very far from home
