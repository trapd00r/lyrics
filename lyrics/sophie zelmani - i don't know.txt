Are you scared, are you worried too?
For how far you and I will go
Have you noticed we're part of this town
There are divorces and break ups all around

I don't know if it feels good 
to say, we did the best we could

There's so many people, everywhere 
that we are letting interfere
And if someone's good enough 
it could be the end for us

I don't know if it's enough
to say it's only up to us

I don't know if it feels good
I don't know if it feels good
I don't know if it feels good
we did the best we clould
