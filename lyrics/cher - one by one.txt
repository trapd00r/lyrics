When you pray with every breath
You know, that is free
As the love you have
Where does it end
It's too much for me to take

There's no peace
You close your eyes
I'm all out of truth
I'm out of alibis
Where does it end
It's too much for me to take

Chorus:

We're gonna love one another
' Til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation
For what we've done
Give up resisting one by one
One by one
He gives a new kind of meaning
To what I am
I know that I could never
Love any other man
One of these days he'll understand
Understand

And his face his heaven scent
He makes me believe there
Must be something else
Where does it end
It's too much for me to take

I can feel the need in you
There isn't a thing
I won't let you do
Where does it end
It's too much for me to take

We're gonna love one another
' Til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation
For what we've done
Give up resisting one by one
One by one
He gives a new kind of meaning
To what I am
I know that I could never
Love any other man
One of these days he'll understand
Understand

Understand

We're gonna love one another
' Til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation
For what we've done
Give up resisting one by one
One by one
He gives a new kind of meaning
To what I am
I know that I could never
Love any other man
One of these days he'll understand
Understand

We're gonna love one another
' Til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation
For what we've done
Give up resisting one by one
One by one

We're gonna love one another
We're gonna love one another
Give up resisting one by one
One by one
