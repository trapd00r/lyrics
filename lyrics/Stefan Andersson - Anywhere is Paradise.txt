Some people got to live on a big city street
So crowded and noisy, can't hear their heartbeat
Someway they stay in their own hometown
Others kind of' like it keep moving around

But baby I could live near or far
Anywhere between here and some shooting star
As long as I'm always where you are

Cause anywhere is paradise when you're with the one you love,
Anywhere is a place that's nice when you're with the one you dream of,
Anywhere is paradise when you're with a love that's true
There's nowhere I'd rather be baby than anywhere with you

Some people want to be where the big money is
Some want to be in Hollywood showbiz
Some got to be where they know what things mean
Others just want to be where I can be seen

But baby anywhere for me will do
Anywhere between here and that far off moon
As long as I'm always there with you

Cause anywhere is paradise when you're with the one you love,
Anywhere is a place that's nice when you're with the one you dream of,
Anywhere is paradise when you're with a love that's true
There's nowhere I'd rather be baby than anywhere with you

Your heart and mine joined together like hand and glove
We already found our forever on earth as in heaven above
So baby, anywhere will do for me 
Cause' wherever in the world we'll ever be 
Will always be the land of love

Cause anywhere is paradise when you're with the one you love,
Anywhere is twice as nice when you're with the one you dream of,
Anywhere is paradise nothing could be more true
There's nowhere I'd rather be baby than anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
