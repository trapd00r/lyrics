Please put me to sleep
If there's room beneath your feet
See, i've left my home
I couldn't get used to living alone

Put me to rest
Lay your head on my chest
Hold my hand
When you leave don't wake me up
Just to see how you say goodbye

Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
God, i've waited so long
Maybe my time has come
To walk by your side

Please put me at ease
now my soul is ready for peace
Give me the lovers curse
Now i'm ready for your,
my rebel, my hope.
