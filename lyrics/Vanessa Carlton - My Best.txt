Mm-mm-mm-mmmm-mm-mm 
We scream and shout 
And try to make it last 
Though it didn't work out 
I don't love you any less 

My lover or friend 
I won't ever tell 
Our secret's safe 
An unspoken citadel 

And in these broken times 
Well, it's so easy to forget 
So I sing to remind 
Upon my shoulder you can rest 
'Cause I'll always give you my best 

A sidewalk's path leads me to you 
Though we don't look back 
We hold on to a truth 

And in these broken times 
I promise I will not forget 
Though you're not mine 
Upon your shoulder I can rest 
'Cause you always give me your best 

It's like a promise kept 
It's like you never left 
It's like you never left 

Mm-mm-mm-mmmm-mm-mm 
Ah-ah-ah-ahhh-ah-ah 

I know it's been so long 
I can't ever seem to forget 
All it takes is a song 
And I could swear I hear your steps 
Down the hall that goes up past 
That leaves an ache 
It's never left 
'Cause I gave you my best 
Ahhhh 

It's like you never left 
It's like you never left 

Ah-ah-ah-ahhh-ah-ah 
We scream and shout 
And try to make it last
