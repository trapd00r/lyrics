Forge our song
From blood and steel
Embers of Earth
And endless tears
How cold is human life

Born in the dark
With limited sight
We run from each other
Fearing the night
We painted the sky
With stars as our guides

Connecting the lines
We brought them to life
With faces and names
We gave them our traits
Both gods and men are one in the same

Don’t close your eyes
Death comes to cowards who hide
Set fire to the skies of the earth
And let their monuments burn
Every trace of their race
Will be burned and erased
Their culture debased
For our god shall replace

Don’t close your eyes
Behold the human design
The day has come
For all to witness the final war
Every trace of their race
Will be burned and erased
Their culture debased
For our god shall replace

Oh, cruel blacksmith
Imbued without fear
The wails of your hammer
Sing so perfectly clear

We march in endless waves
Atop their nameless graves
Unleashing our weapons to remind our enemies
We have no use for slaves

Don’t close your eyes
And witness our value of life
From the seas to the sky of the earth
Now watch it all burn
Every trace of our race
will be burned and erased
Our culture debased
For our god shall replace

Don’t close your eyes
Behold this human design
They advance in endless waves
Atop our nameless graves
Every trace of our race
Will be burned and erased
Our culture debased
For our god shall replace

A world that we see
Plagued by deceit
A fate of the world
In the hands of belief
Exile or death
To fight or to flee
Is this what it means to be free
Born from the ashes of earth we sleep
Is this what it means to be free

Once and for all
One by one
All humans shall fall

The essence of peace
Broken and weak
As martyrs will clam
We kill in their name

A life to regain
Is a life worth disdain
When the only world left
Has been consumed in flames

Don’t close your eyes
All witness the value of life
All prayers will be lost in the storm
Plague, disease, famine, and war
Every trace of this race
Will be burned and erased
All culture debased
All gods are replaced

Don’t close your eyes
All witness the final sunrise
Beyond the sun
Lies the last human source
Every trace of this race
Will be burned and erased
Their culture debased
For our god shall replace

A world that we see
Plagued by deceit
A fate of the world
In the hands of belief
Exile or death
To fight or to flee
Is this what it means to be free
Born from the ashes of earth we sleep
Is this what it means to be free

Our world laid to waste
By the forces of faith
Divided by race
And walls of a state
Unleashing a wave
Of violence and pain
The essence of man
Has been raped and betrayed

The structures in place
Hasten unto the day
The foundations below
Begin to give way

The failed to contain
The truth
God and men
Are one in the same
