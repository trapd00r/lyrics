Well, my name, it is Sam Hall, Sam Hall.
Yes, my name, it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall.
My name it is Sam Hall, and I hate you, one and all.

I killed a man, they said, so they said.
I killed a man, they said, so they said.
I killed a man, they said, and I smashed in his head.
And I left him layin' dead,
Damn his eyes!

But a-swingin' I must go, I must go.
A-swingin' I must go, I must go.
A-swingin' I must go while you critters down below
Yell up "Sam, I told you so",
Well, damn your eyes!

I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd.
I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd.
I saw Molly in the crowd, and I hollered, right out loud:

Then the Sherriff, he came, too, he came, too.
Ah, yeah, the Sherriff, he came, too, he came, too.
The Sherriff, he came, too, and he said "Sam, how are you?"
And I said, "Well, Sherriff, how are you? Damn your eyes!"

My name is Samuel, Samuel.
My name is Samuel, Samuel.
My name is Samuel, and I'll see you all in hell!
An' I'll see you all in hell,
Damn your eyes!
