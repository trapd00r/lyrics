I had a baby
And he looks just like me
A bald-headed baby
He's been the makings of me

His eyes are so blue, just like you
But you haven't seen him
And I don't know what to tell him
I don't know what to tell him

I had a thing with
A man who wasn't mine to be with
I woke up one June day
With him up inside me

And it excited me 
And I was crazy
I was always crazy

But I had a baby
So I'm never sorry
He's been the makings of me

And when he asks I tell him
That you love him but you can't be here
And when he says why
I say I don't know why
Because I don't know why

He should suffer instead of me
Over shit that's because of me
Oh, I wish it wasn't so crazy
Broke my mind till this day

But I had a baby
So beautifully
He's been the makings of me

I had a fling with
A man who wasn't mine to be with
I woke up one June day
With him up inside me

And it excited me
(I was crazy) I was crazy
(Oh) I was always crazy
