On the dunes of bad taste
I surf beneath the burning moon.
The heat peels off my skin
But I won't hife like the other fools

Beyond hypnosis
Beyond the norm
Beyond the hypocrites
Melt the cerebrae

I'm a man of low morals, and everything
I touch ends up crushed into dust

On the shores of brain attack
I bathe above the lava core.
The fumes keep away the ordinary.
With a smile I plunge and dive.

I'm a man of low morals, and everything
I touch ends up crushed into dust

Beyond hypnosis
Beyond the norm
Beyond the hypocrites
Melt the cerebrae

I'm a man of low morals, and everything
I touch ends up crushed into dust
Satisfaction, downfall.
My teeth kissed concrete once again.
Flesh dripping grin
