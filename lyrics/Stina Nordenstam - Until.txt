'Til I give you up
'Til you give in
Stop the car
Turn off the engine
Wake up at night with a pounding heart

'Til you go down
Loose your head
Stop unconscious
From your bed
Until you walk from bar to bar

Until

Until you're scourged
Until you're snared
Reminded by the clothes you wear
Galled and sticky with desire

'Til any touch
Is hard to bare
'Til nothing counts
'Til you don't care
Until your only thought is 'why'?

Until you bleed
Until you cry
Until you hurt as much as I

Until 'until' electrifies
Your ragged face
Your sleepless eyes
