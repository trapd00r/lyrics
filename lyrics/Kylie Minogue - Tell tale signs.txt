You never send me flowers
You don't wanna hold my hand
When I was sad or lonely
You used to understand
Maybe these are the tell tale signs
Of our love slipping away

You never say you love me
You never kiss me anymore
When I come home late
You never meet me at the door
Maybe these are the tell tale signs
Of our love slipping away

Anniversaries come and go
They're just another day
Remember when our love was new
The promises we made
Love was so exciting
The feelings were brand new
But that's another place and time
And another you

Can there be a happy ending
Is there any turning back
Or have we fallen into
That same old lover's trap
We see all the tell tale signs
Let's stop our love slipping away
We've seen all the tell tale signs
Of our love slipping away
