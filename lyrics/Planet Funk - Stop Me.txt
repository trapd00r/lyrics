Looking for the soul in a plastic world
Looking for the skin on my plastic girl, oh yeah
Champagne smile and a camera flash
Bubble gum lips in a bubble bath, oh yeah

Won't you stop me, stop me, stop me
It wasn't my dream but it fits like a glove
Nano narcotic bringing peace and love, oh yeah
Could you help me scratch my electric itch
It makes me look good but it's starting to make me twitch

Won't you stop me, stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me

Sending me the message, it's crawling underneath my skin
Sending me the message, it's crawling underneath my skin
Sending me the message...

Looking for the soul in a plastic world
Looking for the skin on my plastic girl, oh yeah
Champagne smile and a camera flash
Bubble gum lips in a bubble bath, oh yeah

Won't you stop me, stop me, stop me

Sending me the message, it's crawling underneath my skin
Sending me the message, it's crawling underneath my skin
Sending me the message...

Won't you stop me
Won't you stop me

Won't you stop me, stop me, stop me
Stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me

Won't you stop me
