Everywhere I turn, I hurt someone
But there's nothing I can say to change the things I've done
Of all the things I hid from you
I cannot hide the shame
And I pray someone, something will come to take away the pain

There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
I can't face another day

Tell me where, did I go wrong
Everyone I loved, they're all gone
I'd do everything differently but I can't turn back the time
There's no shelter from the storm inside of me

Oh, there's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
I can't face another day

I can't believe the words I hear
It's like an answer to a prayer
When I look around I see
This place, this time, this friend of mine

I know its hard but you found somehow
To look into your heart and to forgive me now
You've given me the strength to see just where my journey ends
You've given me the strength to carry on and on

Oh, I see the path from this dark place
I see my future
Your forgiveness has set me free
On and I can see another way
I can face another day, yeah

I see the path, I can see the path
I see the future
I see the path from this dark place
I see the future

I see the path, I can see the path
I see the future
