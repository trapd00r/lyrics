One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, countin'

One, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
Everybody loves ooh, shoutin'

One, two
One-one-one, two, three
Countin', one, two
Countin', one-one, two three

Babe, pick a night
To come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?

Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twisted on the floor
What do you say?

Are you in?
Livin' in sin is the new thing, yeah
Are you in?
I am counting

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, counting

One, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
Everybody loves ooh, shoutin'

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, countin'

One, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
Everybody loves, ooh

Three is a charm
Two is not the same
I don't see the harm
So are you game?

Let's make a team
Make 'em say my name
Lovin' the extreme
Now are you game?

Are you in?
Livin' in sin is the new thing, yeah
Are you in?
I am countin'

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, countin'

One, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
Everybody loves ooh, shoutin'

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, countin'

One, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
Everybody loves, ooh

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothin' meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it, you and me

You and me
Or three
Or four
On the floor

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, countin'

One, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
Everybody loves ooh, shoutin'

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between, countin'

One, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3-P
