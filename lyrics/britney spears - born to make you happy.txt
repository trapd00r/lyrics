Oh, my love
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

I'm sitting here alone up in my room
And thinking 'bout the times that we've been through, oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand, trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong with the love that felt so strong

If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

(I don't know how to live without your love)
I was born to make you happy
('Cause you're the only one within my heart)
I was born to make you happy

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
(I don't know how to live without your love)
I was born to make you happy

I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd rather give it up then carry on, oh, my love
'Cause livin' in a dream of you and me is not the way my life should be
I don't wanna cry a tear for you, so forgive me if I do

If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right

(I don't know how to live without your love)
I was born to make you happy
('Cause you're the only one within my heart)
I was born to make you happy

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
(I don't know how to live without your love)
I was born to make you happy

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I'd do anything, I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl
(Just call out my name) Just call out my name
(I will be there) And I will be there
Just to show you how much I care

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I was born to make you happy
Yeah, oho
Oh, yeah

(I don't know how to live without your love)
I was born to make you happy
('Cause you're the only one within my heart)
I was born to make you happy

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
(I don't know how to live without your love)
I was born to make you happy
I was born to make you happy

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Always and forever you and me
That's the way our life should be
(I don't know how to live without your love)
I was born to make you happy
