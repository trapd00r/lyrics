I know you want a gangsta I know you need a thug
Someone that's always by your side that you can kiss and hug
Ill always be there whether times are bad or times are ruff
Come put your lips on mine come get some of this criminal love
I know you want a soldier I know you need a thug
Someone that's always by your side that you can kiss and hug
I will always be there whether times are bad or times are ruff
Come put your arms around me and get some of this criminal love

Girl come and get some of this criminal love I've been missing you for a while
Been waitin for a hug and I've been feelin' and feelin' just waitin for a kiss and
While we're at it just let me put these diamonds on your wrist Now baby girl
You know I love you and that's with my soul you bring some warmth into my
Heart beat 'cause these streets are cold and when I'm tourin and travelin all
Around the world I always come home to my one and only baby girl its
Straight love and thug passion a bond that's everlasting tryin' to put us in a
Mansion with this rap shit they touch away from home alot trying to make it
On this journey all the way to the top and for always stayin by my side I love
You for that never wanted me to leave patiently waitin till I'm back too much
Love to express just on one track just know I love you till I die and that's a
Fact baby girl

And when I get home you always show this criminal love and when I was
Locked down you always sent me letters with with love and when I was stuck
On stupid it's like I got shot by cupid I don't know what it was but it was just
Something that you did or should I say that you do you say I love you me too
And baby girl until I die its just me and you and that's a promise to be honest
You've been one of the strongest always by my side and down to ride when
Troubles upon us and I know sometimes in life I leave you crossed and
Stressed always work never rest and always cleanin up my mess the drama
Never dies sometimes it spreads and multiplies but still no matter what
Against all odds we rise uh huh and lie together cry together I swear to god i
Hope we fuckin' die together they say that youngsters don't make it but we've
Been makin' it for years always making it work through all the drama and
Tears and that's a fact

Remember the times I used to call when I was away in placement couldn't wait
Till I seen you but still I had to stay patient then I came home and took what
Was rightfully mine and I was feelin' for your love I really couldn't waste no
Time but still we had our problems still had our ups and downs and I was still
Catching cases I couldn't put away the pounds another days another dollar
Was the way I moved around to this day its still the same except the hustle is
Legal now and I'm never around always pursuing my dreams settin my goals
High so we could enjoy life's finer things diamond pen and tennis bracelets
Full of ice and precious things and I'm proud to say I love you ook what hard
Work brings and I would walk a million miles just to see those lips smile
