I have looked so long for lovem
I think I got to give it up
My heart has had enough
From now on, I think I gonna live it up

I'll never let someone hurt me again
If they knock I just wont let them in

Who's that boy
You can always make exceptions
Who's that boy
He's got my full attention
I could use that boy
To get me some affection
Tell me what's his name

Who's that boy
I need a quick identification
Who's that boy
Here I go again
I could use that boy
If I don't make my move right now
I don't wanna choose right now, oh no
What else can I do

I all thru with playing games
I'm tired being treated rough
Maybe you can see I've changed
From now on, I'm not a little powder puff

I wont give in like some misguided fool
I promise to live by that rule

Who's that boy
You can alway make exceptions
Who's that boy
He's got my full attention
I could use that boy
To get me some affection
Tell me what's his name

Who's that boy
I need a quick identification
Who's that boy
Here I go again
I could use that boy
If I don't make my move right now
I don't wanna choose right now, oh no
But what else can I do

(Talked)
Who's that boy?
I wanna show him what love is
Hey boy... I've got something I wanna show you (giggle)

Who's that boy
You can alway make exceptions
Who's that boy
He's got my full attention
I could use that boy
To get me some affection
Tell me what's his name

Who's that boy
I need a quick identification
Who's that boy
Here I go again
I could use that boy
If I don't make my move right now
I don't wanna choose right now, oh no

Who's that boy
You can alway make exceptions
Who's that boy
He's got my full attention
I could use that boy
To get me some affection
Tell me what's his name

Who's that boy
You can alway make exceptions
Who's that boy
He's got my full attention
I could use that boy
To get me some affection
Tell me what's his name

Who's that boy
I need a quick identification
Who's that boy
Here I go again
I could use that boy
If I don't make my move right now
I don't wanna choose right now, oh no
