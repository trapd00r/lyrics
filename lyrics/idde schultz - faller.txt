Ya�ll know what hot to me
When she tongue tied can�t talk to me
Not with a man not with the band
with the best girlfriend and the shit ain�t planned
so unscripted, unpredicted who would of thought
who would of thought they�d both be with it
they lifted to much liquid why not risk it
shit get addicted
you could say you was drunk, bunk
out that score when the baseline thump
let that go, feel my flow
when shit jump off its real i know
everyone�s watchin we out in public
i think its awesome, everyone loves it
do you, that cant be forced
let nature take its course

i like when girls kiss girls

she�s sexy I aint mad
ya’ll tryin to impress me
I find that rad
but i got nexy
girl im bad
thats if she lets me
girl i dont grab
not to brag
but ill knock your socks off
ill be glad to make the three way pop off
they got my hype
got me right
got me light
lets bring fantasies to life
so core
need little
and a freeze in my mic.
their my kinda girls
why be shy
lets get good
then nighty night
ya’ll act out
what she think about
then we all smiles
and she all pouts
i scout, for talent no doubt
make ladies kiss, twist and shout
