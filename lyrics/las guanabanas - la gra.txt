How long have I known you?
I think of you as my best friend
You've hear accusations
About me and your girlfriend
I can't believe you don't trust me
After all that we've been through
I've got a heart and a conscience
And I'd never do that to you
Yeah that's a lie
I didn't sleep with your woman
We stayed awake all night
I'm telling the truth
I heard her whispering your name boy
While I was holding her tight
Everybody tells you
That I am the backdoor man
Sneaking round stealing love
Wherever I can
Well that's just gossip and rumors
Yeah, you need to hear it from me
Yes you do
I'm gonna' look you straight in the eyes
Cause the truth will set me free
Yeah that's a lie
I didn't sleep with your woman
We stayed awake all night
I'm telling the truth
I heard her whispering your name boy
While I was holding her tight
