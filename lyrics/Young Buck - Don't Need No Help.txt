Fuck Tha Police!

Think about it every time you bitches come around (yeah)
Either we runnin' or we layin' on the fuckin' ground (come on)
Just look at Chris a nigga popped and shot him in the club
They called the ambulance and y'all dan't even show up (bang)
Oh let me tell you about La Ricky when he took his bullets (ok)
You want the trigger man, y'all was the ones that pull it (oh)
That's why we represent them niggaz like Larry Davis
Before he let you cowards kill him, he just came and sprayed it (come on)
Now what you wan' do (whooo whooo), bitch I got a gun too (whooo, whooo)
We gon' keep on sendin' shots (whooo, whooo), every time y'all come through (whooo, whooo)
Got the nerve to tell him nigga put his hands up
And beat him to the ground (yeah), when they put the boy in handcuffs

Fuck, Fuck tha police, we handle it ourselves
Even if I beat to death (yeah), nigga we don't need no motherfuckin' help!
And to the right (what), to the left (what), let 'um know (what)
We don't need no motherfuckin' help! (Bo!)

Fuck Tha Police (whooo, whooo), Fuck Tha Law (whooo, whooo)
Fuck Tha Police (whooo, whooo), we don't need no motherfuckin' help! (fuck 'um all)
Fuck Tha Police (whooo, whooo), Fuck Tha Law (whooo, whooo)
Fuck Tha Police (whooo, whooo), we don't need no motherfuckin' help! (fuck 'um all)

We used to play cops and robbers as a little kid (come on)
Whoever was the pigs we would go and split his wig (haha)
And as the years passed, niggaz only got worse
Jumped in to the game, shit, gotta put ?? (what up nigga)
We had enough of gettin' handcuffed and pulled over
We started tryin' knock they heads off they fuckin' shoulders (boom)
Now where my soldiers at, get ready for combat
I'm livin' like them niggaz that dunn went to Vietnam, hey (G-Unit!)
So if you try to lock me up for smokin' my weed (whooo, whooo... whooo, whooo)
The whole force of police, is what they gon' need (whooo, whooo... whooo, whooo)
One of a kind, I'm the last of a dying breed
Even the one that was before me, he was sayin'..

Fuck tha police, we handle it ourselves
Even if I beat to death (yeah), nigga we don't need no motherfuckin' help!
And to the right (what), to the left (what), let 'um know (what)
We don't need no motherfuckin' help! (Bo!)

Fuck Tha Police (whooo, whooo), Fuck Tha Law (whooo, whooo)
Fuck Tha Police (whooo, whooo), we don't need no motherfuckin' help! (fuck 'um all)
Fuck Tha Police (whooo, whooo), Fuck Tha Law (whooo, whooo)
