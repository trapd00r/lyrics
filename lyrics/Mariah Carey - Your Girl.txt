See, I used to be so shy
Sit at home and fantasize
(I should be your girl)
But I ain't wastin' no more time
'Cause I've got to make you mine

I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

See I used to be afraid
But now baby I can't wait
I just gotta have your love
And enough's enough's enough

I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly
I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

Sipping on ex and havin' loss of stress I have a thought and a feeling come into my mind

LOVE
YOU
SO
MUCH
