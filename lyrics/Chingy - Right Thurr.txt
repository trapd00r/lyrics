(Intro)
Uh hey dirty (what) 
Look at that girl right thurr (uh) 
She make me say (ohh) 
Oohhh oh oh 
Do whatchu do 

(Chorus) 
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr) 
Switch ya hips when you're walkin, let down your hair (down your hair) 
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr) 
Lick ya lips when you talkin, that make me stare (make me stare) 

(Verse 1)
I like the way you look in them pants, shit you fine (fine) 
Lil mama a quarter piece, she far from a dime (dime) 
The type of girl that getchu up and go make you grind (grind) 
I'm thinkin bout snatchn' her up 
Dirty, making her mine 
Look at her hips, look at her legs, Ain't she stacked (stacked) 
I sure wouldn't mind hittn' that from the back (back) 
I like it when I touch her, cuz she moan a lil bit 
Jeans saggin', so I can see her thong a lil bit 
I know you grown a lil bit, 20 years old, you legal 
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal 
I swoop on her like an eagle, swoop down on its prey 
I know your popular, but you gon be famous today 

(Chorus)  

(Verse 2)
She be shoppin at Frontenac, just look at her front and back 
Man she's so stacked, and she know that I want that 
Her man he so whack, girl can I taste your cat 
Gave her 300 to strip, like buying a throwback 
She stay in the club, like to be seen she got it honest 
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas 
She be at events, stop the press when she pass 
All the high rollin' cats, wanna pay for that... 
Ain't no half steppin', strapped with a nice weapon, trip 
It's against the law for her to move them hips 
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gone drop 
World wide, fools probably tell you this off tops,

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
I like it when she doing that (come on) 
Plus I like it when she bring it back 
Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh do what you do 
I like it when she doing that (uhhh) 
Plus I like it when she bring it back 
Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh do what you do 

(Verse 3)
Gimme what you got for a pork chop (uh) 
She threw it at me like I was a shortstop (uh) 
Twerkin in a phatty girl halter top 
Then she backed it up on me, and let it drop (drop) 
Make it hop (boing) , like a bunny (bunny) 
Girl can I touch you where it's sunny 
Her appearance will make you give her some money 
She should pose for sports illustriated 
It's like a picture perfect site 
When she pass all the other girls hate it, but

(Chorus)

(Outro)
I like that (uh huh) 
I like that (uh huh) 
I like that (uh huh) 
I like that, Track Stars oh oh oh 
Do what you do

I like that (yeah) 
I like that (yeah) 
I like that (yeah) 
I like that, Chingy oh oh oh oh
Do what you do
