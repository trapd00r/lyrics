[Avant] 
I been looking for you for a long damn time 
But you been gone away i nearly lost my mind 
And now we're in the club and you're grindin on me.. touchin on me.. got me goin crazy 
that skirt you wearin got a playa on stroll 
As i glance at my watch i see the night is growin old 
I start to reminse about when we were shorties, back seat of my jeep, yes i'm feelin horny 
As i play my position posted up on the wall 
Happy to hear the DJ say last call 
Cause what that means is we about to leave and i'm about to be all up on you and you up on me 


[Chorus] 
Cause I want you 
in the middle of the night i'm gonna rub 
and if you let me go down i'm gonna taste 
And if it's all said and done i'm gonna 
you know what 
you know what 
Cause I want you 
in the middle of the night i'm gonna rub you 
and if you let me go down i'm gonna taste you 
And if it's all said and done i'm gonna 
you know what 
you know what 


[Avant] 
It's hard to keep in touch while you're off in school 
but now you're right here we can do what we do 
Start in the car and end up in the livin room 
Kiss around your navel while you're on the end table 
Pushed the magazines down on the floor, I'm your soldier so i'm ready to go to war 
And you told me you're hot and you're ready 
Legs won't stop shakin, just give it to me daddy 
And i like the way your body's lookin right there 
Knowin we might not even make it upstairs 
And what that means is just relax your mind and baby let it flow it's goin down and that's for sho 

[Chorus] 
Cause I want you 
in the middle of the night i'm gonna rub 
and if you let me go down i'm gonna taste 
And if it's all said and done i'm gonna 
you know what 
you know what 
Cause I want you 
in the middle of the night i'm gonna rub you 
and if you let me go down i'm gonna taste you 
And if it's all said and done i'm gonna 
you know what 
you know what 


[Lil' Wayne] 
Get fresh off the g.fo 
need no intro 
weezy baby nympho 
him so..gentle with it 
Still got mamis limpo 
little woody put his thang down like my tempo 
Young dude, rich, smart,humble 
Got something downlow to make your balls crumble 
Not rough though, slowmo, promo.. we could go video.. uh uh true that's right 
Nasty that's all in me.. how he rappin got women like he R&B 
What you know about your legs in the air, with your head in the chair, with my hands in your hair 
We could go there if what i'm sayin sounds fair 
Don't trip I kiss every lip don't flip 
Flip up the doors on the out of country whip 
I could take you out of this world baby let's dip 

[Chorus] 
Cause I want you 
in the middle of the night i'm gonna rub 
and if you let me go down i'm gonna taste 
And if it's all said and done i'm gonna 
you know what 
you know what 
Cause I want you 
in the middle of the night i'm gonna rub 
and if you let me go down i'm gonna taste 
And if it's all said and done i'm gonna 
you know what 
you know what
