Reverberating choirs
A sea of faces black
A leviathan, in iron dreams entrapped

From the throat of pandemonium
An unrelenting scourge
Bible black, archaic madness writhes

The lingering
Presence of
Inescapable death

Into the palace of lepers
Citadel of disease
Into the palace of lepers

Fathomless the craters
Fanaticism masked
The phantasm, now drowning in ash

Aesthetics reproducing
A hierarchy intact
Propaganda, blind serpent's dance

The lingering
Presence of
Inescapable death

Into the palace of lepers
Citadel of disease
Into the palace of lepers

A clawing nightmare blind
A grinning march of death
A clawing nightmare blind
A grinning march of death

A grinning march of death

Chants reverberate
Through these halls
The corridors of doom
Chants reverberate
Through these halls
The corridors of doom
