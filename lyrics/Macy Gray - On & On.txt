I've been drinking, I'm high
I have a lot to say
I never get so down
It's when you go away

From the bottom of my heart
From the red of my blood
What I feel is real
And baby, I'm in love

I want ya, I need ya, I love ya
(On and on and on)
Wanna discuss the future
Can't get enough
(On and on and on)

You body, baby, makes me
(On and on and on)
And I could go on and on, on and on
About how I feel about you

There's no end in sight
I can't imagine what
My life would be like

I wanna talk about the future
From the bottom of my heart
The red of my blood
Baby, I'm in love

Yeah, summer's commence
Oh, wintertime and it's you
Baby, all the time
And you stay on my mind

I want ya, I need ya, I love ya
(On and on and on)
Wanna discuss the future
Can't get enough
(On and on and on)

You body, baby, makes me
(On and on and on)
I could go on and on, on and on
On and on with you

I want ya, I need ya, I love ya
(On and on and on)
Wanna discuss the future
Can't get enough
(On and on and on)

When I see you wanna pull my skirt up
Got me feeling like I'm 'bout to burn up
Got me feeling hot, baby, put your hands up
'Cause, baby, it's a hold up

So love me, I can make you love me
Always into me
You're what I want, what I need
Love what you're doing to me

I want ya, I need ya, I love ya
(On and on and on)
Wanna discuss the future
Can't get enough
(On and on and on)

You body, baby, makes me
(On and on and on)
I could go on and on and on
On and on with you
