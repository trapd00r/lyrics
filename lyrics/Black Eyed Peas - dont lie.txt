Will.i.am
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to you
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

Fergie
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie
'Cause you know-know-know-know, yeah you know-know-know-know you gotta try
What you're gonna do when it all comes out?
When I really see you and what you're all about?
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know, you know you gotta try

(Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop, stop lying)

Apl.de.ap
She said I'm leaving
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryna maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

Fergie and apl.de.ap
Oh oh, and I lie, and I lie, and I lie, and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cause I lie, and I lie, and a little lie-lie
And now your emotions are drained

Fergie
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie (ooh, don't-don't you lie)
'Cause you know-know-know-know, yeah you know-know-know-know you gotta try (got to try, got to try)
What you're gonna do when it all comes out? (what you're gonna do baby?)
When I really see you and what you're all about?
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know, you know you gotta try

Taboo
Yo, I'm lyin' to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I'm lyin' to my girl, I do it

Fergie and Taboo
Oh oh, and I lie, and I lie, and I lie (and then I lie)
Till there's no turning back (I don't know why I lie and I lie)
And I lie, and I lie till I don't know who I am
And then I tell myself

Fergie
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie (don't you lie!)
'Cause you know-know-know-know, yeah you know-know-know-know you gotta try (you know, you know you gotta)
What you're gonna do when it all comes out?
When I really see you and what you're all about?
No no no no, baby, no no no no, don't lie

No no no no, baby, no no no no
(Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop, stop lying)
