Well it´s crying time again
you´re gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling uhmm uhmm uhhh
that it won´t be long before it´s crying time

now, they say that absent makes the heart grow founder
and that tears are only rain to make love grow
well my love for you could never grow no stronger no
if i´d live to be a hundred years old

oh, its crying time again
you´re gonna leave me 
i can see that far away look in your eyes
i can tell by the way you hold me darling
that it wont be long before it´s crying time



Now you say you found someone that you love better
Well thats the way it happened every time before
and as sure as the sun comes out tomorrow
crying time will start
when you walk out the door

oh, its crying time again
you´re gonna leave me 
i can see that far away look in your eyes
i can tell by the way you hold me darling
that it wont be long before it´s crying time

now it wont be long before it´s crying time

ooooh yeeah
