It's because to my faith
In how it should be
I never consider
And that's why I let you drive me, drive me crazy

It's not a question
Or try, oh ones fortune
What it's all about
Is to fight to make it live to make it live and survive

So stand by
Stand by
Stand by
Stand by

And I won't be scared
Of the hard times that will come
We'll get to a level
When we get through and then we just go on and on

So stand by
Stand by
Stand by
Stand by

Stand by
Stand by
Stand by
Stand by
