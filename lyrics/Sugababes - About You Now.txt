It was so easy that night.
Should've been strong, yeah, I lied.
Nobody gets me like you.

Couldn't keep hold of you then.
How could I know what you meant?
There was nothing to compare to.

I know everything changes.
All the cities and faces.
But I know how I feel about you.

There's a mountain between us,
But there's one thing I'm sure of:
That I know how I feel about you.

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now.

All that it takes: one more chance.
Don't let our last kiss be our last.
Give me tonight, and I'll show you.

I know everything changes.
I don't care where it takes us
'Cause I know how I feel about you.

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now.

Not a day pass me by,
Not a day pass me by,
When I don't think about you.
And there's no moving on
'Cause I know you're the one,
And I can't be without you.

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now.

Can we bring yesterday back around
'Cause I know how I feel about you now?
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down,
But I know how I feel about you now.

But I know how I feel about you now.

Yes, I know how I feel about you now.
