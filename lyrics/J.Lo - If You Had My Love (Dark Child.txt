Ay yo, you know what I feel like doing
I feel like doing another Darkchild Remix
'99, Darkchild, Jennifer
Come on and just dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now if I give you me (whoo!)
This is how it's got to be (uh-huh)
First of all I won't take you cheating on me (say what?)
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you 
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
(See that's what you told me, that's what you said)
But if you want me
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me baby

1 - If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you tryin' to get with me
And I end up unhappy
(I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain)
So before I do, give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

Repeat 1 (2x)

Come on and just dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little
Come on and just dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Darkchild, Jennifer Lopez, come on
