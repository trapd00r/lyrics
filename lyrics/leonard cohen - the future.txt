Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here, there's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby, that's an order

Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left 
Stuff it up the hole in your culture
Give me back the Berlin Wall 
Give me Stalin and Saint Paul
I've seen the future, brother, it is murder

Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing, nothing you can measure any more
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world 
Has crossed the threshold and it's overturned the order of the soul

When they said repent, repent
I wonder what they meant

You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew who wrote the bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival

Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future, it is murder

Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing, nothing you can measure any more
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world 
Has crossed the threshold and it's overturned the order of the soul

When they said repent, repent
I wonder what they meant

There'll be the breaking of the ancient Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms, there'll be fires on the road
And a white man dancing
You'll see a woman hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets come around
Trying to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancing

Give me back the Berlin Wall
Give me Stalin and Saint Paul
Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another foetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby, it is murder

Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing, nothing you can measure any more
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world 
Has crossed the threshold and it's overturned the order of the soul

When they said repent, repent
I wonder what they meant
