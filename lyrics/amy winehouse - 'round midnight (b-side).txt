It begins to tell,'round midnight, 'round midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown and suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad, 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
So when my heart is still with you
Yes ol' midnight knows it, too

For 'round midnight, when it comes around
So let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around, cause I'm feelin' sad,
And it really gets bad 'round midnight, 'round midnight
