My name is Diamond, yup, you've guessed it
Ran a thousand schemes, and I've never been arrested
I guess I'm lucky, 'cause I'm young and I'm a black man
And intelligent, so everything is relevant
Vision is clear, don't have to wear contacts
Got a good lawyer, no shorts in my contract
Beats are selected with the highest scrutiny
I play Mr. Christian and just take mutiny
Cause this is my destiny, a lotta brothers keep testin me
But you haven't heard the best from me
So remember one thing
Aiyo, it ain't no thing but a chicken wing
Yeah, so sit back, and listen to the chit-chat
Sweet as a kit-kat (Diamond, where'd you get that
Beat from?) Yo, Jazzy dug in the crate
Needs another loop, so we added a flute
Then it came together, and I grabbed a pen
Then I double-checked it (for what?) loose ends
The object of a song is to keep your head movin
Hope you find a good A&R man... (ha)
A lot of acts get signed
And when the album comes out everyone says
"Aw manm, take that record off, don't waste my time"
Due to that fact, I went for mine

I went for mine
Aiyo, I went for mine
I went for mine
So go for yours

I overcome hurdles like Edwin Moses
Everything is planned, but no one knows this
I never go broke, since I don't sweat that
I make moves like a man on X-Lax
D-i to the a-m to the o-n-d
Aiyo, you got no wins, gee
So back up and take a breather, cause either
You must be on acid or from Lake Placid
I hop to it like a kangaroo
I got jumped by a gang of two
But I showed them a thang or two
'Cause I'm not no chump
Now I clock notes 'cause I make you move your rump
Nothing's for granted, grew up in the projects
Used to wear Taylors and Chinese mock necks
Came a long way from back in the days
When Show went to Smith, and I went to Hayes
That was the past, and the future will be better
Pass the MoÃ«t and keep the Cream Armaretto
Peace to Greg Nice and my man Fat Joe
My man O.G. and the rest of the homies
The Zulu Nation for the foundation
From when I was a kid watchin _Lost In Space_, and
I never forget, 'cause I'm totally committed
To make slammin' joints, just to prove my point
In '92 you can't waste no time
(Word) go for yours, 'cause I went for mine

And you know that
And you don't stop
And you know that
'Cause I won't drop
I went for mine
Aiyo, I went for mine
And to my sister Eugenia
You're in the house
I went for mine
So go for yours, kid
And to my man Showbiz and all that
