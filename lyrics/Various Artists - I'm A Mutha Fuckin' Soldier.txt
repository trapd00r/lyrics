Talkin' to myself 'cause that's the realest nigga here
Had to see my people down and that's the only thing I fear
I been lookin' for the truth, should've been lookin' in the mirror
Tell my white girl I'm cut and she think that I'm just weird
I ain't never get no love so I find that shit weird
And I gotta taste of love, and it always taste like beer
Always put me on my rear, boy I think the devil here
And he standing on my shoulders tryna whisper my ear
Tryna influence my peers, tryna make me convert
Tryna put me in the hearse, put my whoadie on a shirt
Now I put my niggas first, 'cause all we did was hurt, yeah
All we do is serve baby, got guns like it's Nerf baby
You ain't ever learn baby, we the ones who murk baby
We the ones who gang bangin', all I hear is bullets rainin'
All I hear is mama sayin', I can peep these niggas faded
I can peep these niggas faded, you ain't peep my niggas dangerous

Better be ridin' like you sayin', better be ready when you land
Better be out here with a plan, better wake up with that lead
Better wake up to some head, better treat me like chef
Treat lil shorty like I'm deaf, better rock to the end
Better be ridin' like you sayin', better be ready when you land
Better be out here with a plan, better wake up with that lead
Better wake up to some head, better treat me like chef
Treat lil shorty like I'm deaf, better be rockin' to the end

Bet I put my trust in you, I'ma put my gun to use
Blow lil whoadie like a fruit, nigga sweeter than some fruit
Fuck the beat, I'm that dude, baby girl don't send no text
Baby girl love to flex, baby girl you got me flex
You ain't fell in love with me, you fell in love with Triple-X
I got rico right on deck, I don't reload, I'm on deck
Like an Xbox I connect, nigga run up, don't check
Niggas runnin' from the feds, every nigga doin' scams
Don't nobody got a job, taught myself how to rob
I was fly since I was born, I ain't never fuckin' crawl
Learned that you can't hit forever, you gon' get hit with the law
I don't rap, bitch I draw, this my motherfuckin' art
This ain't Soldier Kidd, bitch this is Nas
I'm from Palm Beach, where we livin' raw
I'm from Palm Beach, fourteen with a Glock
I'm from Palm Beach, fourteen, let it pop

Better be ridin' like you sayin', better be ready when you land
Better be out here with a plan, better wake up with that lead
Better wake up to some head, better treat me like chef
Treat lil shorty like I'm deaf, better rock to the end
Better be ridin' like you sayin', better be ready when you land
Better be out here with a plan, better wake up with that lead
Better wake up to some head, better treat me like chef
Treat lil shorty like I'm deaf, better be rockin' to the end
