Uh, check it out..
Walkin' through the ghetto and the feelin' is fine
Relaxation, no frustration
Cause it's time to get live
One hand whatches the other in this lonely street
No justice, no peace
Motherfuckers mo-il
So we struggle and strive
Niggas just to stay alive
I send fear in this pussy rappers rhymin' ok
Yo we speak what we feel
And what we feel must be real
Baby Pa, you know the deal...
