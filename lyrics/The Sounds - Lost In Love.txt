The Sounds - Lost in Love Lyrics

Everybody gets a little lost
Sometimes when you feel your time is running out
You know your love has stopped
When you feel alone and dreams from younger years
Are telling you its gone

Ask yourself why people fall apart
'Cause they don't realise
That something just ain't right

When you lay down on you pilow at home tonight
You gotta realise you're holding on
To something that ain't right

I believe in this fire burning inside of me
Never alone but you're always on your own
Lost in love and desire never again
I've lost myself I'll be searching for someone new

Smothered by his words
It's only freedom that you can't afford
To everyone but yourself

Down on luck tonight
You down down down
There's no way left to turn
Cause now you're all alone

Standing on the outside looking in
That is when I realise
This love don't mean a thing

I believe in this fire burning inside of me
Never alone but you're always on your own
Lost in love and desire never again,
I've lost myself I'll be searching for someone new

When you feel your troubles closing in
You gotta realise you're holding on
To something that ain't right.

I believe in this fire burning inside of me
Never alone but you're always on your own
Lost in love and desire, never again, never again,
Someone new
I believe in this fire
Burning inside of me

Lost in love and desire
Fire
I'm burning
