There are voices in the mirror, faces at the door
That open on the rivers we've never seen before
Are there choices for the sparrow, or does he only fly
High above the rivers that are pulling you and I

Oh, there are strange rivers, rivers that we cannot see
There are strange rivers who know our destiny
There are strange rivers who brought your love to me

He could have been a builder, he could have been the one
Who turned his dreams to steel cathedrals in the sun
He could have been a builder, until he bought the gun
There are forces in that river that keep him on the run

Oh, there are strange rivers, rivers that we cannot see
There are strange rivers who know our destiny
There are strange rivers who brought your love to me

Have you ever turned the corner and wondered why you did?
You haven't been that way since you were just a kid
Nothing really happens and then you have to say
You wonder what would happen had you gone the other way

Oh, there are strange rivers, rivers that we cannot see
There are strange rivers who know our destiny
There are strange rivers who brought your love to me
