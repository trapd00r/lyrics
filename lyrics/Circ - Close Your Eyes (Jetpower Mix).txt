Music...

Something you said
Has got me reeling again
Something you said
Has got me feeling again
Something you said, turned a key inside a lock inside of me
Something you said
Has got me dreaming again

Close your eyes
Don't surrender don't apologize
Close your eyes
Leave me something I can recognize
Wide awake I can feel the place
You used to be
And it's not too late
If you turn to me

Something you said
Has got me reeling again
Something you said
Has got me feeling again
Something you said turned a key inside a lock inside of me
Something you said
Has got me dreaming again

Close your eyes
Don't surrender don't apologize
Close your eyes
Leave me something I can recognize
Late at night hear the city sigh
Heartbeats collide
And it's not too late
If you answer why
