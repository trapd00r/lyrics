[1] On the wires I can hear you comin'
With a rush and a strummin'
This electric phase ain't no teenage craze
In your house a phone is ringin'
Just a hot touch that keeps lingerin'
You said loving's easy only if you please
All I need is communication
Not a line on your reputation
I don't want a handshake
There ain't no big mistake

[2] There's no illusion in this wild confusion
Who knows I'm crazy, no chance of maybe

I'd like to know you better
But I'm goin' down so fast
Help me now to feel it, I just can't conceal it
Meantime I've got to show you how it's really got to be
Just let me be alone, left with your darlin' tone
