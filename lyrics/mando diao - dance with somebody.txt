Break your happy home
Learn to sing alone 
To the music, to the music 
Clap your hands and shake 
On a summer's day 
To the music, to the music 

I'm falling in love with your favorite song 
I'm gonna sing it all night long 
I'm gonna dance with somebody 
Dance with somebody 
Dance, dance, dance 

I'm falling in love with your favorite song 
I'm gonna sing it all night long 
I'm gonna dance with somebody 
Dance with somebody 
Dance, dance, dance 

I'm gonna dance with somebody 

When you're all alone 
We become your home
We're the music, we're the music
When your love's away 
And you feel betrayed 
We're the music, sweet music! 

I'm falling in love with your favorite song 
I'm gonna sing it all night long 
I'm gonna dance with somebody 
Dance with somebody 
Dance, dance, dance 

I'm falling in love with your favorite song 
I'm gonna sing it all night long 
I'm gonna dance with somebody 
Dance with somebody 
Dance, dance, dance

(Dance), dance
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, (dance) (x10)
