Failures in outer space
Failures and crimes
Let's get something straight
It's not for mine, mine, mine, mine

It's before you were born
It's after you die
Failures in outer space
Failures and crimes

It's depth, whatever it's worth
It's in the unit to measure the curse
It's depth, whatever it's worth
It's in the unit to measure the curse

It's in the set-up
Yeah it's built in
Whatever the get up
Yeah it's built in

Wait till the rubout, wait for the purge
Wipe the last haole the fuck off our turf
Forget what you thought, forget what your heard
Wipe the last haole the fuck off our turf

Aloha, aloha, suit up
Luau, luau, luau, luau
Aloha, aloha, suit up
Luau, luau, luau, luau

Aloha, aloha, suit up
Luau, luau, luau, luau
Aloha, aloha
Suit up

Wait till the rubout, wait for the purge
Forget what you thought, forget what your heard
Wipe the last haole the fuck off our turf
Forget what you thought, forget what your heard

It's in the set-up
Yeah it's built in
Whatever the get up
Yeah it's built in

Kill all the tourists and we'll all sleep sound
Cash for their fillings and blow it in town, yeah we'll
We'll blow it on rifles, we'll blow it on drinks
Head in the corner, head in the sink

Aloha, aloha, suit up
Luau, luau, luau, luau
Aloha, aloha, suit up
Luau, luau, luau, luau

Aloha, aloha, suit up
Luau, luau, luau, luau
Aloha, aloha
Suit up
