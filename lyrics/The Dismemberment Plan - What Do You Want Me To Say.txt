I lost my membership card to the human race 
So don't forget the face 
Because I know that I do belong here 
Go down the checklist let's see: 
Feelings are good 
Dishonesty is bad 
And keeping it inside is worse still 
You want a problem well I guess we got one now 
I really don't know how 
There's injuns over every goddamn hill 
What do you want me to say? 
What do you want me to do? 
To let you know that I do mean it
What do you want me to say? 
What do you want me to do? 
To let you know that I do mean it
What do you want me to say, yeah? 
I see it coming from a million miles away 
What else can I say? 
The only way you know I love you 
And there's no eye-to-eye just Moses on the mount 
Or I'm in for the count 
You need your man above or below you 
I cannot cry at will but I do wish I could 
Cause it'd do you some good 
When every joke I make is treason 
There was a time when you could make me laugh at will 
And you can do it still 
But never is it for the right reasons, yeah
What do you want me to say? 
What do you want me to do? 
To let you know that I do mean it 
What do you want me to say? 
What do you want me to do? 
To let you know that I do mean it 
What do you want me to say, yeah?
