[Spoken] Eins, zwei, drei, alle!1

Ooooh You cannot reach me now
Ooooh No matter how you try
Goodbye cruel world it's over
Walk on by

Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come)
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come)

[Spoken] Will the Audience convene at one fifteen, outside Brixton town hall, where we will be going...1

Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms

Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors

Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers
And fire the ovens
Waiting for the queers and the coons
and the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again my friend
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins
Home again my friend
All you need to do is follow the worms.

[Spoken] The Worms will convene outside Brixton Town Hall. We'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road {?and then we'll cross at?} {Abbot's Road} and we'll be covering some distance, twelve minutes to three we'll be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge. Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge we're in Westminster {Borough } area. It's quite possible we may encounter some Jew boys and from now on {?we've got to be careful?} by the way we go. At eighteen after midday, {?we'll all be at Hyde Park! and there we'll continue?...}
[Chanting] Hammer, hammer...1
