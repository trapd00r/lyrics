I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
I had to put her 
Six feet under 
And I can still hear her complain 


I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
I knew I miss her 
So I had to keep her 
She's buried right in my back yard 


I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
She bitched so much 
She drove me nuts 
And now I'm happier this way 


I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
I used to love her, but I had to kill her 
I had to put her 
Six feet under 
And I can still hear her complain
