Break out your fucking swishes
Light up your fuckin' weed
I'd like to introduce you all to The Chronic III
It's D R period Dre motherfucka
Back to set the record straight for motherfuckers

I gotta be the number one supplier
I keep you higher than Richard Pryor
I been the dope man since '86 ('86)
From a nigga with a attitude to a nigga that's fucking rich
I'm feeling better than I've ever been
A lot stronger, plus I got a bet I win (bet I win)
I'm taking all bets, fuck it I'm all in
And when I'm finished with this business I will be number
One (one one)
Started out on the turn tables with little [?] tables turned
You can't imagine what my label earned
I gross more in a year than most niggas make in their whole career
I'm only here
Two (two two)
Make sure I shake up your rear view
And you niggas could not see me with a clear view
If I was you I'd probably hate me too
'Cause yeah you got a budget but you can't fit Dre in it, it's
Three (three three)
Album solo, that Aftermath logo, platinum plus 'cause I don't go gold
You know my stacks ain't got enough wall for all my plaques
Niggas actin' like I wasn't coming back
Four
More? I'm too in love with this shit, plus I came too far to quit
And it was in nine
Five
I got sick of niggas trippin' and shit, so I started building my label, sometime in 9 6
Six
Adjust the levels on my mic so it's loud and clear (testing)
This is something that I want the whole world to hear (world to hear)
Seven
I'm tired of niggas blaming sales on the industry
The music ain't shit, and personally it's offending me

Twelve steps to recovery

Fuckin' with the D R, find yourself an E R
Need CPR, do you know who we are?
Love cognac and cigars, so high I don't see y'all
On a whole 'nother level, that's why I couldn't be y'all
Eight
Straight summers they've been patiently waiting
And I'd like to thank you all for being patient
I'd like to shout out all the critics for hating
'Cause you've only been the fuel for my motivation
Nine
You cat's lives is limited
While I got black cards for all of my businesses
And there's
Ten
Million reasons why you can't fuck with Detox
And I'm the biggest influence in hip-hop
Eleven
I can't stop, look what I started
I get the most pay, because I work the hardest
Twelve
Should've been number one to me
It's hard work to you, but it's fun for me
