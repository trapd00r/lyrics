It's funny how we've seem to made it, funny how we can even walk up straight. 
Last night you sat home waiting, and I got home much too late, yeah to late. 
So what if we loose our minds, so what if it doesn't make much sense. 
At least we know we're lazy, at least we know how to play, we're so great. 

Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah. 
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years. 

And I'm afraid I need my baby, I'm afraid he doesn't know it yet. 
Someday I will tell him maybe, It's been like this since I don't know when, but it's great. 

Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah. 
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years. 
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah. 
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear. 

I was been told, you will never grow old, if you live your too fast. 
But I don't need to rest, I'm not old and tired, but I've been through fire and I've seen enough, 
and I might never be the same again, but have you seen my friends, they're just the same. 

Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah. 
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years. 
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah. 
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear
