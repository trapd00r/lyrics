Don't let your fear of a broken heart

(1) - Well as long as you're here
Can we sit together and work it out?
Well as long as you're here
Can we sit together and work it out?

Before you walk out the door
Give me one minute
To save this relationship
It's getting out of hand
You said some things
And I said some too
But to be without you
I can't understand
Don't let your fear of a broken heart
Don't let over rule our love
Can we just work it out?

I want you to be there for me
To dry my tears, to calm my fears
Have I made it clear
That I want you here with me
So whatever you want me to do
Say the word and baby for you
I'l' beg and plead on bended knee
Oh baby can't you see
Don't let your fear of a broken heart
Don't let over rule our love
Can we just work it out?

Don't let another day go by without us
Being together, but to be without you
I don't wanna say goodbye forever
Let's just work together

(Repeat 1 till end of song)
