Don't leave me alone
Make sure that i'm okay
I just got saved

It was early Monday morning picked up my bible and started to read a whole bunch of names
I have never ever heard these dudes before
So I put it down started watching T.V
Thinking this word is kind of hard for me
Then I picked it back up and I started to read
But I fell asleep
Whats wrong with me?

(Hook)
I just got saved last week so now what should I do?
Should I stay to myself and leave my old crew
How do I pray, and read
I really need you to disciple me
I'm new to all this I wasn't raised in the church
I don't know the basic things please show me how this works
All I know is that i've been forgiven please can you disciple me

It was Tuesday night
I knelt down to pray
Some of the things I said sounded kind of strange
Am I doing this right?
Can God even hear me?
Does he need to take care of more important things?

Does the word teach a man how he ought to pray?
If I tried to look that up it would take all day

Cos' I know within my heart there's a better way
Can you disciple me?

(Lecrae)
Ay look here young brah
I hear you young brah
Ay man you're wondering if God got ears for you huh
Well er, maybe not literally but biblically just stick with me
And get your bible out
Turn to Matthew chapter 6 with me
Look at verse 9
The beginning of a timeless prayer
Through verse 13 we stare
They call it the Lord's Prayer
But really it's for men
Cos' Jesus would never ask for the forgiveness of sin
It starts with our father
Acknoledge God whos holy
Anticipating his kingdom
We're living to bring him glory
To give us daily provision
Forgive us for our transgressions
And keep us from all temptation
Deliver us all from Satan
Yeah
Here's a sure way to pray take heed
And listen to his reply from the holy scriptures you read
And know that you serve a God who hears you so talk with him
But he's a God that steers you so walk with him
