Put me up, put me down, Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take / feel my heart and make me happy 2x

Here we go gettin' smooth to the groove
Watchin' lovely ladies as I swoo with as I move
Cause that's what they say But I can't prove
So turn it up again and watch me move to the groove

As we get close you whisper "coco"
I hold you in my arms and you say "jamboo"
Scream and shout, turn and say "columbo"
Now I gotta go so coco

Put me up, put me down, Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take / feel my heart and make me happy 2x
