Hey, grand hustler, homie
Yeah, it's the king, partner
You know I couldn't leave you
Without hollerin' at you one more time right, baby
Okay, man, go

Sexy boy, sexy boy, won't you be my
I'm in joy, chocolate kisses, don't you see my
I'm, boy, fixed on you tonight, boy
Only one I want for the rest of my life, boy

Am I coming on too strong?
Do I make you nervous?
No
Is this the first time that you heard this?
No

Baby, you got what I want
And I think I deserve it, won't hurt it
Promise I'll be worth it

So give me that, give me that, give me that good love
'Cause baby you're what I'm looking for
And every time you smile I want some more

So give me that, give me that, give me that good love
Now don't you tell me no
Just come here and give me that good love

Mercy me, mercy me, you makin' my
Temperature heat up, heat up, baby sky high
I don't mean to be rude but if you don't come on
I'ma come and get you

Am I coming on too strong?
No
Do I make you nervous?
No
Is this the first time that you heard this?
No

Baby, you got what I want
And I think I deserve it, won't hurt it
Promise I'll be worth it

So give me that, give me that, give me that good love
'Cause baby you're what I'm looking for
And every time you smile I want some more

So give me that, give me that, give me that good love
Now don't you tell me no
Just come here and give me that good love

So give me mine, give me mine, give me mine
Give me that, give me that good love
So give me mine, give me mine, give me mine
Give me that, give me that good love

Aye, where my ladies at? Throw you hands up
You see a sucka lookin' at you tell him, man up
So he bought a drink, tell him and what
That don't mean he got the right to keep you handcuffed

You got your hair done and your toes too
You lookin' good, girl, if ain't nobody told you
Even the hood girls with the gold tooth
And working girls who buy the purses and they own shoes

Sophisticated ladies went to school and graduated
Who don't be drinkin' everyday, but since they celebratin'
Hey, pop your bottles shawty and do your thing, ma
And let your hair down and let it hang, ma

To all the single moms raising babies on their own
Forget your baby daddy, baby, you don't need homes
Whether you got your real hair or a weave on
Whether you got some Frankie Bs or some Lees on

From the A-cups to the D-cups
To the Kiki's, Nikki's and Tameka's
Listen, not only will I hit it if you throw it to me
But I'ma beat it like you stole and you owe it to me

So give me that, give me that, give me that good love
'Cause baby you're what I'm looking for
And every time you smile I want some more

So give me that, give me that, give me that good love
Now don't you tell me no
Just come here and give me that good love
That good love

Ladies, this goes out to each and every last one of you, yeah
You know I got enough volume
But there can only be one queen
But you can still close your eyes and imagine, right?

A year and a day and counting
Grand hustler homie, it's the king
Alright, I can say that, Mary
