We are the Now Generation
We are the Generation Now
This is the Now Generation
This is the Generation Now
I want money

will.i.am
I want it-want it-want it
Fast internet
Stay connected in a jet
Wi-fi, podcast
Blasting out an SMS
Text me and I'll text you back
Check me on the iChat
I'm all about that http
You're a PC, I'm a Mac
I want it...

apl.de.ap
MySpace in your space
Facebook is that new place
Dip divin' socializin'
I'll be out in cyberspace
Google is my professor
Wikipedia checker

will.i.am
Checkin' my account
Loggin' in and loggin' out
Baby, I want it...
Now!

I want-I want-I want it now

Fergie
And I just can't wait

Taboo
I need it immediately

Fergie
And I just can't wait

Taboo

will.i.am
'Cause if time can't wait then
I sure can't wait
I ain't got no patience
No, I sure can't wait
Not today

I want money
I want cold hard cash
I'll take your dollar and your Euro
And go have a blast
So take your day and your credit
And stick it up your ass
And do it now!

I want it now!

will.i.am & Taboo & Fergie
Big money, give me mo' money
(Yeah I want it now!)
I need cas...man I need it bad

Quick in a hurry
Like your name is Flash

You make me wait?
And Imma whip yo' ass
(I want it now!)
I want it now baby!
(Now!)
I want it
(Now!)
I want it

will.i.am
Fast, rapido
Really quick, like torpedo
"Need for Speed" is my credo
You need to feed this negrito
Send it by your brother Bolt
Rapid like a thunderbolt
Activated, rock the boat
Just ask Barack who brought the hope to
Now!
It was a Now Generation
