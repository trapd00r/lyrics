It started at a bus stop
In the middle of nowhere
Sitting beside me
Was a man with no hair
From the look on his face
To the size of his toes
He'd come from a place
That nobody knows

Oh, maybe I'm hallucinating
Hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here 
Tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating
Hyperventilating
If you asked me now
Then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long
By a man from Milwaukee
He's talking too long
On his yellow walkie-talkie
He's talking to Mars
But I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him
Come get him someday

He says where he's from 
Is called Albertane
There they use more
Than ten percent of their brain
But you couldn't tell it
From they way they behave
They run around in underwear
And they never shave

Oh, maybe I'm hallucinating
Hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here 
Tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating
Hyperventilating
If you asked me now
Then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long
By a man from Milwaukee
He's talking too long
On his yellow walkie-talkie
He's talking to Mars
But I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him
Come get him someday

"This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird,
Baby Bird, come in. Come in, Baby Bird!
For the love of Pete come in!
This is Baby Bird, sorry, I was watching Court TV!
Do you copy? Do you copy?
Of course we copy, 24 hours a day, in color!"

You wouldn't believe me
If I told you the rest
The man sitting by me
Who was barely dressed
Flew off to Milwaukee
Or perhaps Albertane
And left me at the bus stop
Just barely insane

Oh, maybe I'm hallucinating
Hyperventilating
If you asked me now
Then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long
Thinkin' about Milwaukee
I've been talking too long
On my yellow walkie talkie
I'm talking to Mars
You might think I'm wacky
I know they'll come get me
Come get me someday
I know they'll come get me
And take me away
I know they'll come get me
Come get me someday
If not tomorrow
Then maybe today
