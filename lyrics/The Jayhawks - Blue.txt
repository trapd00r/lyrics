Where have all my friends gone 
They've all disappeared 
Turned around maybe one day 
You're all that was there 
Stood by unbelieving 
Stood by on my own 
Always thought I was someone 
Turned out I was wrong 

You brought me through 
And you made me feel 

Chorus: 
So Blue 
Why don't you stay behind 
So Blue 
Why don't you stop and look at what's going down 

Lived by an old woman 
She'd never sell me a lie 
It's hard to sing with someone 
Who won't sing with you 
Give all of my mercy 
Give all of my heart 
Never thought that I'd miss you 
That I'd miss you so much 

You brought me through 
And you made me feel 

(Chorus) 

All my life (Stand by) 
I've waited for (Stand by)
Someone I (Waiting round) 
Could show the door (Now, that I'm blue) 
But nothing seems to change (That I'm blue from now on)
You've come back into my arms

So Blue 
Why don't you stay behind 
So Blue 
Why don't you. Why don't you stay behind. 
So Blue 
Why don't you. Why don't you stay behind. 
So Blue 
Why don't you stop and look at what's going down
