You think you're in a bubblegum world
Playing in sandboxes too
I just thought to tell you girl
You're too old to think it's true

You should know by now girl (girl!)
You're too old to play games (yeh!)
It is getting to the point
You're going a little insane

You think you're Miss Muffet
And I'm the spider coming after you
All the time you're playing games
And all the time you're being so untrue

You should learn by now girl (yeh!)
That there's a time to stop (stop!)
Put all your toys away
And close up your candy shop

You should know by now girl (girl!)
You're too old to play games (yeh!)
It is getting to the point
You're going a little insane

You think you're in a bubblegum world
Playing in sandboxes too
I just like to tell you girl
You're too old to think it's true

You should know by now girl (girl!)
You're too old to play games (yeh!)
It is getting to the point
You're going a little insane
