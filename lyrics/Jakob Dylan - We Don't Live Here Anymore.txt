Left turn off a county road
The weathervane is to the north
In the shade of sycamore
Is the house where you were born
In the cotton fields below
Tall and mighty, brick and stone
Don't feel like it did before
'Cause we don't live here anymore

We don't live here
We don't live here
We don't live here anymore

That ain't country in their voice
They ain't no local boys
Landlord's daughter is at the door
Saying we don't live here anymore
We're off the script, we're off the lease
Can't catch any decent sleep
Let it flood, let it pour
We don't live here anymore

We don't live here
We don't live here
We don't live here anymore

Been working hard to the bone
Face down, nose to the grindstone
If God is working I wish he'd say so
Maybe he don't live here anymore
Glad I've got you here with me
Down in hell's half acre's infirmary
Hear that broom go across the floor
But we don't live here anymore

We don't live here
We don't live here
We don't live here anymore
