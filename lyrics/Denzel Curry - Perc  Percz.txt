Okay, all y'all niggas fuh as fuck
I'm ULT and I don't fuck with you if you ain't us, in me I trust
I turn these niggas into cosmic dust
I'm Loaded Lux with a loaded K, cock back I'll spray y'all bust
That playa shit, that Raider shit's been runnin' through my blood
These brand new niggas took my name and drug it through the mud
I get the hammer, I be the judge like Dredd
Police judge my dreads, fuck your favorite artists
Make sure they all dead
Shang Tsu, my son, broke it apart ran wit it
Weak shit, peep shit, stay dark, so tinted
Fuck around and get your dope fitted
New flows invented, shoot shit Cole Bennett
Rap game, don't get it
With these dumbass niggas, and they don't say shit
Sound like "Durr, durr, durr", you like "Oh, that's lit"
With yo' poof ass hips, I'ma fuck yo' bitch
I just popped two xans, nigga, fuck that shit!

On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst
Actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed
Tryna put me in a hearse
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst
Actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed
Tryna put me in a... yuh, yuh, yuh!

Maybe I should go to jail to get my name up
Then get out and show you how to fuck the game up
Keep my name out yo' mouth, keep yo' chain tucked
Keep yo' dame cuffed, I could make her famous
She's a plain slut that loves it in the anus
I should rap about some lean and my diamond cuts
Get suburban white kids to want to hang with us
It's your friendly neighborhood, I don't give a fuck
Getting straight I innovate, you ad-libs on that 808
Don't need a tattoo on my face cause Denzel is a different race
I don't even try to hate, I'm just saying what I ain't
People sleeping on me hard and I'm the hardest in the bank
Eight years in the game and I never rode a wave
I may be overlooked, but I'm never underpaid
And when I win a Grammy I'ma take it back to Dade
You signing to a label where they treat you like a slave

On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst
Actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed
Tryna put me in a hearse
On Tree, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On me, industry niggas the worst
Actin' like they from the dirt
On me, I do not fuck with the percs
I barely fuck with the Earth
On Tree, all of them niggas I birthed
Tryna put me in a...

Finish him Zel...
