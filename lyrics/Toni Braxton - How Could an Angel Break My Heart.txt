I heard he sang a lullaby
I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart

I heard her face was white as rain
(Your face is white as rain)
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
(Soft as a rose in May)
He keeps her picture in a frame
(I keep your picture)
And when he sleeps he calls her name...
(I only call out your name)
I wonder if she makes him smile
(She doesn't make me smile)
The way he used to smile at me
(I only smile at you)
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
(She doesn't make me laugh)
Because his laugh belongs to me
(My laugh belongs to you)

How could an angel break my heart
(You are my heart)
Why didn't he catch my falling star
(I'll catch your star)
I wish I didn't wish so hard
(Don't wish so hard)
Maybe I wish our love apart
(Love falls apart)
How could an angel break my heart...
(Your tender heart)

Whoa... oh... yeah

Oh my soul is dying, it's crying
I'm trying to understand
Please help me

How could an angel break my heart
(I never break your heart)
Why didn't he catch my falling star
(I catch your falling star)
I wish I didn't wish so hard
(You never wish too hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
(We're not apart)
How could an angel break my heart...
What...
Ooh...
