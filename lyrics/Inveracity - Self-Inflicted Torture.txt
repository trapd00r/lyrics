Out in the market for a better day
Self - inflicted torture, it's too late
There's no way back, you will rot way to fast
My eyes already foretell your future
In this life you created you live in disgust
Rape, theft and murder
As a lamb among the wolves they lewd the fuck out of you
Now you can cry in misfortune
By knowing it only gets worse every day
There's no escape since you entered a world of shit and decay
Forced in this life of sleaze, to earn your daily fix
For every whore there's a filthy pimp
Hand in the cash or you 'll have your throat slashed
I rape your body and soul
I 'll be there to watch
Your fall in the depths of impurity
This situation has gone out of hand
Forced prostitution - you 'll deal with it
My eyes already foretell your future in this life you created
Standing on your knees and sucking
Anyone's cum dripping from your face
This is not some kind of job for the weak
