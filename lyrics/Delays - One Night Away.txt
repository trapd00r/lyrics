There's nothing in the morning,
Just flowers and a feeling
That yesterday was 
Stalling for time
To let the scene in

But you know how everything grows
And you know 
The feeling is love
But you're one night away
You're one night away

The snow has 
Started falling and
Covered our graffiti
I wander through the city and
Find we're 
Stealing evening

But you know how everything grows
And you know the feeling is love
But 
You're one night away
You're one night away

The feeling is Love...
