 If I was a ballplayer, then I would dunk on ya faster 

 But since I'm a trackslayer, I fuck with Funkmaster 

 Premier lace the beat, so it can bump faster 

 Gurizzi, on Volume Thrizi, I gets busy 

 Since the days of the Quarters, Union Square, and the Castle 

 Been known to hold my own, if you give me a hassle 

 Rassle with this MC here, on the mic 

 Niggaz know they ain't prepared for the fight 

 Talk about your skills all day, I'm still bored 

 You disobeyed the laws, got no cause to kill for 

 You build your rep, off the next man's style 

 Played the role, and stole the page out the next man's file 

 You can't test, one of the best, in this art form 

 Ain't toleratin blatant disrespect for this art form 

 Whether or not I make a track to keep the charts warm 

 I come to do a show, pros and hoes, know it's on 

 From BK to Uptown, and all around 

 See how easy, they all fall down 

 While suckers go off, and show off, I throw your whole bluff off 

 That semi old school rapper that you grown up off 

 Come off the top rope, just like the Junkyard Dog 

 to the mat, with my ill kid form of rap 

 Take that, what I just spat, and then store that 

 Just like on a Pentium with CD-rom and all that 

 Fly shit, that we create, just like that 

 We great like that, straight like that

 Funkmaster Flex 

 Now till forever baby
