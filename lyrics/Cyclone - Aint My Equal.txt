U wanna talk shit? U wanna run ya mouth?
U want some gangstas front yo motherfucking house?
We'll set this bitch off, yeah set this bitch off
We'll set this bitch off, set this bitch off
They call me Bad Azz, and I'll punish you
You ain't my equal, we ain't people and I ain't one of you
Since '98 I grabbed my plate up off the lunch table
I told mama I'm thugging outside we don't need cable
Now I'm the nipples on the titty, the motor called a "Hemi"
I'm the v-12 in that 760, you nigga's bitches
We real niggas with g-codes
We love to go in beast mode
We thugging, we all got bread so if we fall we the crutches
We the dodo in the dutchess
I'm the photo in the camera
I'm the pistol when it snap ya'
I got the sickest beemer, I got the sickest magnum, I got the sickest charger
Ya'll's 30 mines 40
I told ya nigga's let me get me, fo you get stretched in the street
This the day that u gonna be deceased fa playing with a beast
I told Turk take off my collar
I'm finna take it there
You niggas ain't play at my projects, ya'll played at the fair
Trill Entertainment, that's my thugs there
That's love there
D.A. don't search my house cause ain't no motherfucking drugs there
We smart with this shit, we got retarded with this shit
Duce-Duce up in my shoe, I set if off up in this bitch nigga

[Chorus:]
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My click all dogs bitch don't make us set it off [x2]
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
You jumping like a frog we'll put you on that wall
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My click all dogs bitch don't make us set it off

Not the lyrics to "SET IT OFF"? Please report that below.
Man I be thugging, I be fresh, I be super clean
With Gucci shades wit some j's you ain't never seen
The race car jacket with bout 80 fucking patches, with the car to match it
Tony Stewart, it's a classic
Ya'll penny pinching nigga, we spending on ya'll niggas
Call savage from the back, come pour some Henny on these niggas, man
You don't wanna fuck wit me
I learned from the streets, yeah
I roll wit my heat, yeah
Never turn on my peeps cause I'm gotta
Came out my mama a hustla
Been through the rain and the pain, now I'm a dirty motherfucker
I'll hurt a motherfucker, set it off in this bitch
Ya'll niggas coughing in this bitch, we flossing in this bitch
And I walk real well, fuck going to jail
Come home and set it off and get ya mail, nigga
I got a mind full of evil thoughts
So don't get ya people caught round my people house
Cause believe me I'm gone set it off bitch

Do you know what album had this song, can you report to us below?

[Chorus]

If you can not find the lyrics you want, You may want to request them.
Oh you bucked up and fucked up and you ain't got no mind
Don't even respect ya elders no you ain't respecting mine
But I'm gone hit you wit that nine, put some sense in ya nigga
Shoulda put something on ya ass when u was a lil nigga
Now that u wanna play wit the real niggas
well set it off
Bitch u scared to let it off, plus ya daddy wasn't no dog
Ya mama had more heart than ya daddy bitch ass
U ain't gone set nothing off, that's who made u soft
Bitch u wanna come in that south, where it get dumb in that drought
Where nigga's wild out like O-dog and run in yo house
And run in yo mouth, it's crucial
Watch what u say bout Boosie
Cause Boosie to oozie's
It's crucial
Ain't never had shit but I'll fuck a bad bitch
Quicker that u can count to 6, 1-2-3-4-5-6 she hit
I don't play, I lay laws, u my size I break jaws
I get disrespected at all, I set it off nigga

I set it off in this motherfucker, Don't make me let it off in this motherfucker
And you gone respect a dog up in this motherfucker
Cause I'll set it off
[x2]
