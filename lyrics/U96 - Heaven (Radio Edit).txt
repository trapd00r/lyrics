Feels like in heaven... 
Feels like in heaven... 
Call it love, call it sin 
It's the state I'm in 
Feels like in heaven 

I am blessed and obsessed 
Mysterious angel 
Feels like in heaven 

Heaven... 
Wonder... 
Angel... 
Danger... 

Let's taste it and waste it 
Forbidden fruit 
Feels like in heaven 

To measure the pleasure 
To melt in emotions 
Feels like in heaven 

Heaven... 

Feels like in heaven... 

Angel... 
Danger... 

Call it love 
Feels like in heaven 
Call it sin 
Heaven... 
Feels like in heaven 

Two lovers, two sinners 
A poison kiss 
Feels like in heaven 

Baby stay what you are 
Strong propaganda 
Feels like in heaven 

Heaven...
Heaven...
