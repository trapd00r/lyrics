Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me

If I'm gonna rob, I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin for somethin it's probably a fight
If I'm goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head 
(Man: better be right)

Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend

(Man: many many men)
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep spot that we can go to chill

(Man: hoes)
Only reason I come around is for the 
(Man: hoes)

{Man: hoes)
Hit em off with that dark brown, 
{Man: you know?)

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me, c'mon!)
Ain't no other cats got love for me
