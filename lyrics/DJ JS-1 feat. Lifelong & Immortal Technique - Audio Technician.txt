(Feat. Immortal Technique, L.I.F.E. Long)

JS-1, Technique, L.I.F.E. Long, Y'all
I only role with two masta turntablists
Goose with ya record making wax and needles kiss
Not these amateurs only relying on playlists
My man JS-1 wanna make vitals say ouch, from the cuts and scratch
Even Technique can vouch, why your DJ's just learning to speak with hands
Most these jockies ain't really moving no jams
Just sittin' back and under the table payola
Weak mixtapes with MC's writing tracks with crayola
My peeps be fatal freakers spitting crate exclusives
Jugglin wax got ears vibing off the new shit
All wannabe DJ's got me sleep during they mix
I feel like slicing an axe and Catastra fingertips
Now all you gotta do is take note
And watch real turntable technicians show y'all the ropes
Respect due to DJ's who represent every day all day
Let this shit here play

This for the DJ's who play the real Hip-Hop
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
Turntablers... Audio Technician
JS on the wheels of steel
Can, can break a beat, cut, scratch and transform
(Scratches: JS-1)
Y'all original... I don't need MTV I can smash your clique like 1, 2, 3

Yo I conduct guerilla warfare throughout the pj's
On the government control by wack DJ's
Plan water down commercial cause a payola
Taking orders from the label on the 2-way motorolas
Spit solar rays on DJ's who think they raw
Right before I break your fingers off on a car door
And I'm give your girl a C-section with a chainsaw
And graffiti my name with the blood stains on the floor
Hardcore on a fake turntablist brotha, you wack niggas blend
Like yellow and purple colors, motherfucker nobody wanna hire a decoy
You couldn't spin in the club as a fuckin' B-boy
Cause juvenile cats don't get the big picture, gimme dat vet stacks
And go back to your Fisher Price mixa
I'm about to hit ya like da pentagon after I take off
Yo JS-1 cut this motherfuckas face off

(Scratches: JS-1)
Train train train and chuck chuck chuck
(Continues scratching)
Cut cut cut, cut like a guillotine
(Continues scratching)
Any questions?

This for the DJ's who play the real Hip-Hop
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
Turntablers... Audio Technician
JS on the wheels of steel
Can, can break a beat, cut, scratch and transform
(Scratches: JS-1)
Y'all original... I don't need MTV I can smash your clique like 1, 2, 3
