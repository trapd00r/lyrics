I've been looking for you, baby
Anywhere that I can find
And I was searching for your sweet name
Cause you never left my mind
I've been on the Altavista
I went twice on the Yahoo
And everywhere I go,
there is always a clue,
always something about you that may help me get my hands on you

like
It's your birthday tomorrow
but you're not getting anything you know
It's your birthday tomorrow
but I'm not supposed to know
Not supposed to know

Hacked into the school computer
changed all of your D's to A's
Broke into the dentist's office
Know you never needed braces
Know you moved from another small town
Know you're never going away
Cause soon you'll fall in love
The fortune teller said
And I know who will be the one to make your bed

And it's your birthday tomorrow
but you're not getting anything you know
It's your birthday tomorrow
but I'm not supposed to know
Not supposed to know

I was talking to your best friend
I checked out you high school yearbook
I was driving round you Mum's house
she makes great coffee, you know
I spoke to your former girlfriend
so now, I know what I've got to expect
And yesterday, you passed my by
I swear, I nearly said Hi
I could have died
I swear to God I started crying
