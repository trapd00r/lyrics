They told me what you'd do
If I ever stayed with you
They told me that you'd laugh
While I cry

They told me what you'd say
That you'd turn and walk away
And find another place to play
While I cry

Now I think back on those times
I didn't read between the lines
How all the things that you said
Never seemed to match the things you did

What you do
Thoughts keep turning round in my mind
Now I see reason and rhyme
Time spent with you has brought me something
And I've lost nothing if you are that kind

They told me what you'd do
If I ever stayed with you
And sure enough
It all came true
