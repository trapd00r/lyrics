My life's in jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be
I ain't been home since Friday night and now my wife
Is comin' after me

Give me police protection
Gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard, a black belt judo expert
With a machine gun

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me, won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman and that's enough
To send her half insane

Gonna buy a fast car
Put on my lead boots and take a long, long drive
I may end up spendin' all my money
But I'll still be alive

All I did was have a bit too much to drink
And I picked the wrong precinct
Got picked up by the law
And now I ain't got time to think

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman and that's enough
To send her half insane

Gonna buy a fast car
Put on my lead boots and take a long long drive
I may end up spendin' all my money
But I'll still be alive

And I'm oh so tired of running
Gonna lay down on the floor
I gotta rest some time
So I can get to run some more, yeah

She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
