A letter to burn
A letter to send
And to return

Secrets arise
Secrets live for a while
Maybe long to die

Love doesn’t know
When to stay away
Love doesn’t choose among
Nights and days
Love simply stands in the way

A travel to make
A travel to break
And to go back

Histories are made
Remembered and saved
But they will fade

Love doesn’t know
When not to appear
Love doesn’t excuse itself anywhere
Love is just suddenly here

Love doesn’t know
When it’s not allowed
Love doesn’t understand
To ever be shut out

Love doesn’t know
Of what manners would say
Love just gets sick if it’s sent away

Love just gets in the way
