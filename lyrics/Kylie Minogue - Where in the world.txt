There'll never be
Another moment like this
The touch of your hand
Maybe this is our final kiss
And I don't know why
You're leaving tonight
It's so hard to believe
Am I dreaming or is this goodbye?

Where in the world will I be without you
If you are leaving?
Where is the love that was meant to be true
And we believed in?
Now you're saying that you're leaving me
Taking your heart setting me free
Don't know where in the world I will be
If you are leaving

I'll never know
As long as I live
Feelings so deep in my heart
From a love such as this
So don't take away
The light from my day
The sun and the moon would be mine
If only you'd stay

Where in the world will I be without you
If you are leaving?
Where is the love that was meant to be true
And we believed in?
Now you're saying that you're leaving me
Taking your heart setting me free
Don't know where in the world I will be
If you are leaving
