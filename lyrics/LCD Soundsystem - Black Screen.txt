You couldn't make our wedding day, too sick to travel
You fell between a friend and a father

I owe you dinner, man, I owe you something
You talked to me like I was inside

We were just waking up
For a hard interrupt

I meant to get to you on returning
Things sneak up on me like a landslide comes

Been saving email trails, kept together
I read them back sometimes to remember

The time I wrote to you from the island
Your quick replies made me high

But I had fear in the room
So I stopped turning up

My hands kept pushing down in my pockets
I'm bad with people things, but I should have tried more

Been watching images from the station
Earth One from satellites, all streaming

Feels slow at seventeen-thousand miles an hour
You could be anywhere on the black screen

On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen

You could be anywhere on the black screen
