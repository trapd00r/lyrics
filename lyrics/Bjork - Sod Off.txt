I know I've been tolerant 'til now,
But here comes a warning,
There's a very clear line that i'm drawing,
And if you cross it.

Sod off
Sod off

If you think I'll let you pull me down to
Your third-class communication,
And bulldoze over all my sensitivities
You've read me all wrong.

Sod off
Sod off
Sod off
Sod off

Things so far,
Have been too perfect
This is the premiere
But, oh, how many dress rehearsals
I've been through

Darling this is far too pure and perfect 
I let you corrupt it.

Sod off!
I wont let you ruin this.
Sod off.

Sod off.
Sod off.
Sod off.
Sod off.
