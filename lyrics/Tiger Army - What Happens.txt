You're walking in the night - you walk alone
The shadows whisper your name...
A stranger beckons you, like none you've seen
You can't ignore his request as he whispers, "Come to me..."

I want to show you what happens when we die...
You take a chance and then it's too late when you realize
I want to show you what happens when
I want to show you what's happening
I want to show you what happens when we die

Time has come to see beyond now - reach out take my hand
Something inside beckons you...
A shiver takes you - delicious thrill
Tonight's our destiny, so come and let it be fulfilled
