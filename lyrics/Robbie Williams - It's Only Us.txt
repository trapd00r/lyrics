And they want us to grow up
But we don't want to get a job
We all need a decent rock
Where it's all kicking off

Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's all-a-alright
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's all-a-alright, it's only us

We're just after cheaper thrills
Since the price went up on pills
From Stoke-on-Trent to Beverly Hills
You know it's all kicking off

Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's all-a-alright
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's all-a-alright, it's only us
It's only us
Rock me, Amadeus!

Well, it's all kicking off
Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's all-a-alright
You don't need to cause a fuss
Baby, it's alright
Baby, it's all-a-alright, it's only us
It's only us

(You don't need to cause a fuss)
(Baby, it's alright)
It's only us
