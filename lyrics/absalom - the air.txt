Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (air)
Ooh..

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air
Oh..

I'm here alone
Didn't want to leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

But how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[CHORUS:]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
Ohh..
No air, air
No..
No air, air
Oh..
No air, air

I walked, I ran
I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down
For real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how
But I don't even care

So how do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe

[CHORUS:]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
Ohh..
No air, air
Ohh..
No air, air
No, oh..
No air, air
No more

It's no air, no air
Ohh..

[CHORUS 2x:]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gon' be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air

No air, air
Ohh..
No air, air
Ohh..
No air, air
No air, ohh
No air
