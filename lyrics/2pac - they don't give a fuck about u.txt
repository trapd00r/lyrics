Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
And just looked at the whole situation
'Cause once you look at it you know
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us

If I chose to die, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
And when I start to rise, a hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

Some say niggaz is hard headed, 'cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang wit' this thuggish shit
I see you trying to hide, hoping that nobody don't notice
You must always remember you still a member of the hopeless

See ya black like me, so you snap like me
When these devils try to plot, trap our young black seeds
Look it, cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models, our father figures is bases

Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I flee computer chips, I gotta deal wit' brothas flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin', only black blood drippin'

We can change, whatcha now say?
I'm watchin' niggaz work their lives out without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places wit' the bustas on top
I'm bustin' shots make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us

And if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
When I start to rise, a hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

If I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise, a hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did, 'cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons, dawg, I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you

Or them five mouths you forced to feed, not including yourself
All you want is what they perceiving as greed
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck 'em
I was on paper, thinking they don't give a fuck about us

I'm seeing it clearer, hating the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, the aftermath is y'alls

I told ya last album, we need help, 'cause we dying
Give us a chance, help us advance, 'cause we trying
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us

And if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise, a hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

If I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise, a hero in they children's eyes
Nobody gives a fuck about us

Now all my homies got love for me, down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply, now that's love shit
Nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut

What the fuck done went wrong, how long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song, ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em? Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck, I don't feel what I'm saying?

Now thug niggaz die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times, we busted like bubbles with the police
This nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to

I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man, I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and working
I see no reason, so I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck?

You tell me my world is in peace but nigga you're lying
'Cause half of my niggas, long gone, buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying
And that it's awful to wake up to another day
Shit ain't change that all fool

I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down, backwards head twisted
While I'm layin, in the coffin
The shit comes around so often, so tell me something
Before I take it out on the world and get to dumpin'

Nigga, I been so through pain go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin', well, since you don't give a fuck
I be frontin' and I'ma drink my Hennessey like it ain't nothin'

Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
While I'm kickin' rhymes, getting to the children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us

They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us

Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
While I'm kickin' rhymes, getting to the children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us

They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
