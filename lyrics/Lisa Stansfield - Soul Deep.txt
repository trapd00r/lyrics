Soul deep is the love I'm feeling inside
I always rise above whenever I try
Soul deep is the love I feel for myself
Only I can make me feel this way
And nobody else

See it this way when I feel down and feel dismayed
The only option is to come to me come what may
I can ask whoever's there whoever cares
But it's up to me at the end of the day

I'll always try to see it my way
I'll always see it my way

Soul deep is the love I'm feeling inside
I always rise above whenever I try
Soul deep is the love I feel for myself
Only I can make me feel this way
And nobody else

When I'm blue it's always me who pulls me through
Nobody else can see myself the way I do
I'm sticking to me baby
'Cause I'm the one who cares the most about myself
At the end of the day

I'll always try to see it my way
I'll always see it my way

Soul deep is the love I'm feeling inside
I always rise above whenever I try
Soul deep is the love I feel for myself
Only I can make me feel this way
And nobody else

Soul deep is the love I'm feeling inside
I always rise above whenever I try
Soul deep is the love I feel for myself
Only I can make me feel this way
And nobody else

I'll always try to see it my way
I'll always see it my way

Soul deep is the love I'm feeling inside
I always rise above whenever I try
Soul deep is the love I feel for myself
Only I can make me feel this way
And nobody else
