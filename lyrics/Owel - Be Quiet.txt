[Verse 1]
When the words have finally run out
I shall place these hands upon this mouth
For talking made a distant life
So I'd rather be quiet
I'd rather be quiet

(Quiet)

[Verse 2]
Even if it isn't torture
I would rather drown than be drowning
And if it isn't honest, then it isn't worth the breath
I'll hold it instead
I'll hold it instead

[Chorus]
I'll spend the next year in bed
If I can't get my way

(Stay)

[Breakdown]
They might say I've given in
But I've given up and there's a difference
And when the words I lost are found
I'll move these hands away and speak them out

[Chorus]
I'll spend the next year in bed
If I can't get my way out
