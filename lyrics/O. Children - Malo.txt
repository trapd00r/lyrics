Malo
She's in my mind
When I'm sleeping
The nights are so sure
I wake up screaming

The night be so good
End up sleeping
Malo

Malo!
Malo!

Malo!
This Sacrafice
Necessary...
My soul can't survive
It's so weary
If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo
If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo

If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo
If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo

In an instance sacrifice
Leaves defences in my mind
I was virile, full of hope
So I travelled on my own

Full of sickness
I begged for help
I have realised my wrongs
If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo

If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo

If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo

If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever, malo

If I lose you tonight
I lose you forever
