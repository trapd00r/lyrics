Endless space I do see
Someone there calls to me
Look through our window
The sky below
Giggles with laughter
At a funny side show
It's been on ten thousand years
Will it go on or finally die?

Save your right to a home
We can't help you alone
Your people are starving
And dying of thirst
Why the importance of who gets there first?
Save your life before it's gone
Your present course ends violently
