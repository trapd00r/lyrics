Baby, don't fight it
I'm comin' baby

Do you know how long a tree lives
Or the reason it grows?
You may ask me all these questions
But darling, no one knows

It should be clear, I really love you
Don't ask me why, I just do
Do you ask the Lord who loves you
Why He paints the sky clear blue?

It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
We were meant, we were meant to stay together
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it

Oh, don't ask me how long I'll love you
When you're gone, my heart aches
I'll never, never leave you
Girl, all my life, for you I'd wait 'cause it's the way

It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
We were meant, we were meant to stay together
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it

Don't fight it, baby
I'm coming, girl

It should be clear, I really love you
Don't ask me why, I just do 'cause it's the way
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
Like the stars and the sky and the beautiful heaven

It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
We were meant, we were meant to stay together

Why does a flower grow?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
Why does the river flow?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it

We were meant, we were meant
We were meant, we were meant to stay together

Why does it rain?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
Why do I feel this way?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
