Strophe I:

While a force of nature is falling down to earth.
Seas of tears and sadness, no one knows my worth.

No reason for existence, to be or not to be...
It's just a scene of madness, all the signs I was to blind to see.

Strophe II:

Back on wasted places, the end of time's been reached
covered human faces, I can't get no sleep.

Like a force of nature pain is flooding me
My scene of perdition, no reply to what it means to be.
