Won't you call my private number
We can go away for the summer

We can drive around with the top down
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to

But I hear that you wanna ditch me
But you know I'm not such a bad seed

(We can drive around)
We can drive around with the top down
(With the way fat sound)
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to

Won't you come on down to the freak show
You can sit and watch as my hair grows

(We can drive around)
We can drive around with the top down
(With the way fat sound)
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to 

Won't you call my private number
We can go away for the summer

(We can drive around)
We can drive around with the top down
(With the way fat sound)
Stereo turned up loud with a fat sound
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
'Cause I'm yours to keep if you want to
Yeah
