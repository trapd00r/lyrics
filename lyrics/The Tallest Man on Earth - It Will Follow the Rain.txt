Have you ever seen the far side
Of a mountain swallow the sky
As you travel through the valley
And as your speedin still far behind
Through the valley where lovers climb

Have you ever seen the locust
Lean his wings right after a plague
Like ascendin of a dark cloud
In the sunlight to end the day
To kill the sunlight, to end the day

Yes it will follow the rain

Have you ever seen the quiet
Indecision of a man
When he's standing by the fire
With an eager friend in his hand
Will he ever quite understand

That it will follow the rain
I said oh my friend
It will follow the rain

Have you ever seen your baby
Getting caught by the lonesome wind
And the whistling round the corners
Telling you they have let her in
Separation can now begin

Yes, it will follow now the rain.
I said oh my friend.
It will follow the rain
I said oh my friend
It will follow the rain

Have you ever seen the far side
Of a mountain swallow the sky,
As you travel through the valley
As you're speeding still far behind

Through the valley where lovers climb
Where the children will blink and sigh
They have caught a lightning strike
In the jar just to watch it die
In the valley where lovers climb
Yes it will follow the rain

I said oh my friend
It will follow the rain
