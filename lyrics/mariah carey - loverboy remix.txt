A lover, a loverboy

Maybe it's the glitter on her breast
Or the gloss on her lips?
Hickeys on the chest
Or the toss of the hips?
I'm lost in the mix
So I floss in the (sea) Turning out the hits
So I'm exhausted as shit

Now baby it's the mo' paper, dough chaser
Now get it right, would ya heartbreaker?
I keep it tight but I'm no faker
You can laugh now but you'll cry later

I think I like you in ya freak clothes
Freak thongs at my specialized peep shows
And then I'll make ya touch your knees to your elbows
Toes curl from Beat Street to Melrose, the whole world

It's cool
Cause See I like it when we smoked out, choked out
Who's a freak bitch? (No doubt)
You kind of got me like a fiend
When you call out
Now get your boys for my girls
We can roll out
Roll, roll out

I got myself a lover
Who loves what I like
When he invites me over

And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we going next
To leave on time

(Repeat * in background)
He's all mine
And his loving makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy


Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (Baby all night long)

Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long]

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
'Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we going next to
Leave it on time

(Repeat * in background)
I get weak
When his candys taste so sweet
He caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Repeat **

Poor little, kind of innocent
A vision of love
You adore me, even though my image is thug

What I see in you is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you
Up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl

Me your loverboy
But when we home alone

Can't avoid

The way I throw that, cat
Pop back, drop
Stop, watch, Brat-tat
Get ya more rock, harder
All of the things that you wanna do to me
You oughtta
We can get obscene
My parina and your ding-a-ling
Mingle bother me not



Uh huh uh huh baby
Feel me, when I pump, pu-pump lady
Behind me we can be close like family
You're so sweet you taste like all types of candy
From Starburst to jellybeans

Banana split my dairy queen
Butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my
Loverboy in they dreams
Yeah all my ladies
Let me hear you scream

Hate on me as much as you want to
You can't do what the fuck I do
Bitches be emulating me daily
Hate on me as much as you want to
You can't be who the fuck I be
Bitches be imitating me lately

Repeat **
(Fade out)
