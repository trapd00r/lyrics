When the light fades on a long bad day, I sometimes weaken. Then I turn
to see you've been waiting for me, I know I'm not beaten. 'Cause you
lift me up, you do.
Coming home sometimes I catch the headlines. It's been raining since
Saturday night. And the trains run late, I'm stuck at Notting Hill
Gate. But you'll make it alright. 'Cause you lift me up (you make it
alright), you do.
Such a little thing, our love won't make the world alright, but love
makes sense of life and that's enough, at least tonight.
So late at night maybe, when you call me baby, the day will just fall
away. 'Cause you lift me up, you do.
