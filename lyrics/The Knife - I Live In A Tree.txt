Oh, the shark, Babe,
Has such teeth, Dear,
And he shows those
Pearly whites.
Just a jack-knife 
Has old Mack Heath, Babe,
And he keeps it...mmmmmm,yeah outta sight 1,2,3,4.
You know, when that shark bites
With its teeth, Babe,
Scarlet billows start to spread.
Fancy gloves, oh,
Wears old Mack Heath, Babe,
So there's never - uh !
Never a trace of red.
Now, on the sidewalk,
Ooh, sunny mornin', uh-huh,
Lies a body
Just oozin' life. Eek!
And someone's sneakin'
'Round the corner!
Could that someone
Be Mack the Knife?
Ah, there's a tugboat
Down by the river, don't you know,
Where a cement bag's
Just a-droopin' on down.
Oh, that cement is just...
It's there for the weight, Dear.
Five'll get you ten,five'll get ya ten (fast)
Old Mackie's back in town!
Now'd you hear 'bout Louie Miller?
He disappeared, Babe,
After drawin' out
All his hard-earned cash.
And now Mack Heath spends
Just like a sailor.
Could it be our boyâ€™s
Done something rash?
Now, Jenny Diver, oh, oh yeah!
Sookie Taudry!
Oh, Miss Lottie Linia,
And Ol' Lucy Brown.
Oh, the line forms on the right, Babe,
Now that Mackie's back in town.
Now, Jenny Diver, oh, oh yeah!
Sookie Taudry!
Oh, Miss Lottie Linia,
And Ol' Lucy Brown.
Oh, the line forms on the right, Babe,
Now that Mackie's back in town.

Look out! Ol' Mackie's back!
