Well, Old Dan Tucker, was a fine old man,
Washed his face in a frying pan
Combed his hair with a wagon wheel
And died with a toothache in his heel

Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper.
Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper.

Old Dan Tucker, he'd come to town
Riding a billy goat, leading a hound
The hound dog barked, the billy goat jumped
Landed 'Ol Tucker on a stump!

Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper
Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper

Now Old Dan Tucker got drunk and fell
In the fire and kicked up holy hell
A red-hot coal fell in his shoe
And oh my Lord the ashes flew

Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper
Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper

Now old Dan Tucker has come to town
Swinging them ladies all around
First to the right and then to the left
Then to the gal that he loves best

Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper
Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper

Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper
Get out the way! Old Dan Tucker,
You're too late to get your supper
