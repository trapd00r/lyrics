I smoke this niggas like they
(Tupac, Tupac)
I smoke this niggas like they
(Tupac, Tupac, Tupac come here and rock)

I'm smokin' these niggas like they endo
Breakin' 'em like they windows
And still they riff till they get a whiff of the shit that I kick
And if they ever had a notion to stop me
Shoot ya best shot and get dropped wit ya posse

(Static, static, Tupac, Tupac)
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
(Tupac go ahead and rock)
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

(Static, Tupac, Tupac)
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
(Tupac go ahead and rock)

Nigga, I got the motz I'm takin' 'em out a lot, I got
More than you can hock I'm rockin' the spot
So now they jock loc'em and get dropped
Tupac ain't tryin' to hear it

I'm swingin' at your knot I'm swingin' at your knot so hot
Static is the last thing ya need when ya see me
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me
Nigga I'm a whole posse rolled into one shot

Takin' all ya got, as your girl gets hot
And rocks the spot

(Static, static, Tupac, Tupac)
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
(Tupac go ahead and rock)
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

(Static, Tupac, Tupac)
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
(Static, Tupac, Tupac)
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

Bringin' the funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Bringin' the funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Bringin' the funky flavor with the gift that only God gave

Point me to my grave, I'd rather die than be a slave
Slaves come as dope dealers
Some come as addicts
Some try to run while the others call static

Static, static, Tupac go ahead and Tupac go ahead and
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

Static, Tupac go ahead and Tupac go ahead and
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

Static, Tupac, Tupac
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Static, Tupac, Tupac
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

Static, Tupac, Tupac
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

Static, Tupac, Tupac
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

Static, Tupac, Tupac
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Static is the last thing you need when you see me

Static, Tupac, Tupac
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
