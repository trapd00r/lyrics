I've seen you twice
In a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to be
For every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game
Does it mean anything to you
What's the name of the game
Can you feel it the way I do

Tell me please
Cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child
Beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you
Would you let me down
Would you laugh at me
If I said I cared for you
Could you feel the same way too
I wanna know

The name of the game
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you
(Doesn't mean any pivotal choice
But it means a lot)
What's the name of the game
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do

Tell me please
Cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child
Beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you
Would you let me down
Would you laugh at me
If I said I cared for you
Would you feel the same way too
I wanna know
Oh yes I wanna know

The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you
(But I think I can see in your face
That it means a lot)
What's the name of the game
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do
(Doesn't mean any pivotal choice
But it means a lot)
What's the name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you
(But I think I can see in your face
That it means a lot)
What's the name of the game
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)...
