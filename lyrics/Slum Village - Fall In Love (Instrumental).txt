One-two one-two

To fall in love,
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do.

Lady's lovin' my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch wreck
I'm the motherfucker gripping the mic like it's a joke
Niggas fall in love with the music like it's a ho'
Put down your mic you lost your whole goal
You take it too seriously like it's a gamble
Fuck this rap shit I listen to classical
In the studio loop as usual
Lovin' my lyrical
Fuck bitches that you would know
I'm out of this cause you wanna be below
Y'all niggas in love with the S
Y'all niggas in love with the S

(T3)
Yeah, jay-dee man I see sometimes,
I sit and wonder when I think about these written rhymes
How'd I get to the point constantly taking all my time?
Time I could have been spending gettin' cash, gettin' mine
Hoping one day it comes around
One day when I'm the nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the fuck out the ghetto, 'cause I'm tired of crime
But it's a crime that I feel this fucking waste of time
But sometimes I feel like this shit here is a waste of time, yours and mine
To these niggas out here trying to rhyme
Your reason for a better should have been genuine
I do it because it gives me a sort of peace-of-mind
And for the love

Don't sell yourself

Yo, one-two
Word up, ah one-two, SV, word up, word up, all right.

(T3)
Uh, uh, uh and to my nigga Jay-Dee uh, uh my nigga T-3 uh, oh
That nigga Baatin uh, uh, that's my crew,
Yo, uh, oh this going out to my nigga Bust-a,
And all my other motherfu-cka,
What up to all you trying to bust, us.
Trying to get down with us, 'cause we know you just mad as hell,
Yo I'll give 'em the mic, eh! So niggas don't know that I am,
T-3 on the mic,
I do what I do what I like, to get down right tonight.
(Cause?) 'Cause I get down tonight, yo
Niggas try and put up a fight, wit us, yo all right.

Some freestyle shit
