Why the spear in your eyes 
When I try to see you
Don't you know it's beyond me 
Just to have you here 
Some people would say 
Im only dreaming 
So how come I feel you 
Just about everywhere

So excuse me if I say that I could die
for this world you showing me now

Why your doubt in your voice
When I try to tell you
Cant you see me standing 
Right beside you 
Some people would say 
That it could have been magic
But I wont forget the magic 
Like I dont forget that day

So excuse me if I say that I could die for this world
you showing me now
So excuse me if I say that I could die for this world
you showing me now
