You say what you say
And you pray that one day
You'll be seen between the shadows
Now that's a waist of your pain
Living your life like a saint
When it don't...no
It don't even matter
Even saints make their mistakes
Letting their dreams fall and break
All it feels like
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
Now I want you to see
How good life can be
You can turn around
And better your life
With the good times found

People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
People will always take the long way around
People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
People will always take the long way around

I'm not afraid of pride
When it's for the right side
Don't betray what I believe in
Stand where you want to stand
And I'll believe when I can
'Cause I'm telling you now
I been where you're living in

People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
People will always take the long way around
People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
People will always take the long way around

Will tomorrow keep it's promise
No one here can say
The past is all behind us
And all we have is today
And all we have is today

People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
People will always take the long way around
People will always take the long way around
Before you know it you'll be lost and found
Living in sunshine with the shades pulled down
People will always take the long way around
