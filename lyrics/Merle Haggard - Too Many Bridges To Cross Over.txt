Be close to me but please don't ever love me
Don't let your feelings carry you that far
I'll hold you in my arms, buy you clothes and pretty charms
And I'll give you everything except my love

Because there's too many bridges to cross over
And too many places I ain't been
Yeah, there's too many fields of tempting clover
Like an eagle I'm a prisoner of the wind

Will Traveling was the nickname of my papa
And mama said he died 'cause he slowed down
Keep in mind these things I'm saying
'Cause I ain't got the time to staying
Won't be long until my shoes touch distant ground

Because there's too many bridges to cross over
And too many places I ain't been
Yeah, there's too many fields of tempting clover
Like an eagle I'm a prisoner of the wind
