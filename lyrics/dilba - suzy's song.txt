The sun hasnt been merciful,

ouldnt care less about my needs

eft my grounds covered with snow

m stone-frozen and my heart bleeds

ue, what could I say.

hat could I do, I gave it my heart,

ou know its true

o through the darkness as I fall.

oure always there when I call 


uzy 


ell I am here,

hats what you say.

oure not alone

ll share your pain

y world is lost, turned upside down.

here is no need to explain when

oure around

s I get lost in my own madness

iscussing what has been said.

ou keep an eye on the project

nd lead me to my heart from my head.

uzy understands. 


uzy 


s I think again.

he best thing Ive got will

lways remain, the same.

isery, pain and disaster will never turn

nto catastrophe as Ive got Suzy

o share it with me. 


hats my best friend Suzy
