Manage me, I'm a mess
Turn a page, I'm a book half-unread
I want to be laughed at, laughed with just because
I want to feel weightless
And that should be enough

But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a secondhand pick-me-up
And I'm over getting older
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over getting old

And maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

Make believe that I impress
That every word, by design, turns a head
I wanna feel reckless
Wanna live it up just because
I wanna feel weightless
'Cause that would be enough

If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over getting old

And maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

This could be all I've waited for
(I've waited, I've waited for...)
This could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here

And maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
As I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here
