She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything 
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long 
I'd probably break down and cry 

Oh, Oh, Oh
Sweet child o' mine 
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Sweet love of mine 

She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain 
To quietly pass me by

Oh, Oh, Oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
Sweet love of mine 

Oh, Oh, Oh yea
Oh, Oh, Oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh 
Sweet love of mine 

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh,
Sweet love of mine
