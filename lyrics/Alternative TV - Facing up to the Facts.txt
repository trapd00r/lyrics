I kissed her on the station
Clutching the crucifix
She'd handed me
We finally parted
We wanted each other
But she was tied up
I'm facing up to the facts
I'm facing up to the facts
I kissed her on the station
Clutching the crucifix
She'd handed me
We finally parted
We wanted each other
But she was tied up
I'm facing up to the facts
I'm facing up to the facts
I'm facing up to the facts
