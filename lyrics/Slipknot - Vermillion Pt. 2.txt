She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me

I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable

She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't - no
I don't want to be this

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

Won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me

She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
