Tell me something else
Tell me that you will change
Tell me something else
Don't repeat again
Tell me something new
Say another tune
Show me something else
Another side of you

Did u never think that I might go
Did u never think I might not take it any more..

Sow me something else
Sow some grace
â€˜Cause I cant base no love
On the beauty of your face
Convince me in away
So we survive
Show me another you
Show me another side

Did u never think that I might go
Did u never think I might not take it any more..

Tell me something else
Tell me that you will change
Tell me something new
Don't repeat again
Tell me something else
Say another tune
I can't wait no more
Waiting by the door..
