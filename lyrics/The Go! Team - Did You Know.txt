Did you know there's something in the shadow?
It's all around but never makes a sound
And through it all you never see
You never see the fear that hides away
All the thing I feel, but can't say

Did you know you're the echo in my mind?
Did you know I'm the treasure you can't find?
Did you know there's another picture right behind you?

Did you know if you listen it could be, that your carbon copy includes me
You'll never know

So second guess the morning paper
So dream about things, hoping they'll come true
And through it all if you call
I never show the ticker-tape parade
And bury all the words, I can't say

Did you know you're the echo in my mind?
Did you know I'm the treasure you can't find?
Did you know there's another picture right behind you?

If I tell, if I tell you, could it be, that your carbon copy includes me?

I tried a million times, I'll never try again
I tried a million times, I listened to the end
Now it's too late, it's always on the other side
Now it's too late, it's always on the other side, now

Did you know you're the echo in my mind?
Did you know I'm the treasure you can't find?
Did you know there's another picture right behind you?

If I tell, if I tell you, could it be, that your carbon copy includes me?
