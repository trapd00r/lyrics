I have changed
I have changed
Just like you
Just like you

For how long
For how long
Must I wait
I know there's something wrong

Your concrete heart isn't beating
And I've tried to
Make it come alive

No shadows
Just further lights
Now I'm here to rescue you

Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

So silent
No violence
But inside my head
So loud and clear

You're screaming
You're screaming
Covered up with a smile 
I've learned to fear

Just sunshine
And blue sky
Is this is all we get
(This is all we get)
For living here

Come fire
Come fire (fire)
Let it burn and love come racing through

Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

I've learned to lose
I've learned to win
I turn my face against the wind

I will move fast
I will move slow
Take me where I have to go

Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

Ooooh, I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

Ooooh, I'm still alive...
I'm still alive..
