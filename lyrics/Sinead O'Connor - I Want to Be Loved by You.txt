I wanna be loved by you,
Just you and nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone poo poo pi doo
I wanna be kissed by you
Just you, nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone

I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Then to fill a desire 
To make you my own

I wanna be loved by you,
Just you and nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone 

I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Then to fill a desire 
To make you my own
Tada tada ta tada

I wanna be loved by you
Just you, nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone
