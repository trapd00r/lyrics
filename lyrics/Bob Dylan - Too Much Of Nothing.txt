Too much of nothing
Can make a man feel ill at ease
One man's temper rises
While another man's temper might freeze
Now it's a day of confession
And we cannot mock a soul
Oh, when there's too much of nothing
No one has control

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Give her all my salary
On the waters of oblivion

Well, yes, too much of nothing
Can cause a man to weep
He can walk the streets like most and boast of
What he'd like to keep
But it's all been done before
It's all been written in the book
And when there's too much of nothing
Nobody should look

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Give her all my salary
On the waters of oblivion

Now, too much of nothing
Can make a man a liar
It can cause some men to sleep on nails
It can cause others to eat fire
Everybody's doin' somethin'
I've heard it in a dream
But when there's too much of nothing
It just makes a fella mean

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Give her all my salary
On the waters of oblivion
