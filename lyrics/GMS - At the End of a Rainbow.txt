And now I promise you
And I'll be soon so close to you
Like you want me to
Like I wanna to

And now I think I'm in love with you
Ever since got my eyes on you
For the first time 
Yeah for the first time

And no, I'll pick up a star for you
If you love me to
If you love me to
Oh when no, I fly you to the sun
Over the seventh sky
If you love me to

And now dont know what to do
You got me drown so deep into
Into you, so deep into you

And no, I'll pick up a star for you
If you love me to
If you love me to
Oh when no, I fly you to the sun
Till the end of rainbow
End of the rainbow

Here my love
Light your life
Embrace your heart
Here my love
Melting to your soul
Into your soul
Let my love light your life
Embrace your heart
Melting to your soul

End of the rainbow
Over the seventh sky
