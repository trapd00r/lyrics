First time I met you, I didn't know what it was
I tried to understand I didn't get too far
I thought you're special, you made me feel so nice
I wanna be around you, all of the time


Refrain:

Maybe love is finally for me
Oh you make me crazy, I just want more & more
Happiness is all around me
Now I know, yes I know, I finally know


Chorus 1

Heaven, must be missing an angel
Heaven, please don't take him back
heaven must be missin an angel
cause he is right here by my side


It's all so simple, baby when you are here
All my troubles seem to fade away
Everything make sense,I hope this never end
I hope you'd be around me all of the time

(repeat refrain)


Chorus 2

Heaven, must be missing an angel
Heaven, please dont take him back
Heaven, must be missing an angel
Cause he is right here by my side
Right here by my side



Emptiness is gone, I don't feel alone
I am safe by an angel from above
Baby what can I say, you came and rescue me
Now I hope that you are here to stay


(repeat Chorus 2)
