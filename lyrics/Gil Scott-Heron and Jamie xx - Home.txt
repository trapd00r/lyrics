A junkie walking through the twilight, I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea
If I never, never went home again

Home is where I live inside my white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my silent screams
Home is where the needle marks, try to heal my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea
If I never, never went home again

Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads, close your eyes to watch me die
You keep saying, kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it
God, but did you ever try?
To turn your sick soul inside out so that the world, so that the world
Can watch you die

Home is where I live inside my white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my silent screams
Home is where the needle marks, tried and tried and tried
And it might not be such a bad idea
If I never, never went home again
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never
Might not be such a bad idea, seems like I need to get out of here
Might not be such a bad idea, seems like I need to get out of here
Might not be such a bad idea
Might not be such a bad idea
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never, never...
