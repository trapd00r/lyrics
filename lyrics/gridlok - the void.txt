[lyrics: daniel gildenlow]

An eye for an eye.     
A tear for a tear.     
A lie for a lie.     
The weak dress in hatred to hide their fear.      

We cling to symbols for our mind - hour by hour we're losing us.
Defenceless for the weak to bind - second by second abusing us!    
A wound for a wound.     
By silence we breed.     
Learn the hate that keeps us blind, from the hands that hit and feed!
Children teach each other pain - hour by hour they're learning it.     
Dreamers in the wheel of reign - second by second we're turning it around: 

Closing the books of the prophets.     
Closing our eyes for the visions that die    
and then we weep...     
"Why do I still need to cry, when I'm so happy now?"    
Saviors come forth in times of need.     
Prophets seek me - for you will bleed!    
     
Cry little lonely world cry!     
I won't close my eyes.     
I'll be your tears when you're dry, pouring to the ground     

[daniel gildenlow]

Scar by scar    
we're all becoming seeking prophets now.    
     
I won't bear the cross one step further!     
I won't bear your hate any longer!     
Free I will rise!    
(Come to me now - feel the revival. Follow me now - join the revival)     

[daniel magdic]

See me    
believe in me    
hear me - I'll speak to you.     
You are the prophets come forth and I'll bleed for you!    
     
I'll bleed for you...
