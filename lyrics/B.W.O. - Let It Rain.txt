We seemed the perfect team from the very start
Strangers would cheer along, we couldn't do no wrong
Then I allowed a slip and you changed your heart
I made a big mistake, you say you need a break

If only I could turn back the hands of time
Weren't hiding in the crowd, under the darkest cloud

Let it rain, cover up the tears that we try to hide, o-oh
Let it ra-a-a-ain, and when the falls of sights, we never seem to cry

I've tried to greet the day with a smiling face
The sun is shining bright, but I prefer the night
You talk about the need for some private space
But what are spaces for when you have core

If only I could turn back the hands of time
Weren't hiding in the crowd, under the darkest cloud

Let it rain, cover up the tears that we try to hide, o-oh
Let it ra-a-a-ain, and when the falls of sights, we never seem to cry

Let it rain, cover up the tears that we try to hide, o-oh
Let it ra-a-a-ain, and when the falls of sights, we never seem to cry

(Let it rain, cover up the tears that we try to hide, o-oh)
We never seem to cry, we never seem to cry
(Let it ra-a-a-ain, and when the falls of sights)
We never seem to cry

Let it rain, let it rain
