You think I can't see you think I can't hear
You think I won't know
How you wanna lead how you only want control
You are a clown you like to frown
Wearing your crown
And pulling me down is making you feel so high

Your manifesto's just a psychosis
Really impressive, well done placebo 
It's terrifyin'...

You want me to see your majesty
Step on my feet
Get into my head to tell me who I should be
Scatter your word in little crumbs
You think I'm a bird?
You think I won't give you anything in return...
