Oi! x2
Now in the street there is violence, and a lots of work to be done.
No place to hang out our washing and I can't blame all on the sun, oh no.
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue, and then weâ€™ll take it higher. x2

Workin' so hard like a soldier,
And can't afford a thing on TV.
Deep in my heart, I'm a warrior,
And can't get food for them kids, good God.
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue, and then we'll take it higher. x2

Oh no, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue. x4
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue, and then we'll take it higher. x2

Who is to blame in one country? You never can get to the one,
Dealin' in multiplication, and you know you never can to feed everyone,
Oi. x2

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue, and then we'll take it higher. x2
Out in the street, oi, x2
Out in the daytime, oi,
Out in the night.
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue, and then we'll take it higher. x5
