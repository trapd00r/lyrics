We always feel a sacred love in each other
We don't stray from the truth
Oh, feel love many times over

There is something that doesn't change even if time passes
Have you already found it ? It is not special
It may be found in everyday

Time after time I swear not to tell a lie
I wanna feel the same time with you
Night after night Keep on loving
It's worth a try
I wanna live the same time with you

Even if we are in a storm, we won't lose our way
Everyone can't obstruct us
We'll be stronger day by day

You know what is important in order to live
Have I already found it ? It is not difficult
It may be found in everyday

Time after time
This world is a wonderful one!
I wanna feel the same time with you
Night after night Keep on believing
It's worth a try
I wanna live the same time with you

We'll fly to the skies
The skies do not have the dirty thing (feel so free)
We will cross the seas
There is an answer Everything!

Follow me Stay with me Look at me Feel free
Trust me Talk to me Believe me
Follow you Stay with you Look at you I can do
Trust you Talk to you We can do

Time after time
Night after night
Time after time
I swear not to tell a lie
Night after night
I wanna live the same time with you
