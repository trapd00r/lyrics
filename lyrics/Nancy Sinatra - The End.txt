At the end of the rainbow
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure
Our hearts can always spend
And it has a story without any end

At the end of a river
The water stops it's flow
At the end of a highway
There's no place you can go
But just tell me you love me
And you are only mine
And our love will go on
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
