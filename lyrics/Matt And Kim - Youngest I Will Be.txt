Crowd surf, karaoke scene
Lifted like a king, and you can be my queen
Packed in a party bus down in Gulf Shores
Had a flight at 6, lost my voice at 4

Youngest I will be
Youngest I will be in my life
Youngest I will be, oh
Today's the youngest I will be in my life

Heading to go grab some food
Skipped the exit, you were in a driving mood
Reminiscing, life was highways and a van
So we drove as far away as we can

Youngest I will be
Youngest I will be in my life
Youngest I will be, oh
Today's the youngest I will be in my life

I wish I knew, yeah, I wish I knew
Life speeds up and then you're through
I wish I knew, yeah, I wish I knew
Life speeds up and then you're through
Life speeds up and then you're through
Yeah, life speeds up and then you're through
Oh, life speeds up and then you're through

Youngest I will be
Today's the youngest I will be in my life
Youngest I will be, oh
Today's the youngest I will be in my life
