I said who, some kind of superstar,?
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show me how good you are,
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it,
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it,
Show how good you are.

I'm giving you everything
This I swear
Is a promise you will be there

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring
This I swear (I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there

Ah, Hold tight!

Hi Ci Ya Hold Tight

When you're feeling sad and low
We will take you
Where you gotta go
Smiling dancing
Everything is free
All you need is positivity

Colours of the world, Spice up your life
Every boy and every girl, Spice up your life
People of the world, Spice up your life
Ah!

Slam it to the left
If you're having a good time
Shake it to the right
If you know that you feel fine
Chicas to the front
Ha ha
Hi Ci Ya Hold Tight

Hold Tight
Hold Tight

You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win you're always right behind me

And we know that you can go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a faze
Or will this be around forever

Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign, so you know just where you are going

Stop Right Now Thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun

Ah If you wanna be my lover
