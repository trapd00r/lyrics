Not the way it used to be, but it was never a perfect deal.
Fish outta water is all you need 
Internal combustion is bustin my balls, taking my eyesight away.
Throwing darts at a dartboard, slinging slobber across a hall.
Opening a leather-man? To wrench out an inner demon.

Double dutch bus is coming down the street, stopping at the homes of all yr enemies (x3)

And the spotlight is hot, and it'll burn your fingers!
And dry rot can get under trapeze swings.
Hollow as a plaster thing, sitting on a radiator.
And toxic as a brass ring.
Soft sung I'll be fascinating, the loquacious waitress made us leave.
Daddy needs no more grief,
Little darling fell off the roof.

Oh jack snapped into sharper focus, slicing myopic fungus away. Double dutch bus etc. x3.

And the spotlight is hot and it'll burn your fingers! And dry rot will 
get under trapeze swings.
