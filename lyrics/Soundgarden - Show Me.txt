I woke up in a burning house
I was nailed down to the floor
I looked outside my window
And there is going to be a July snow

Show me
Show me
Show me the go

This guy once said
That the tire's only flat on the bottom
But that guy wound up dead
When his girlfriend's daddy shot him

Show me
Show me
Show me the go

The leaf that fell from the tree
The straw that broke the camel's back
My daddy spilled his cup in the river
And that was enough to break the dam

Show me
Show me
Show me the go
