We're not so different you and me
'Cause we both share our share of obscenities
And everybody's got some freaky tendencies
Hidden or admitted 'cause we all got needs

And I make no apologies, (Uh-uh)
I'm into phonography, (Uh-uh)
And I like my bluetooth buttons comin' loose
I need my hands free
Then I let my mind roam
Playing with my ringtone
He got service, I got service
Baby we can talk all night
(Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is clean
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talking, call it phonography,(Hey)

I can final all your commands
But there will be no talk of adding you to my plans
I'll keep you connected long as you understand
That's how we should keep it Mister Telephone Man

And I make no apologies, (Uh-uh)
I'm into phonography, (Uh-uh)
And I like my bluetooth buttons comin' loose
I need my hands free
Then I let my mind roam
Playing with my ringtone
He got service, I got service
Baby we can talk all night
(Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is clean
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talking, call it phonography,(Hey)

Baby, if you're not alone
Take me off speakerphone
What I'm 'bout to say right here
Is just for your ears to hear
If you need to hit me back, hit me back
I got a star 69 for that, for that
(Go)

Let's talk about biology
Make believe you're next to me
Phonography, phonography
Talk that sexy talk to me
Better make sure that the line is clean
Keep it confidential, you and me
Phonography, phonography
Dirty talking, call it phonography,(Hey)

Phonography, phonography
Go
