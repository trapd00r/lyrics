[MC Miker G]
We celebrate seven weeks Miker "G" and Sven
We took a holiday with all our friends
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind
Exactly seven weeks or something crossed my mind
It was the shine of the time we never forget
One morning our parents kicked us out of our beds
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool
But the answer was short: "You gotta go to school!"

[DJ Sven]
G's running up and down and everybody know
Rappin', rockin', poppin' in the street-kid-show
Miker "G" rocks the house and you know what I'm saying
Now when he's on the mic there will be no delaying
So you better run to see him in your neighbourhood
He's rappin', rockin' all the way to Hollywood
Hey, check it out, these are the words we say
Yo, scream with us: we need a holiday!

[Hook]
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Miker "G" and Sven are here to stay)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Hey, check out the new style we just play)
We are going on a summer holiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (Right!) (2X)

[MC Miker G]
I wanna holiday, I screamed a lot
Your only thing, school's the only thing I've got
Sven's parents told me I better go
Cause Sven's hangin' on the street in the street-kid show
In the bar "Rox" what happened to you?
I told him it's my life and I know what I'm doin'
I saw the school I thought I'd never stay
Give me seven weeks again, I need my holiday!

[DJ Sven]
Well, this is my partner with the number one jam
Famous in the Boogie Bronx and Amsterdam
He's the fastest rapper, yo, his name is Miker "G"
His rap is stronger than the sucker MC's
Well, let me show you what my man can do
Rappin', rockin', poppin' and the boogaloo too
But anyway, no more delay
Just listen to the beat-box he will play

[Beatbox Break]

[DJ Sven]
My name is MC Sven, and also deejay
I didn't like the schools, So I took another way
You like the Miker "G", I use my voice
And soon I bought a big Rolls Royce

[MC Mike G]
That's right, my name is Miker "G"
I use the holiday with the M.I.C
On the street was a party bigger than Hollywood
I grew up in this world, started in the neighbourhood

[DJ Sven]
Bite is the thing most rappers do
But I can write my own thing too
I can understand things most rappers say
Cause rappin' is my thing and I do it every day
I'm the number one rapper, yo, my name is Sven
I can rap more raps than a superman can
So I'm the guy on your radio
Also rockin' to the rhythm in stere-ereo

[MC Miker G]
And you don't stop that body rock
And you won't stop that body rock
Yo, spell my name right, I'm Miker "G"
M-I-K-E-R and "G, you see
Yo, "M" is microphone and "G"'s genius
Miker "G" in the house, that's serious
And you know that, and you show that
It's time, Sven, so let's go back!
