I'm gonna leave the planet burning
I'm gonna drive the fastest car
I'm gonna teach them while you're learning
I'm gonna take it very far

I'm gonna ride the steepest mountain
I'm gonna travel to the moon
I'm gonna swim the deepest ocean
I'm gonna leave the planet soon

Sing to me, why won't you sing to me?
Why won't you sing like you did a long, long time ago?
It was such a long, long time ago

It's not a question of devotion
You cannot carve your own tattoo
I'm not a part of your emotion
You can't tell me what to do

I'm gonna star the greatest movie
I'm gonna write the perfect song
I'm gonna make it through the wires
I'm gonna make it all alone

Sing to me, why won't you sing to me?
Why won't you sing like you did a long, long time ago?

You fall easy, but it's easy to give in when you fall
Oh and you fall easy, but it's easy to give in when the rain falls
I won't fall at all

Sing to me, why won't you sing to me?
Why won't you sing like you did a long, long time ago?
Sing to me, why won't you sing to me?
Why won't you sing like you did a long, long time ago?

You've got to sing (You gotta sing)
You never sing like you did before
You've got to sing (You gotta sing)
You've got to sing like you did before
You never sing (You gotta sing)
You've got to sing like you did before
You never sing (You gotta sing), like you did before
Like you did before, like you did before

I've got a hole in my heart I see darkness ahead
I've got a whole lot of living to do before I left
There's a hole in my heart, it was something you said
You've got a whole lot of nothing in that pretty little head

I've got a hole in my heart I see darkness ahead
I've got a whole lot of living to do before I left
There's a hole in my heart, it was something you said
You've got a whole lot of nothing in that pretty little head...
