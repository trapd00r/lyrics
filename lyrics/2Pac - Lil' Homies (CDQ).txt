Fucking Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking
My fucking Lil' Homies
Lil' Homies
Everybody Ducking

(Verse 1)
Just pay attention, here's a story bout my lil' homey
Str8 thuggin', lil bad young mother fucka, you gotta love him
You can catch him in his G-Ride clutching his glock
Screaming outlaw, (west side) mashing on my enemies block
Educated on these cold streets
Getting money, making dummies out the police
Ain't no peace for an adolescent nigga to wild to be a thinker
Bud smoking 24-7, everyday drinking
I got my diploma but I never learned shit in school
Mo money, mo bitches, mo murder fool
Always the young niggaz getting in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch
Bustin' on paper thin mother fuckas
Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them bustas
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin'
My fucking lil' homies

(Chorus)
Lil' homies on the ride
(Yeah nigga)
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight (Die tonight)
Let's get, high tonight (High tonight)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets

(Verse 2)
I remember, when we was just a little G
Flirting with death, playing Russian Roulette
Screaming Kill Me!
Hey there young nigga what you smoking on
Mad at the world cause you came from a broken home
Let us sob cause your mom's is sick
A bunch of adolescent young niggaz spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga if you died let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watching as your mother cry?
Would all your homies ride ?
Or would they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggaz on a mission to complete
Getting g's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a 4-4 and unloaded on the whole front row
BUCK! BUCK!
Try to tell him but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and show
My lil homies

Chorus + Background talking

(Verse 3)
First to bomb, 16 on death row
Busting on them phony mother fuckas cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew, I was a nutcase quick to blast
Living under age but he'll blaze on your bitch ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if there is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streetz ain't no peace
Shell shocked shows making money off of crack sales
Young black male
Unable to change, cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows, the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K-Kastro
Big Malc, Hussein call them Outlawz
Telling the world to be equipped, when these young mother fuckas rip shit
They don't quit, shoot down on me
Pull a pound on me
Bust like they didn't know me
My fucking lil' homies

Lil' homies on the ride
(What's up nigga?)
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
(My lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
(Lil' bad ass mother fucking adolescents)
Runnin' from all these punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run the streets
(My Lil Homies)

Lil' homies on the ride
(What the fuck you niggaz wanna do?)
Niggaz gonna die tonight (Die tonight)
(What nigga?  My fucking Lil' Homies)
Let's get, high tonight (High tonight)
Lil' homies on the mash

Runnin' from all these punk police

Lil' homies on the ride
(Juvenille delinquents ready to bust on you mother fuckas)
Niggaz gonna die tonight
Let's get, high tonight
