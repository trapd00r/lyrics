I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl

Will some cold woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh Babe set me free

Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.

Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.

(Spoken) (Phone rings..Clink of receiver being lifted)
Hello..?
Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.
Will you accept the charges from United States?
(clunk! of phone being put down)
Oh, He hung up! That's your residence, right? I wonder why he hung up? Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?
(Phone rings again...clunk of receiver being picked up)
Hello?
This is United States calling, are we reaching...
(interrupted by phone being put down)
See? He keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering!
