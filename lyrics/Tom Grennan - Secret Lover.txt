Oh I know that there's another
Be my secret lover
You've been sending the signs
Underneath the sheets, maybe we can meet
No need to turn out the light
I don't give a damn about what went down before
Oh be my secret lover, be my secret lover
Underneath the covers, na, na, na

You told me it was naughty
Tell me something that I don't know
Sneaky meetings ending with you in your bathrobe
Monday mornings, Friday night was the done thing
Pretty dirty things

Oh how could this be wrong?
We're young and we're just having fun
Tell me how could this be wrong?
Prime time thrills on my ghost watch skills

Oh I know that there's another
Be my secret lover
You've been sending the signs
Underneath the sheets, maybe we can meet
No need to turn out the light
I don't give a damn about what went down before
Oh be my secret lover, be my secret lover
Underneath the covers, na, na, na

I'm not asking any more of you so don't think
I'll be taking you to dinner with my close friends
From the start I said lets not get attached
You were offered that

Oh how could this be wrong?
We're young and we're just having fun
Tell me how could this be wrong?
Prime time thrills on my ghost watch skills

Oh I know that there's another
Be my secret lover
You've been sending the signs
Underneath the sheets, maybe we can meet
No need to turn out the light
I don't give a damn about what went down before
Oh be my secret lover, be my secret lover
Underneath the covers, na, na, na
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Oh I know that there's another
Be my secret lover
You've been sending the signs
Underneath the sheets, maybe we can meet
No need to turn out the light
I don't give a damn about what went down before
Oh be my secret lover, be my secret lover
Underneath the covers, na, na, na
