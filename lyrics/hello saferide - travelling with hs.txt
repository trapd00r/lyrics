I'm not stupid, I understand that
It would be convenient if
I was better at conversation

I've learned to master the skill throughout the years
Small talking, but after an hour or so I mentally die
I mentally die

And I try, I try, I try, I try
But I can't help but loving more
When being on my own and watching everyday lives
And I try, I try, I wish I wanted
To go see local churches with you
Or to go clubbing where the young ones do
But all I really want to do is watch the everyday lives

My friend, nothing is ever the matter with you
I'm glad to see it though I don't believe it
Won't have to worry, I'll soon have figured you out
I won't tell you when I have but I'll find your weak spot
Your weakest spot, oh, I'll find it

And here is mine: I try to pretend that I like to be part of it all
That I enjoy going out with you and you and you and you and you

And I try, I try, I try, I try
But I can't help but dreaming of
Sitting by myself and watching everyday lives
And I try, I try, but I just want to spend more time
With my mind
It always surprises me every time
And none of you ever do
It doesn't mean that I don't love you
It doesn't mean that I don't love you
It doesn't mean that I don't

And I try, I try, I try, I try
But I can't help but loving more
When being on my own and watching everyday lives
And I try, I try, but I just want to spend more time
With myself
I always surprises myself every time
And none of you ever do
It doesn't mean that I don't love you
