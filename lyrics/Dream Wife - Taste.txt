I've got this taste in my mouth
I don't wanna spit it out
I've got movement in my blood
It's pumping up
I've got the worst taste
I've got the bad taste
I've got the worst taste
And I've got the best taste
I've got the best taste

And all I wanna do is taste you
I've got the worst taste
I've got the bad taste

I've got this taste in my mouth
And I don't wanna spit it out
I've got movement in my blood
And it's pumping up
I've got the worst taste
I've got the best taste
I've got the worst taste
And I've got the best taste
I've got the best taste

And all I wanna do is taste you
I've got the worst taste
I've got the bad taste
All I wanna do is just taste you
I've got the worst taste
I've got the bad taste

But you've got something that I've never seen
So can we lie next to each other and try not to fall asleep?
Oh, you've got something that I've never seen
And it scares me, it thrills me
I can't stop shaking my knees

And all I wanna do is just taste you
I've got the worst taste
I've got the bad taste
All I wanna do is just taste you
I've got the worst taste
I've got the bad taste

You've got something that I've never seen
You've got something that I've never seen
You've got something that I've never seen
You've got something that I've never seen
