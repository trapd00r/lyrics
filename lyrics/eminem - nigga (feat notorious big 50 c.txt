I got 50 Cent
I got G-Unit
D-Twizzyin this bitch
With Obie Triiiiice
So watch what you say
Before you call our name
If you say one more thing
It won't be nice

Here we go
I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jellous of us to love us
You ain't it
G-Unit made it
And Obie's comin'
D-Twizzy's comin'
You sick to your stomach
50% is 50-Cent
The other 50% is who's color skin it is
Don't even consider takin' our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin' to get too intriqette into it
I'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cause then it's gunna get to the point where it escalates into some other shit
Then I'm a flip
Then I'm a get to stompin in my Air Force One's
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's gunna feel like there's so many feet kickin you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
Thinkin' they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have pink tiggle me
Hickory dickory dock tickoty tock tickety a little bit of the diggity dock diggity
Mixed with a little bit of the jigga-ja-jigga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa sho
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
We gon' fuck around and steal your people
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa sho

Shady in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes to rock the mic RIGHT!
Still watch what you say to me punk 'cause I'm off probation in less then 6 MONTHS!
Ha ha whoo
Shady Records
Still Aftermath
And don't thik we don't hear you mutha fucka's talkin'
We see y'all
But we just gon' sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck y'all do
