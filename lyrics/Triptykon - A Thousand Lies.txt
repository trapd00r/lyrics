Son of none
Risen from dust
To carve my cross
The altar of sacrifice

Son of none
Spreader of lies
Thy will be done
As you die

Everything you touch
Every word you speak
Every lie you shape
Every seed you sow
Dies

Son of none
Soiled with my blood
Serpent below the cross
Still you fail

Son of none
The blackened sun
Self-appointed god
Cult of one

Blessed those
Who do believe
Those who will
Die in you

A raging flood
Of deceiving words
A tainted world
Of livid shame
