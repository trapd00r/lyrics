Rock steady, baby - That's what I feel now;
Let's call this song exactly what it is...

Step n' move your hips with a feelin' from side to side;
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride...
And while you're movin', rock steady, rock steady, baby;
Let's call this song exactly what it is...
(What it is, what it is, what it is...)
It's a funky and low down feelin' 
(What it is...) In my hips from left to right;
(What it is...) What it is is I might be doin' 
(What it is...) This funky dance all night....
Oh, oh! (Clap your hands in the air! Got a feelin', ain't got a care!)
Oh-ah! (What fun to take this ride! Rock steady will only slide!)

Rock steady! Rock steady, baby.
Rock steady! Rock steady, baby.

Step n' move your hips with a feelin' from side to side;

It's a funky and low down feelin'

Rock steady, baby!
Rock steady... whoo! Rock steady...

Rock! Steady! 
Rock! Steady!

(What it is...) It's a funky and low down feelin',
