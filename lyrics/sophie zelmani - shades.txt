What was that
Did you wanna steel a kiss
Where were you
When you brought me in to this

In a shade
There's a loss of light
But that's what we got
And I know it can hurt
To do things right

Shade

You got
You got me so frail
And frail I'll leave

Our face
To a stronger day
My recall
To many things
It will always hurt
But that's a common thing

In the shades
In the shades

Does it matter
What I can understand
It will always be you
Who let go of that hand

I am sad
Over things you say
Your words
Will always hurt me
On our way

Shades
Shades

Worries
For where you belong
Gets me in trouble
When you've got your hallow on

Let those nights
Be only yours
Remember hurt
Remember sore

In the shades
In the shades
