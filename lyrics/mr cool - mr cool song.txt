Whatever happened to Mr Cool
Somebody took him back to school 
He thought he knew but he did not 
Now his name is Mr Hot.

Oh Mr Hot, Mr Hot don't think your through cause you're not 
You still don't have what you've got 
Oh no no no no

Whatever happened to Know-It-All 
Knew how to climb but not to fall 
He had to fall from so high above 
The only place deep enough was love.

Oh Mr Hot, Mr Hot don't think your through cause you're not 
You still don't have what you've got 
Oh no no no no

Banana, banana
Sleep in between two beds is a fiddle
you're bound to fall through the hole in the middle
You want your cake and eat it too
One day the cake turn around and eat you 

Oh Mr Hot, Mr Hot don't think your through cause you're not 
You still don't have what you've got 
Oh no no no no

Whatever happened to Mr Cool
Somebody took him back to school 
He thought he knew but he did not 
Now they call him Mr Hot.
