Got a bird what whistles, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird ... it would sing, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird ... it would sing
Without my Corrina, sure don't mean ..., sure don't mean a natural thing

I learned to love you baby, baby for I call
Honey for I call your name, baby for I call
Honey for I call your name, I Wouldn't Trade Your Love For Money
Honey You Are My Warm Heart, Baby You Are
My Warm Hearts Flame

Have mercy, have mercy, baby on my hard luck
Honey on my hard luck soul, baby on my hard luck
Honey on my hard luck soul

I got a rainbow round my shoulder
Looks like silver, shines like Klondike1 gold

Well I love you honey, honey tell the world, baby tell the world I do
Honey tell the world I do, baby tell the world I do
Ain't no woman in fourteen counties, love me baby like the way I do

I got a bird what whistles, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird ... it would sing, baby got a bird
Honey got a bird ... it would sing
Without Corrina, sure don't mean, sure don't mean a natural thing
