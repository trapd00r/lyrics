I wish you joy
I wish you fun
I wish you rainbows
In your sun

I wish you [.........]
I wish you sky
I wish you rivers
that never cry

But most of all
I wish you love
Most of all
I wish you love

I wish you clouds
I wish you light
I wish you sweet dreams
In your night

I wish you sea
I wish you sand
I wish you stardust
In your hand

But most of all
I wish you love
Most of all
I wish you love

I wish you peace
I wish you calm
I wish you fortune
In your palm

I wish you [........]
I wish you flowed
No matter where you
You may go

But most of all
I wish you love
Most of all
I wish you love

Most of all
I wish you love
And most of all
I wish you love

Which I can say
So I can reach
You'll be a man one day
And you'll go your own way

Until then 
I wish you all
that you require
I wish you everything
Your heart desires

I wish you young
I wish you bold
I wish you time
Down streets of gold

But most of all
I wish you love
Most of all
I wish you love

Most of all
I wish you love
And most of all
I wish you love

And most of all
I wish you love
And most of all
I wish you love
