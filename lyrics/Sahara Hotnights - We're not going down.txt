We're not going down on our knees for your sake
Straight on that's the way we know what it takes
We've made up our minds and we're back on the scene
No use for bad advice 'cause we know what we need

Everything was going so right till you came along
Just try to shake us down from the sky
You've got it all wrong

Nice try what a waste but we told you before
Hands up, quick mistakes we won't take it no more
Too drunk to make sense, too short to stand tall
We saw you lose your faith we can't wait for your fall
