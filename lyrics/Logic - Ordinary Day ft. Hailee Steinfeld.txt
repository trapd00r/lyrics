[Logic:]
It was an ordinary day until
I saw you crawl around my way
And the night goes
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
It was an ordinary day until
I saw you crawl around my way
And the night goes
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on (Alright)
On, and on, and on, and on (Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright)

Cocaine in the back hard liquor to the right
Don't really drink but shit I might
This the type of shit I like
Everyone just livin' life
Live a life like this is dangerous
Everybody just ain't famous
Everyone from the young to the old
Anyone with a little bit of money get shameless
You know you fuckin' bougie
You know you fuckin' dumb
You know you'll get the shit smacked outta you back where I'm from
Hol' up
Wait up
This shit is made up
Feel like I'm dreamin'
Imma wake up
Girl, I can see you through your makeup
I can tell by the look in your eyes
I can tell by the fact you don't know act
I see right through your lies
I'm a real muthafucker whatcha know 'bout that
Like yeah wassup
Everybody out here actin tough
I might get drunk call yo bluff
This right here yeah that's yo nuff
Yeah you know me, yeah I know you
But bitch I been here before you
Imma show you, Imma show you, Imma show you

So they tell me that they love me but I know thats it's all for show, it's all for show
And I tell her that she love me but she know thats it's all for show, it's all for show
