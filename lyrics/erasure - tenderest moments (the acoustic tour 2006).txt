We go down to a foreign land 
Dive through the clouds 
You hold the guided light in your hands 

This must be all that there is 
Times don't come much more beautiful 

You can show me places that my eyes have never seen 
I'm following you, where are you taking me to? 
You could be my angel who just walks out of a dream 
I'm following you, where are you taking me to? 
I have all faith in you 
And these tenderest moments 

We circle low 
Embrace the night as she draws us in 
A holy shroud, a veil to hide our tenderest moments 

This must be all that there is 
Times don't come much more beautiful 

You can show me places that my eyes have never seen 
I'm following you, where are you taking me to? 
You could be my angel who just walks out of a dream 
I'm following you, where are you taking me to? 
I have all faith in you 
And these tenderest moments 

This must be all that there is 
Times don't come much more beautiful 

You can show me places that my eyes have never seen 
I'm following you, where are you taking me to? 
You could be my angel who just walks out of a dream 
I'm following you, where are you taking me to? 
I have all faith in you 
And these tenderest moments
