You don't need analizin
It is not so surprisin
That I feel very strange but nice
Your heart goes pitter patter
I know just what's the matter
Because I've been there once or twice
Put your head onb my shoulder
You need someone that's older
A rub down with a velvet glove...
There is nothin' you can't take
To relieve that pleasant ache
You're not sick you're just in love
