Singing with Spoken 
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Nah man, not quite finished yet.

Girl I think you just might of tried to pull a mo'fuckin' fast one I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, tryin' to play games, see this saw blade
See the silhouette, of a stalker, in your walkway, better cooperate

Or get sauteed, and rotisseried, while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet, you can hear a mo'fuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a mogwai

'Cause it will turn into a gremlin, and run over kids women and men
Vnnn-vnnn motor's so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin', not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend spend, even ten cents on you, since when

Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty, just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe, while he's trying to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go ya'll, 'cause

(You don't own me) Now here we go go go

Get up baby get a move on, like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey, you called
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it, evil I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit

Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every mo'fuckin' chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause, you can bet your ass that, we gone get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans, when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad you gon' have Kurt Cobain askin', to autograph a bloodstained napkin

Unfashionable and 'bout as rational, as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line run it up the flag pole
With Elton, see if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at
Me bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it 

Till it pops up, ya'll are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you've stopped up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth, till your speakers crap out, *fart* Ohp what
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette, "Chik-Chigarette"
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me, so do not strut my way slut, because

(You don't own me) Now here we go go go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch, and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers, 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem, run boy

Every flow got it mastered, so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, yeah in other words I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any

Eat your heart out Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous, fuck an animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya hoe
Shady I don't understand your flow, understand my flow, bitch I flow like Troy
Polamalu's hair boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare boy

I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man is there a void, all this weak shit, what am I steroids
Well bitch I'm back, with some shit for that ass, and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids, and remember boys

(You don't own me) Now here we go go go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
Till next time
Haha
