Blame me

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R.A.W R.A.W

You lookin' at the grand wizard 
war lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches 
to pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona 
Ain't nothing like a man that can do wha he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the cornna
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up westside California
Nigga I'm hot as phoenix Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law: keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it 
And recognize I'm a captain you a lieutenant

I can say what I want to say 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga 
ya spit saliva and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta and why should I change that 
fuck all you muthafuckas tryin' to change rap (Say what, say what?)
But aren't you the same cat 
that sat back when they brought cocaine back? (Say what, say what?)
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach 
how you muthafuckas gonna tell me don't say that
You the ones that we learned it from 
I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed hoe 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' 'bout real life 
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat
It's a party not a jack (for real)
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal (fuck them, fuck them)
And don't be material 
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot vaness and imperial
Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spritual
Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't got to be fake cause He is my homie

If I sell a little crack 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet 
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow flow flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow
It's R.A.W R.A.W

Oh yeah and another thing for all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on tv talkin' about gangsta rap
Cause 9 times at of 10 you don't know the fuck you're talkin' about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
And stay the fuck out of mines
