Intruder alert continues to flirt
And stagger and trip up my life 
The sinister thoughts unfairly rots 
My brain can't put up a fight 
Oh the nightmare
Can it be put to an end
The fact is I know I'm not dreaming again 

Steel on my skin 
Oh carve with that knife 

Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis of life
Carving my mind 
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis of life 

Mentally, Physically draining my skull
Of every thought entering (how)
Feelin' just like a voodoo doll 
About to be struck by a pin 
Oh the threshold comes to a staggering halt 
Even though the guilty don't know it's his fault 

Steel on my skin 
Oh carve with that knife 

Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis of life 
Carving my mind 
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis of life 

Oh the knifes dug in 
Carving my life 
Oh the life is him 
Overflowing amount of impatience 

Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis of life 
Carving my mind 
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis of life
Crisis of life
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis of life
Carving my mind 
I'm falling, I'm falling 
Crisis a crisis of life 
I'm falling, I'm falling Crisis of life 
I'm losing it, Crisis of life 
Crisis of life
