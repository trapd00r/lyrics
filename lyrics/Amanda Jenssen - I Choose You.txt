You led me down from my ledge
Gave my circle a brand new edge
You found the pieces left of me
Sewed them together carefully

And I'm not gonna lie to you
I'm not gonna do the things I've learned I should do
I'm not gonna hide
'Cause I choose you
I choose you
I choose you

You lift me up when I am low
You are the sun that makes me grow
Let's get rid of old remorse
'Cause the truth is that I am yours

And I'm not gonna lie to you
I'm not gonna do the things I usually do
I'm not gonna hide
'Cause I choose you
I choose you
I choose you

Don't care what they say
About re-played mistakes
'Cause everything changes
Starting today

I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
I choose you
