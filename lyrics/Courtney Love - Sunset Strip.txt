Sitting here on top of the world
I got everything
I need from this world
Oh tonight, I got it right
Just one time

Cruising down the Sunset Strip
And there is nothing that's not,
That's not within my grip
Oh tonight, I can fly
I can fly

Look at me for the very last time
I've climbed so high
I've got no place left to climb
And I know, no tomorrow

Oh, Rock star, pop star, everybody dies
All tomorrow's parties
They have happened tonight
And I know that I won't see tomorrow

Sitting on the Hollywood sign
Watching the girls get off the bus
Watching the danger in their eyes
When they leave with broken hearts
They're shredded valentines

I came here from a dirty dark street
There was no one there to protect me
To make the nightmares go away
IT HAS TO SPARKLE
IT HAS TO SHINE
So hard

Look at me for the very last time
I've climbed so high
I've got no place left to climb
And I know, no tomorrow

Rock star, pop star, everybody dies
All tomorrow's parties
They have happened tonight
And I know that I won't see tomorrow

Turn off all the porno please
Been drowning here for days
Bad food, bad sex, bad TV, internet
Take all these stupid pills away

Flying down the boulevard
I'm coming down so fast
I'm coming down so hard
And I've said I can't stop
All those voices in your head

I don't sleep, I never dream
And to shut them up
Now I just keep screaming 
I run away
It's the last time
It's the last time

Look at me for the very last time
I've climbed so high
I've got no place left to climb
Now I know, no tomorrow

Before the sparkle in my eyes
Turns to strychnine
All this beating heart is still a valentine
Gonna ride this thing until the wheels fall off
Cause girls like me, we always get what we want
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Diamonds hard promises and million dollar bills
All the nights we're wasting in the Holloywood Hills
Cause we know, we're to good for tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yesterday's girl or tomorrow's hot teens
Were you jerking off to her
Or were you jerking off to me?
And I know, that I won't know tomorrow

Yeah, you want my magic tower
You want my- throw it all way
I'm throwing them out
Its a wonder that you wait

Lawsuit, diamond's Guns N Rubies
Baby, au revoir
You rock'n'roll bitches
You can get what you want, yeah

Your were made for me 
and I'm made for you
With The keys to the bel-air and the chateau too

Your little sugar coated world
It is rotten to the core
I didn't know you were born without a soul

I've got voices screaming in my head
Are you jerking off in your bed?
It's not punk, it's not cool
It's not even boring
And it's not Eminem who's gonna save me

They're for real life
They tried to steal my soul
I got pills when Famous
I got pills when you're old 
I got pills cause I'm blonde
I got pills cause you're dead
I've got cause I am the worst and best dressed
I've got pills cause I feel more than 21
Got pills cause I know, baby, you're not the one
I've got pills for my coochie
Cause baby, I'm sore
I've got pills cause you're fat
I've got pills cause I'm bored

Cruising down the Sunset Strip
And there is nothing that's not,
That's not within my grip
Oh tonight, I got it right
Just one time
