[1st verse(Missy)]
Boy let me free your mind, let's hook up tonight 
Take you on a flight, high, high
Make you warm inside,I won't waste your time 
My love is so divine, it feels like I'm on...

[chorus]
Ecstaacyy, I'm willing, to do all the things I said I wouldn't do, on...
Ecstaacyy, the feeling, makes me feel like I'm in love with you

[2nd verse(Missy)]
Boy look into my eyes, I'm so energized
Make it last long time, touch meeeee
Everything feels sweet, my body feel your breeze
Up against me, it feels like I'm on ...

[chorus]

[Missy]
(Oh it feels like I'm on)
Ecstaacyy, I feel like I can, jump in and do something
Feel so free, I feel like makin love to you 
So what you wanna do? (AHH..ahhh..AHH!)

Ecstaacyy, I feel like I can, jump in and do something
Feel so free, Ifeel like I'm in love with you 
So what you wanna doooo?

[chorus]
