You look nice alright
And I like the way you nod after everything I say
Like it actually means something
To you

And I like your record collection
Townes and Jens with a hint of Rickie Lee
And you've cleaned up the bathroom, made a really nice soup
But a bit too much sci-fi in your shelf with DVD's

There are things you need to know about me
I'm weak right now, so weak right now
I need proof before I dare to open this heart
So I prepared a quiz for you

Would you freak out if I said I liked you?
Do you walk the line
Is your IQ higher than your neighbour's
And is it very much higher than mine

Can you sleep when I grind my teeth
Do you look away if I slob when I eat
Will you let me be myself
Can you at all times wear socks, because I'm still scared of feet

And if I'd fall, would you pick me up
And if I'd fall, would you pick me up

Do you talk in the middle of Seinfeld
Do you read more than two books a month
Do you get racist or sexist when you've had a few
Is it fine if I make more money than you

Have you slept with any people I work with
Is there anyone you'd rather wish I'd be
Do you still keep pictures of old girlfriends
Are they prettier than me

And if I'd fall, would you pick me up
If I'd fall, would you pick me up
