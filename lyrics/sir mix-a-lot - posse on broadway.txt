My Posse's On Broad Way
My Posse's On Broad Way

Me and Kid Sensation, at home away from home
In the Black Benz Limo with the Cellular Phone
I'm callin up the Posse, It's time to get drippin
I'm freakin each sunroof, to keep ya suckers trippin'
Everybody's lookin', if your jealous, turn around
The amg kit keep us closer to the ground
We gettin' good grip from the 50 series (gator back) tires
The Alpine bumpin, but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 Kickdrum, makes the girlies get dumb
We're rollin' Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Everytime we do this, Sucker MC's wanna battle
I'm the Man they love to hate, The JR Ewing of Seattle
Pickup the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Headin for the strip, yes were lookin' for some action
The Limo's kinda crowded the whole car was leanin back
Maharji's watchin TV with 2 girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King, the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street, So Posse move ahead
We all look kinda suave, the crew you can't forget
The Mix A Lot Posse, cold rippin up the set

My Posse's On Broad Way
Posse Up

A Rollin' in my Posse was gettin' kinda board
There's not another Posse with More Points scored
We don't walk around like criminals
Or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation
Is the Teen-Aged lady killer Maharaji's on the def side
Dancin like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy, people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot of money
Clockin lotsa dollars, we all got gold
Crusin in his Benz, and got no place to go
Wheelin 23rd, we saw nothin' but thugs
The girlies was to skinny from smokin' all them drugs
Cause the Rockman got 'em and there butts just droped
The freaks looked a depressed because our Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss, She said I was the best
She's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress
OR she's lookin' at me freaky and she's getting undressed) (Godzilla remix)
The closer that we get the crazier we feel
My Posses on Broadway it's time to get ill

My Posse's On Broad Way
My Posse's On Broad Way
Posse Up

Crusin Broadway and wheels spin slow
Rollin' with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college were lookin' for a ride
We tried to pick 'em up but we had no room inside
We put 'em on the trunk, we put 'em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's gettin' bigger there's much to many freaks
My mufflers draggin, my suspension gettin' weak
Now the freaks are gettin' hungry, and Mix A lot's treatin
We stopped at taco bell for some Mexican eatin
But taco bell was closed the girls were on my tip
They said go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dicks
Dick's is the place where the cool hang out
The swass like to play
And the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand? so big we walk in 2's
Were gettin' dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation droped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeeser from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriends illin he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB Cold sprayed the boy with mace
'Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If ya don't have game then let her leave you world
We took his girl with us with him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch of dudes
Your broke cold cryin about the Rockman blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset
She's with the Mix A lot Posse on the Broadway Set
