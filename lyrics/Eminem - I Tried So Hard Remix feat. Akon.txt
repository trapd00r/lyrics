Bone Thugs Akon yeah

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard,
I tried hard... but I guess I
Gotta try harder.

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin' a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin' crazy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off till later.

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

It's like I'm takin' five steps forward, and ten steps back
Tryin' get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh,
I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and
Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain
I keep inflinctin on my family (family)
Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'
And losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man
And I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin' not to panic

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

I see thangs won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it
Keeps pullin me back mayne
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no 9 to 5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean
Hustlers ballin in force I'm tryin' make that major league
So we never leave never, till the sun came up
Gotta get it nope no leavin' no rush
Today games they play gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause i...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough
