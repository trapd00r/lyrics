Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega 

I like a tombstone cause it
weathers well
and if it stands or if it crumbles
only time will tell


if you carve my name in marble
you must cut it deep
there'll be no dancing on the gravestone
you must let me sleep
and time is burning burning burning
it burns away


I don't need to see the gates of 
famous men
but I do try to see the kingdom
every now and then


if you ask me where it is it's on a 
humble map
and I know that to enter in the doorway
show your handicap
and time is burning burning burning
it burns away
