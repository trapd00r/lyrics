Oooooh yeah
Looking back,
I know I was walking around in disguise, 
In disguise, 
I was just as lost and I needed a guide, 
And the moment that you came to change my life, 
Use life burn my heart and make me smile, 
Coz' you and I know that,

I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around,
I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around,
I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around.

Things I had,
All fading away a minute and I,
Feel alive,
You have twisted all of my troubles inside, 
You've refilled my heart and stopped me drown, 
Coz' you and I know baby,

I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around,
I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around,
I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around (Turn my world around),
I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around.

Ooooooh
Use life burn my heart and make me smile, 
And you and I know baby, 
Turn my world around, Oh yeah,

I'm a different person
Yeah, Turn my world around,
I'm a different person
