I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
And every single day, it's just another climb
Worked so long and hard and I still got nothing at all
There ain't no reason to this grind
Heart is cold, my soul is old, my wall is stone
If you came for free love, don't waste your time
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
Every single day, it's just another climb
Don't waste my time
Unless you came to climb
Unless you came to climb

Brick by brick, flesh and bone
Bound here this behind this wall alone
Protecting this heart, carved in stone
The stone is a diamond, it's part of a throne
Part of my throne, that's the seat of a king
I'm looking for a queen, nah mean, Norma Jean
Where you at, (baby gal, what's your tattoo key?)
What's your history, tell your mystery
A private dancer, hold up, pause it
Baby, everybody got some bones in their closet
They just hatin', it's all chit-chatter
And the feels of a heart, girl it really don't matter
Lime to the lemon, lemon to the lime
If murder was an art, I'd make your heart mine
I'd put it in a box to cherish for all time
Your love will never perish, girl, just make the climb

I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
And every single day, it's just another climb
Worked so long and hard and I still got nothing at all
There ain't no reason to this grind
Heart is cold, my soul is old, my wall is stone
If you came for free love, don't waste your time
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
Every single day, it's just another climb
Don't waste my time

Cause everyday the grind, it just gets harder
Unless you came to climb
And final finish line keeps looking farther
Don't waste my time
They need all the sheep out to the slaughter
Unless you came to climb
I'm brushing my teeth with holy water
Don't waste my time
One step away from my damnation
Unless you came to climb
Two days away from my starvation
Don't waste my time
Gotta pay for my daughter's medication
Unless you came to climb
So I'll sell you a piece of my salvation
Don't you waste my time

I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
And every single day, it's just another climb
Worked so long and hard and I still got nothing at all
There ain't no reason to this grind
Heart is cold, my soul is old, my wall is stone
If you came for free love, don't waste your time
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
Every single day, it's just another climb
Don't waste my time
Unless you came to climb
Unless you came to climb
