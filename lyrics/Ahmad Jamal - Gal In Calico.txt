Like A Mole In The Ground
Like a Mole in the Ground (Tom Meltzer)
Based on Bascom Lunsford's "Mole in the Ground"

I wish that I was a mole in the ground
Like a mole in the ground, I would root that mountain down
Tree by tree and town by town
I wish I was a mole in the ground

And I wish that I was a lizard in the spring
Like a lizard in the spring, I would hear the robin sing
I'd feast upon the robin's eggs and I'd not regret a thing
I wish I was a lizard in the spring

But I'm just a man who loves a woman who's drifting away
The miles and miles between us grow wider every day
I wish that I was strong or free or not in love or dead
Better still, I wish I was a mole in the ground

I don't like working for the railroad man
For the railroad will kill you just as fast as it can
It drinks your blood like wine and throws your bones to the wind
I don't like working for the railroad, man

And Tempy oh Tempy wants a $100 shawl
But I got $90, $90, that is all
Our house is not a home it's just a roof and four walls
But Tempy wants a $100 shawl

CHORUS

Tempy, oh Tempy let your hair hang low
Let your hair hang low while I rosin up my bow
We'll pretend we are lovers like we were so long ago
Tempy, let your hair hang low

I wish I was a mole in the ground etc
Don't wait up for me 'cause tonight I think I'm going downtown
