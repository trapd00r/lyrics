Sing a song of love to me
As the shadow starts to grow
And I won't be sad and lonely anymore

'Cause if you sing a song of love to me
I will always find a smile
That will warm my cold, cold heart
Just for awhile

Songs of love i know so well
Yea I've seen some days and had some times
Lucky boy i can hear you say
You think my sun does nothing but shine

So sing a song of love to me
One more time before I go
And i won't be sad and lonely
No I won't be sad and lonely
Anymore
