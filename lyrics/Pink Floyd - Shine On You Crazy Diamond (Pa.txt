Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond

Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond

And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
Sail on the still breeze

Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion and shine
