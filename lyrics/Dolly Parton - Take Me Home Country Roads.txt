Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

If I should stay
All my memories, they gather round her
I would only be in your way
A miner's lady, stranger to blue water
So I'll go, but I know
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
I'll think of you every step of the way
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
(I will always love you)
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way

Country roads (Country roads), take me home (Take me home)
To the place I belong
(I will always love you)
West Virginia, mountain mama
(Will always love you)
Oh, take her home, country roads

Oh, I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
And I will always love you
On the road again
I will always love you
I just can't wait to get on the road again
Country roads
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
I will always love you
I can't wait to get on the road again
Take me home, country roads
I will always love you
I'll always love you
