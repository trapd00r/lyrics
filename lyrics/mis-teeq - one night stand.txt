Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Job done
Wanna have fun
Gonna call my girls
Gonna my hair done
So I dress tight
With my heels high
And I think
About the moves
I'm a pull tonight

When I roll up out front
Guys looking over
Like they want some
Make way sexy
For me and my ladies

Hear the sound of
The DJ playing our jam
Glass down
Grab a man
Move to the floor
It's time to get down
Ding ding
First round
Hands on my hips
As we start to dip
Close range
Full clip
Temptations
Sensations
Vibrations
My one night stand

Act wild
But I got style
'Cause I ain't sipping
If it ain't crystal
High class
Nice as*
Spend your money
But I got my own cash
Good vibes
So right
Thank you for
The dance tonight
Feel free baby
Keep looking
'Cause you can't have me

Hear the sound of
The DJ playing our jam
Glass down
Grab a man
Move to the floor
It's time to get down
Ding ding
First round
Hands on my hips
As we start to dip
Close range
Full clip
Temptations
Sensations
Vibrations
My one night stand

Hey yo
I said, "Get up, get up"
It's a one night stand
Here I come again
With my rhyming slang
Ride to the rhythm
As I flip this sound
Flip this sound
We're gonna move around


M-M-M-M-Mis-Teeq
We're coming back again
Love of the music
Inside your membrane
I'm gonna burn you
With my lyrical flame
Enter the game
Come follow me
It's time to play
Break down

Now don't you go and
Get the wrong impression
It's just a dance
With my girlfriends
Hanging out
To mislead you
Wasn't my intention
Nothing more to say

Hear the sound of
The DJ playing our jam
Glass down
Grab a man
Move to the floor
It's time to get down
Ding ding
First round

Hear the sound of
The DJ playing our jam
Glass down
Grab a man
Move to the floor
It's time to get down
Ding ding
First round
Hands on my hips
As we start to dip
Close range
Full clip
Temptations
Sensations
Vibrations
My one night stand

Hear the sound of

My one night stand

It's a one night stand
Misteeq
Sunship

Here we go
Here we go
Here we go again

Here we go
Here we go
Here we go again

It's a one night stand
