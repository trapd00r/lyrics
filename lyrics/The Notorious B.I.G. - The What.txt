The Notorious B.I.G.:
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playin' the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold wondered, "What you talkin' 'bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches, I like 'em brainless, guns, I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fuckin' Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me
You don't want to fuck with Biggie

Method Man:
(T-H-O-D Man, here I am)
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin' where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga, stop bitchin', button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin' is a can of ass-whippin'
Hey, I'll be kickin', you son, you doin' all the yappin'
Actin' as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island, and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga, ya punk nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Kickin' down your god damn doors (and it goes a little somethin' like this)

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honey, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on

Method Man:
Verse two, comin' with that Olde E brew
Meth-ical, puttin' niggas back in ICU
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin' down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin' carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentleman, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
(Assume the position) Stop, look, and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens, bitch

The Notorious B.I.G.:
Welcome to my center, honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the Pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads, I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of makin' hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up, 'cause hoes is irritatin' like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin' rap phenomenon, plus
(I got more Glocks and Tecs than you)
I make it hot (Niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honey, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on

Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honey, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on
