Times at night when I look out to the sky
I start to think of you and I asked myself why
"Why do I love you?" - I think and smile
Because I know the List could run on for miles

The whisper of your voice, the warmth of your touch
My feelings are so strong and I love you so much
"Why do I love you?" - I think and smile
Because I know the list could run on for miles

Always and forever...
