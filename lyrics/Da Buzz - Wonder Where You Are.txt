I see you go again 
To escape from the pain 
Shouldn't left you alone (no)
But baby listen to me
I can't help how I feel
Theres an end of my love

You can run you can cry
But look deep in my eyes
Our love must be through
I think I'm loosing it all
I don't want you to fall
So take my hand
And tell me were you are

I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are

You went away from it all
Couldnt take it no more
I fear you are gone
Would like to see you again
Say I never walk away
But I know it's to late
(and I know it's to late)

You can run you can cry
But look deep in my eyes
Our love must be through
I think I'm loosing it all
I don't want you to fall
So take my hand
And tell me were you are

I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are

(wonder were you are)

Maybe you?r walking in my dreams
Maybe I just wanna hold you
I need to find the love I once had for you

I wonder were you are
I wanna know were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are

I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you
I wonder were you are

I need to know
(I really need to know who you are)
I wonder were you are
I need to know
I wonder were you are
I need to find the love I once had for you (i need you love)
I wonder were you are
