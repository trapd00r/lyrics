Maybe we can wake the dogs tonight
Maybe we can see the morning light
Maybe everyone can go to hell
Maybe I don't need your calls for help
Again, I'm your friend

I'm just waiting on the wild sun
I'm just waiting on the wild sun
And I saw my friends, and I saw my friends
I'm just waiting on the wild sun

Crash and tumble on through my mind
An eerie feeling running down my spine
Day slowly turning into night
My hands are shaky and I don't feel right
Again, my friend

I'm just waiting on the wild sun
I'm just waiting on the wild sun
And I saw my friends, and I saw my friends
I'm just waiting on the wild sun

Baby, are the lies they told us all true?
I don't know what to do
I don't know how to stop this time
Maybe all the dreams I had were never real
I don't know how to feel
I don't know how to feel this

I'm just waiting on the wild sun
I'm just waiting on the wild sun
And I saw my friends, and I saw my friends
I'm just waiting on the wild sun

I'm just waiting on the wild sun
I'm just waiting on the wild sun
I'm just waiting on the wild sun
I'm just waiting on the wild sun
