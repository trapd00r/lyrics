Oh Baby
I dedicate this to all the pretty girls
To all the pretty girls... to oh...
All the pretty girl in the world
And the ugly girls too
But to me your pretty anyway baby.

You give me your number
I call you up
You act like your pussy don't interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fuckin' me
But I have a little problem with you not fuckin' me
Baby you know I'm a take care of you
Cause you say you got my baby & I know it ain't true.
Is it a good thing?? No, it's bad bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch
So I walk on over with my Cristal
Bitch ass niggas put away your pistols
Dirty won't be havin' it in this house
Cause bitch I'll cripple your style
Now that you heard my calmin' voice
Couldn't get another nigga, hoochie won't get moist
If you want to look good and not be bummy
Girl you better give me that money.

Hey, dirty, baby I Got Your Money
Don't you worry
I said hey, baby I Got Your Money.

Yo, so I glanced at the girl girl glanced at me
I whispered in her ear "You wanna be with me?"
You want to look pretty though in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat & I let you all know
Just dance like your caught up in the Holy Ghost trance
If you stop, I'm a put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the ODB as you can see
FBI, don't you be watchin' me
I don't want no problem 'cause I'll put you down
In the ground where you can not be found
I'm just Dirt Dog tryin' to make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey
Radio's play this all day every day
Recognize I'm a fool and you lovin' me
None of you, nuh, better look at me funny
Nuh, you know my name now give me my money.

CHROUS x2

Sing it
Sing it girls...
Just shake it right now!
If Dirty want his money I think y'all should give him his money
That's how I like girl
Sexy, sexy, sexy,
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy, sexy.

Yo, yo, nigga playin' in the club like this all night
Bitches put your ass out and let me hold it tight
You lookin' at my wrist sayin' "It's so nice!"
The price fits the diamonds, shinin' in disco lights
You better help me solve my problem
Or I'm a get this money and rob them
Lucky dog when I won the lotto
Ran up my cards for carryin' raw loads
Well hold on now you can call me Dirty
And then lift up your skirt
And if you want some of this dirty
God made dirt and dirt bust your ass
Stop annoying me, yeah I play my music loud
Take the bastard Old Dirty to move the crowd
They said he had his dick in his mouth
Eddie Murphy taught me that back at the house
Now give me my money.

CHORUS repeats fading out
