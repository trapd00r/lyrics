'The Rap Game'
Hip-hop 1-0-1
The hardest 9 to 5 you will ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history-book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul...
gheh-gheh-gheh 
'The Rap Game'
Motherfucker

(Swifty) 
I'm a disruptive nigger
You made me crazy
You should a slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me drunk of sober
You'll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop your ass
Your neck will get snapped wit bear hands, fuck music
Is he rappin' is cool but fool don't confuse it
What happens these dudes get rude and then I lose it?
I'm scandals
I blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger
Then Godzilla's back nigga
You are not real and in fact
Your fruity effect of a crack dealer
Y'all president sends me smack
Den got a mack 10 with it
So I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that
Don't mistaken me black
Or you be stankin' in back of a fuckin' Cadillac

(Eminem) 
I'ma get snuffed
Cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the White House is whipped out
When I see that 'lil Cheany dike get snipped out
Lights out, bitch, adios, goodnight
Now put that in your 'lil pipe and bite down
Think for a minute cause the hype has died down
That I won't go up in the oval office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Doloris Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker, duck, what the fuck, son of a bitch
Take away my gun and I'm a tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switch blade with a 'lil switch to switch blades
Switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade
Shits like a samurai sword, a sensei
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way still
'Til I utslay itchbay
Ucksay my ickday
'Scuse my igpay atinlay
But uckfay a igpay

(Kon Artis) 
I bet you rather me
Drink and drown in my own iniquity
But fuck that, I'ma rap 'til you all get sick of me
And clutch my nut sack and spit on who pick on me
I'm hittin' a rock next, fuck a dogg who sickin' me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know and quit playin'
If I'm broke then I'm brakin' open the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived it, that's why I speak on what I want when I write
So why... should I... ever fear another man
If he bleed like I, bleed, take a piss and he stand
Ok, you win... you can say we can't rap
But no source never mean we ain't buyin' on what they say is wack

(Kuniva)
I walk in the party and just start bustin'
Right after I hear the last verse, I'm self-destruction
This liquor make me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Day and Jerome
I'm low down and shifty, quickly, called Swifty
To do a drive by on a 10-speed with "50"
You feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chucky Cheese
Well, just see, who be an unlucky G
My life style is unstable, a partyin' attic
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a matic
Coughin' ecstatic, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Popin' a tablet, and guns that saw you in half

(50 Cent)
Believe me
We run this rap shit fo shizzie
Make makin' millions look easy
Every where ya turn you see me
You hear me
Believe me
For ya see my pistol in 3-D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 9-1-1 cause you need de
Police to help you, believe me

(Proof)
I snatch the tongue from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd
These street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Cause Proof and Shaun
Share nuttin' in common
The nastiest band
With gats in each hand
We never bomb down to be a flash and a pan
No remorse
Fuck you stature, dogg
Nuttin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground
With the 4 and a pound
I'm goin' out of town
For the long come around
So we can battle with raps
So we can battle with gats
Matter fact, we can battle with plaques

(Bizarre)
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Loraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument
Who was the largest
Now they all is dead
And I'm rollin' as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well, I really didn't
But I did accordin' to this contract
I was stoned in the snow
With no where to go
Freezin' 20 below
Forced to join bail tip Dafoe
My little girl, she shouldn't be listenin' to these lyrics
That's why I glued the headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks (hahhaha)
50, sing the hook
