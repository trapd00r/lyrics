Whatsoever I feared has come to life
Whatsoever I fought off became my life
Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded and now I'm doing time
Now I'm doing time

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

Whomsoever I cured, I've sickened now
Whomsoever I cradled, I've put you down
Search my soul, they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking when I get it right
When I get it right

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?

So what you wanted to see good has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours, you've made it mine
So don't you lock up something that you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking, no, not tying
No, not tying

I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Yeah, I sure don't mind
I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change

But I fell on black days
I fell on black days

How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
I sure don't mind a change
