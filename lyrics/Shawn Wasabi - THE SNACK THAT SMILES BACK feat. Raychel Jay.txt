I know you been lookin' at me lookin' at you
Lookin' at you, aw yeah
Cravin' you, like, all afternoon
Someday, I'll be gettin' a taste

Just take me out and break me in half
Ooh, the snack that smiles back

You belong there like the frosting on a cinnamon bun
A cinnamon bun, aw yeah
I'ma eat it 'til it's makin' me yum, aw yeah
Split me like an Oreo and dip me in a cup of your joe
'Cause neither one of us is gonna taste as good if we're on our own
Fallin' like a Skittle, I'll be fillin' up the palm of your hand
I'll be skinny dippin', feelin' dizzy from your butter pecan

I'm gonna be the snack that smiles back

Ooh, the snack that smiles back
Ooh, the Kit to your Kat

I'm gonna be the snack that smiles back
I'm gonna be the Kit to your Kat
Ooh, the snack that smiles back

I'm gonna be the one you unwrap
Just take me out and break me in half
Ooh, the snack that smiles back
