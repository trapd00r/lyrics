All your friends in the back seat, they gone crazy
Trying to find where the big bad wolf belongs
Yeah we messed it up pretty good, this time girl we can work it out
Oh, the things we should have done

Stop calling on the bloodhounds
They're just as lost as me and you
Stop calling me on a bad hand
When you know I'm gonna lose

Yeah I'm learning how to breathe again dear
Scratching around in the junk yard for my love again
Spinning round on that old carousel
The dog's digging up his bone

Stop calling on the bloodhounds
They're just as lost as me and you
Stop calling me on a bad hand
When you know I'm gonna lose
When you know I'm gonna lose
When you know I'm gonna lose

The bloodhound
The bloodhound
The bloodhound
