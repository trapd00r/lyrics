Wishin' and Hopin' and thinkin' and prayin'
Plannin' and dreamin' each night of his charms
That won't get you into his arms
So if you're looking to find love you can share
All you gotta do is hold him
And kiss him and love him
And show him that you care

Show him that you care just for him
Do the things he likes to do
Wear your hair just for him
Girl, you won't get him wishin' and a-hopin'
Thinkin' and a-prayin'
Just wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin'
Plannin' and dreamin' his kisses will start
That won't get you into his heart
So if you're thinkin' of havin' true lovin'
All you've gotta do is hold him and kiss him
And squeeze him and love him
Do it, and after you do you will be his
