Nothing, nothing
Nothing I like better
Together, now together
Nothing I like better

Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer

Sometimes
This feels so right
I'm losin' my mind
I wish that we could stop
And stop time
Then we could be together
All night
There's nothing I like better

Getting closer (Closer)
Closer (Closer)

Closer, closer, closer, closer
Closer, closer

Nothing, nothing
Nothing I like better
Together, now together
Nothing I like better

Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer

Somehow
I stop myself from cryin'
Out loud
When I'm with you
'Cause I'm so proud
To be your only lover
And now
There's nothing I like better

Getting closer (Closer)
Closer (Closer)
Closer (Closer)
Closer (Closer)
