I get the feeling that it's gone and it's the reason that I 
Feel so dark now [Gotta gotta gotta take control] 
Too much inside, too much in life 
Define your point of view [Gotta gotta gotta take control]

[Looks like IT] found a way to reach my heart 
Take it all back to the start of this 
A million miles from home

Feel so dark now [Gotta gotta gotta take control] 
Too much inside, too much in life 
Define your point of view [Gotta gotta gotta take control] 
Are you still leaving, maybe you should start believing, but still 
You don't see it [Gotta gotta gotta take control] 

Gone, once you shone, I move on 
Though I still find time to hide 
It's all burried deep inside, so it 
[Looks like IT] found a way to reach my heart 
Take it all back to the start of this 
A million miles from home
