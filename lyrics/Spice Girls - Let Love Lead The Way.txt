What makes this world go round?
Will the answer let her down?
She is so sweet and young
And her life has just begun

Victoria:
What does her future hold?
That's a story left unknown

Emma:
Will she make it through her days?
Let our Love lead the way

All:
Part of me laughs (Melanie C: ooh)
Part of me cries
Part of me wants to question why (Melanie C: Question why)
Why is there joy?
Why is there pain?
Why is there sunshine and the rain?
One day you're here
Next you are gone
No matter what we must go on
Just keep the faith and
Let Love Lead the Way
Melanie C:
Everything will work out fine
If you let love

Sitting there all alone
In the window of her room
Watching the world go by
Brings tears to her eyes

All she sees is hurt and pain
She wants to brake the chain

She'll keep pressing every day
And she'll find her own sweet way

Why is there pain? (Emma: So much pain)
Why is there sunshine and the rain? (Emma: Why is there sunshine then the rain)
One day you're here (Emma: You're here)
Next day you're gone (Emma: You're gone)
No matter what we must go on (Emma: I will go on)
Just keep the faith and (Emma: Keep your faith)
Let Love lead the way

I know I know I know I know

Melanie C:
You can be all that
And still can be who you are
You've got to know for sure
That it isn't make believe

All:
You may feel weak
But you are strong
Don't you give up, girl

Emma:
If you keep holding on
You'll never be wrong
Just close you're eyes
'Cause it lies deep in your heart, Yeah
