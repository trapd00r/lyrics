Clue/Mariah: 
 
 Yeah 
 (We're gonna do it like this, ooh) 
 
 Jay-Z/Mariah: 
 
 All right let's go (ooh) 
 
 Mariah: 
 
 Give me your love x 16
  
 
 Jay-Z/Clue: 
 
 Uh, what, uh, jigga (MC, ha, Clue) 
 Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this 
 You almost gotta watch to this, uh-huh (who-ee) 
 Escape 
 
 Mariah: 
 
 Ooh your love's so good 
 I don't wanna let go 
 And although I should 
 I can't leave you alone (ha, ha) 
 Cause you're so disarming 
 I'm caught up in the midst 
 Of you, and I can not resist, (sing the song) oh 
 
 Mariah:
 
 Boy if I do 
 The things you want me to 
 The way I used to do 
 Would you love me baby? 
 Holding me, feeling me, would you go and break my heart?
 
 Chorus:
 
 Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
 But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
 Oh why did you have to run your game on me? 
 I should have known right from the start 
 You'd go and break my heart
 
 Mariah/Clue:
 
 [Mariah] (Jay Z) 
 Give me your love 
 Give me your love (She said) 
 Give me your love (She wants) 
 Give me your love 
 Give me your love (She said) 
 Give me your love (Uh-huh) 
 Give me your love (Yeah) 
 Give me your love 
  
 (Get him back) 
 It's a shame to be 
 So euphoric and weak 
 When you smile at me 
 And you tell me the things 
 That you know just maybe could relinquish my love to you 
 But I can not resist (ha, ha) oh no
 
 Mariah:
 
 Boy if I do 
 The things you want me to 
 The way I used to do 
 Would you love me baby? 
 Holding me, feeling me, would you go and break my heart?
 
 Chorus:
 
 Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
 But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
 Oh why did you have to run your game on me? 
 I should have known right from the start 
 You'd go and break my heart
 Jay-Z: 
 
 I'm all on the record 
 Okay, Clue all right 
 She wanna shop with Jay 
 She wanna play box with Jay 
 She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night 
 She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends 
 She wanna creep past the block, spying again 
 She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away 
 She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date 
 She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb 
 If she find one strand of hair longer than hers 
 She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies 
 Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie 
 She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm 
 That's when I gotta send her back to her mom 
 She calls me heartbreaker, when we apart it makes her 
 Want a piece of paper, scribble down "I Hate Ya" 
 But she knows she loves Jay because 
 Cause she loves everything Jay say, Jay does and uh
 
 Chorus:
 
 Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
 But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
 Oh why did you have to run your game on me? 
 I should have known right from the start 
 You'd go and break my heart
 
 Heartbreaker you've got the best of me 
 But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
 Oh why did you have to run your game on me? 
 I should have known right from the start 
 You'd go and break my heart
  
 Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
 (Boy if I do)      
 But I just keep on coming back incessantly
 (The things you want me to, the way I used to do)  
 Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
 (Would you love me baby) 
 I should have known right from the start
 (Holding me, feeling me) 
 You'd go and break my heart
 (Would you go and break me heart)
