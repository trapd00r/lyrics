All the pictures on the wall
The sand lying on the floor
The bed upstairs still unmade
The dust float in the light
The people just left
All laughter and mess
Forgetting this and that
And rushing back
The front door open
The music still playing in one room
Down the hall
Towels on the floor
And then it's quiet
Just the bees and birds
The summer haze
Of the trees
And the air
Feeds it all
Feeds it all

We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
The day before we went to war

All the parasols and kids at play
The sea so still and calm
Blue as the cloudless sky
Just the gentle hum
Of the summer's goings on
Broken by the sudden rush
Of two planes
Flying low and fast
Into the sun
Into the sun

We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
We can all feel it
Like a light hand on your back
Welcoming you
The day before we went to war.
