Chuggin' on our 40s and holdin' up.44s

You just another punk in the club about to get jumped
I settle my vendettas with AK's, Berettas
We don't 'posed to be in here with our weapons, but still they let us
Switchblade, brass knuckles, nickel plated belt buckle
Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble
Elbows flyin', bitches cryin', niggas bleedin', you retreatin'
Run into your car and skatin' off, we G'ing
We make example out of you haters runnin' your mouth
You the reason why your peoples is pourin' they 40s out
Dirty Dozen wildin', beat niggas bloodied
And you gon' have to pour out a keg for all your homies

I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk
80 Proof on this vodka, that's the name I want
I'm in the club to beef, you gotta murder me dead
Only talk to a bitch with burgundy hair
Or the aisle in the 'Vette, bumpin' Seven-Deuce
See that top on that 40, you know it's comin' loose
See me on the ave daily, be runnin' this shit
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch
Packin' mags and clips, I'll smash your clique
Because of Proof they put the "G" in the alphabet
Smokin' weed, drinkin' Henny, Remy, and that Jimmy
Don't worry if we run out, the corner store got plenty

Pour your 40 out (Guzzle it)
Pour your 40 out (Guzzle it)
Pour your 40 out (Guzzle it)
Pour your 40 out (Guzzle it)
Pour your 40 out (Guzzle it)
