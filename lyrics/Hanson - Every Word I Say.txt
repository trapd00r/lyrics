You feel like liberation 
You give me new sensation 
You show me what I need and
You are my life completed 

Can't stop, can't break, who's driving?
Sometimes there's no denying 
'Til today I feel I can't lose 
I'm letting go of what I knew 

I want you for always 
I hear your name in every word I say 
I'm a fool and I don't care 
I hear your name in every word I say 
Every word I say
Every word I say

Before you I was only 
What I let control me 
You are a revolution 
Against my own conclusions
So today I feel I can't lose 
But I'm letting go of what I knew 

Said, I want you for always 
I hear your name in every word I say 
I'm a fool and I don't care 
I hear your name in every word I say 
Oh no no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no

And now I say goodbye to the way I used to be 
There is no room for question 
'Cause your name, it sets me free 
Yesterday's troubles harm me 
T-Today's are creeping in
So let go of the world around me
'Cause your love is all I need 

I want you for always 
I hear your name in every word I say 
I'm a fool and that's okay
I hear your name in every word I say 

I want you for always 
I hear your name in every word I say 
I'm a fool and I don't care 
I hear your name in every word I say 

Every word I say 
Every word I say 
In every word I say
Oh no no no no no no no 
Oh no no no no no 
Oh no no no no no no no no no no
Yeah!

I hear your name in every word I say 
I hear your name in every word I say 
I hear your name in every word I say 
I hear your name well all I hear is your name 
All I hear is your name 
All I hear is your name
And no one can take it away
