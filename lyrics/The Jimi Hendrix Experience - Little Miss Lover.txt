Little Miss Lover, where have you
been in this world for so long
Well I love a lover who feels
like you, would you like to tag along

Well I really don't need any help little girl
But I think you can help me out anyway
Aaah, sock it to me

Would you believe, baby, I've been lookin' 
for a Sue that feels like you for some time
Excuse me while I see if the Gypsy in me
is right if you don't mind

Well he signals me okay so I think it's
safe to say that I'm gonna make a play
Aaaah yea

Hey!  Little Miss Lover
Well there's so much you and me can discover
Hey!  Little Miss Lover
Hey!  Little Miss Lover
Hey!  Little Miss Lover...
