As soon as you're born they make you feel small
Givin' you no time 'sted of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they dispise a fool
You're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

When they tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
But you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

They keep you doped with religion, and sex and T.V.
You think you're so clever and class-less and free
You're still fucking peasents as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top they are tellin' you still
First you must learn how to smile as you kill
You wanna be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

You wanna be a hero then just follow me
You wanna be a hero then just follow me
