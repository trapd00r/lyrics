Well he's a big star now
But I've been a fan of his for years
The way he sings and plays guitar
Still brings me to tears

I wouldn't want to be a big deal
I wouldn't want to be a celebrity
I spend my life building ships of steel
That's all there ever was for me

Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
And I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame

He spends his life in the studio
Jet planes and big black cars
Plays records on the radio
In all of the clubs and in all of the bars

By day he didn't have a choice
You had to take a trade
You had no money and you had no voice
That's the life I made

Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
And I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame

That's my claim to fame boys
That's my claim to fame
To sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame

Well a song can live forever and a day
An old ship goes to the breakers yard
In a hundred years you're gonna hear him play
They won't remember me for working hard

Now they've all gone away, all the boys and the girls
They yard is a grave where the river runs through
We used to build the ships for the whole wide world
Now we couldn't do it if we wanted to

Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame

Take a hammer to the sea belles
And shout my name
I'll sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame

That's my claim to fame boys
That's my claim to fame
To sail the seas as free as a breeze
That's my claim to fame
