[Verse 1:]
My bank got bigger, the kid got richer
Multi-millionaire but I'm the same old nigga
Never find a nigga with a watch more sicker
Or rub a nigga spit this game mo slicker
That's yo tender after I hit er
Heard that she broke up with yo own Twitter
I never saw her get to a face turn bitter
Take pity off but I can't get with er
Use a band for a bed, use a brick for a pillow
Bag on yo head, best friend turned killa
Ridin in the foreign, steel wheel in the middle
Car check a Benz bet to reconsider
Diamonds on my wrist, I'm a hand it out the window
Presidential endo, smell it when the wind blow
4's on my Charger, I drive it like an Enzo
When bricks touch down I'll be dancing in the end zone
6 months gone, would've thought I would've been home
Keep the bottom with me like my last name Flintstone
Never do respect the street shit that I pimp on
Fully turnt up, now yo ass got a limp on
Slugs came in and they move it beneath to
Went up on the kid then yo ass is finite
Easy to me, shoot yo ass like a free throw
2 Glock 9's on the piko

[Hook:]
This pack ride up, strong as any time
DVA diamond cost a couple thou
Checker boy get hard Louie down
Always showin up when we be steppin out
It's tech higher, at it for a while
How much we spending on it? Over thou
We pull up in them foreigns, I'm smashing out
Then spend a grip in Philps, bitch I'm cashing out

[Verse 2:]
20 place, 20 days, 40K in diamonds
Shorty got her shades on, still see me shinin
Pat touched down, I'm a bust it down asap
Rocket ass rich so you know I gotta stay strapped
Always stand Louie bitch like at ho sales
Swerve around to the trap, tell em throw an O on the scale
I'm international
Old school Chevelle, I'm skatin now all national
You's the type a nigga love a bitch and take er to your place
I'm the type of nigga wake up in the morning 100K
Turn it up, Louie sneakers on it, you should see the lace
Those that cost a couple K, I just got this shit yesterday

[Hook: x2]
This pack ride up, strong as any time
DVA diamond cost a couple thou
Checker boy get hard Louie down
Always showin up when we be steppin out
It's tech higher, at it for a while
How much we spending on it? Over thou
We pull up in them foreigns, I'm smashing out
Then spend a grip in Philps, bitch I'm cashing out
