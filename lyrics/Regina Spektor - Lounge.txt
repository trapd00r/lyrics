I don't care that flowers grow for you,
And me, and me
You don't know what love is till you see,
Her standing there
A web of skin and nails and hair
A web of skin and nails and hair
And bones and bones,
And thoughts
Rush in, and out your head
You think you are alive, but you are dead
You keep, on driving in your car asleep
I'm driving in your car
I don't know why flowers grow in winter time
The sky turns gray the sun don't shine
And people rush to be on time for work,
They wrap them selves in woolen cloaks
And hats and scarves
Like larva in their incubators
And drive and drive
(Noises)
And drive and drive and drive
Until they get away
