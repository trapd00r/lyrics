(Little Girl's voice:)
He was once a thug from around the way
Easy! But you should...

(Eazy E interrupts:)
Bitch shut the fuck up! Get the fuck out of here! Yo Dre

(Dr. Dre:)
"What's up?"

(Eazy E:)
Give me a funky ass bass line

What the fuck is up?
In the place to be
Comin' on the mic is Eazy muthafuckin' E
Dre is on the beat
Yella's on the cut
So listen right close while we rip shit up

(Eazy E:)
Well I'm Eazy E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group comin' out to shoot
Eazy E, muthafuckers cold knockin' the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard Compton, you think I own a drugstore
Gettin' stupid because I know how
And if a fucker talks shit, I give him a... (POW)
8 Ball sippin' the bitches are flippin'
Slow down, I hit a dippin' continue my trippin'
Hittin' my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feelin' good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homey like Dre just supplying the beats

Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It

I was knocking muthafukers out
What's your name boy
Funky, fresh Eazy E
Kick, kick that shit
Where you from fool? Compton, yeah

Rolling through the hood, cold tearin' shit up
Stick my head out the window & I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumpin' the box
But you know that's an alibi for slangin' the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jockin' 24-7
Rolled them muthafukers ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a 10 a fo'
Was takin' niggas money and was itchin' for mo'
Laughin' in their faces and said your all making me rich
Then one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold broke his ass

Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It

Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it?
Muthafuckin' Eazy Duz It
But how does he do it?
Eazy Duz It do it eazy
That's what I'm doin'
Stop
Man whatcha gonna do now

Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucker
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starvin' 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of 9
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the gankin' zone
All the things I did for her like keepin' her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the hoe

Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun
Never leave the pad without packin' a gun
Hittin' hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy Duz It

From around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy E
It's '88 now, '73's obselete
A nigga wit a serious ass attitude and 100% street
And if you all wanna hear some more
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother
Word to the muthafucker
