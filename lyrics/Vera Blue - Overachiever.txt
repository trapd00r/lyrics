You get it too easy
Which makes me think twice before I start believing
I hear from you only at night
I see right through, that's why it might
Make me think twice
Makes me think twice
 
Just for a moment
I have no excuse
I always knew it
I will never deny you
I will never deny you
I will never deny you
 
I barely even noticed
It seems like you're in and out of my focus
Am I into you?
The words you say, oh, just what you do
The things you make me feel nice
He's on my mind

Just for a moment
I have no excuse
I always knew it
I will never deny you
I will never deny you
I will never deny you
 
It's a little hard to believe ya
When you're an overachiever
I can't help but let you get away
It's a little hard to believe ya
When you're an overachiever
I can't help but let you get away
It's a little hard to believe ya
When you're an overachiever
I can't help but let you get away
It's a little hard to believe ya
When you're an overachiever
I will never, never
I will never deny you
I will never deny you
