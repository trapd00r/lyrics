Do you really think that you're lost?
And that you'll never find the way
Learn the secrets of the woods
See the picture if you could
You grow a little every day
And now I'm grown and I look like you
Who'd ever know - how I turned out
But, I'm grown, and I look like you
I look like someone I never knew...

Speak while your lips are trembling
Talk to me when I'm listening
Finally someone said something good

We grow a little every day
And now I'm grown and I look like you
Like a voice that fills out the room
How do you know when you've grown up?
When you tie yourself down and give yourself up.

Speak while your lips are trembling
Talk to me when I'm listening
Finally someone said something good
Because we're leaving nothing
But moments of belonging
Finally someone said something good
Finally someone said something good
In the end someone says something good...
