(l. stansfield/i. devaney/a. morris)

You need money like you've got no soul
Can't love ever fill that hole
You talk fast but your heart is slow
Can't love ever make you whole

Your laughing at my words right now
But you'll end up a tired and lonely man
You tell me love is nothing but wasted time
Well I'm telling you it's the only way of life

Chorus:
I can't see enjoyment
I don't see compassion
I see symptoms of loneliness and heartache
I don't see emotion or quality of life
Just symptoms of loneliness and heartache

I can't figure out the love we share
I can't see that there's any there at all
You buy me flowers and fancy things
But I need your heart above everything

Your laughing at my words right now
But you'll end up a tired and lonely man
You tell me love is nothing but wasted time
Well I'm telling you it's the only way of life

Chorus x 2

Your laughing at my words right now
But you'll end up a tired and lonely man
You tell me love is nothing but wasted time
Well I'm telling you it's the only way of life
