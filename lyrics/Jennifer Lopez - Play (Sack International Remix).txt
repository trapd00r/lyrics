I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the D.J.
'Cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

Chorus:
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on D.J. play that song
You know that it turns me on
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on

D.J. just play that song
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long
Won't you play my play my play my play my
Play my favorite song

I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up, 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long
It feels so right that it can't be wrong
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind
Play that shit again
Let me hear it one more time

Chorus:
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on D.J. play that song
You know that it turns me on
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on

Now Mr. D.J.
I've asked you 3 times
Play my muthafuckin' song.

I just wanna dance
Is that a crime?
Alright then, ooh, uh
Come here baby, ooh, uh
I just wanna dance

Chorus(x3):
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on D.J. play that song
You know that it turns me on
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn me on

'Cause I wanna be dancin'
'Cause I wanna be dancin'
'Cause I wanna be dancin'
'Cause I wanna be dancin' all night long

D.J. just play that song
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn it on
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it up and turn it on on
D.J. just play that song
Just turn it on
All night long
Just play that song
All night long

yeah, that's the hotness right there.
