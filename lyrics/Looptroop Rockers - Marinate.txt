Feels like they're working against us sometimes
Dark clouds when we needed sunshine
But really, who are they and why would they mind
Us making a living and getting a little shine
They're just too lazy to do what they're supposed to
And we're pushing to pursue our goals. You
Know what they're saying if we need something done
We need to do it ourselves, stay strong in the long run

I been workin' all week, still up on my feet
Can't complain, I'mma carry the weight
Cannot let the negative vibes ever limit my life
We press play and get carried away
I take the good things in and the bad things too
Soak it up, let it marinate
Baby let it all out if you ready, roll out and get up for the Saturday

I gotta grin and bear it, count to ten, get on with my life again
Can't break my spirit, confident I got what it takes, I'm competent
Won't take no no for no answer I'm out to get it done
That's how we got here, how we're leaving, how the troopers run
I hear you yapping and bragging about what's 'bout to happen
That's insecurity talking, we more about the action
We all about the passion, your shit is fuel for the fire
Should be happy to cash in, sounding truthfully tired
Yup, man, I'm tired and a motherfucker
No new deal, they ain't signing a motherfucker
Got my own label and I'm proud of that motherfucker (DVSG)
But I'd be lying like a motherfucker
If I told you my business's on lock and I piss in a pot of gold
Living that rock'n'roll lifestyle
I wish I'd sell what Tupac has sold
But making my pocket swoll's looking impossible right now
So I bottle my rage 'till I get up on stage so I can keep that edge and cut through the bull
Looptroop Rockers ablaze, straight shock and amaze, party people in the place looking beautiful

I been workin' all week, still up on my feet
Can't complain, I'mma carry the weight
Cannot let the negative vibes ever limit my life
We press play and get carried away
I take the good things in and the bad things too
Soak it up, let it marinate
Baby let it all out if you ready, roll out and get up for the Saturday

I get up up 'fore the break of day
Everyday just to make my pay
When I'm done I wanna celebrate
Feel like my work is vacation sometimes
We get some time off from the frontline
Get to sign off early, unwind
On a Saturday, it don't matter day
On a Saturday, it don't matter day
On a Saturday, it don't matter day
On a Saturday, it don't matter, ey

I been workin' all week, still up on my feet
Can't complain, I'mma carry the weight
Cannot let the negative vibes ever limit my life
We press play and get carried away
I take the good things in and the bad things too
Soak it up, let it marinate
Baby let it all out if you ready, roll out and get up for the Saturday

I been workin' all week, still up on my feet
Can't complain, I'mma carry the weight
Cannot let the negative vibes ever limit my life
We press play and get carried away
I take the good things in and the bad things too
Soak it up, let it marinate
Baby let it all out if you ready, roll out and get up for the Saturday

I get up up 'fore the break of day
Everyday just to make my pay
When I'm done I wanna celebrate
When I'm done I wanna celebrate
