Underneath your dreamlit eyes
Shades of sleep have driven you away.
The moon is pale outside
And you are far from here

Breathing shifts your careless head
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives
Another day, another night
Has taken you again my dear

And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there
When you need someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes

Last night while you were lying in my arms
I was wondering where you were
You know you looked just like a baby
Fast asleep in this dangerous world

Every star was shining brightly
Like a million years before
We were feeling very small
Underneath the universe

And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there
When you need someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes

And you know that I'm gonna be the one
Who'll be there
When you need someone to depend upon
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
Wait 'til tomorrow comes
