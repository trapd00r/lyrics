Come on lets go down
Everybodys waiting for us
Down at the ghost town
Bill Bailey said he'd be around
If Mrs. G. Robinson would just put
That bad Havana down

Lovely Queen Anne Boleyn
Learning new tricks from the Great Houdini Wo Wo
Now thats the way she's gonna make it Wo Wo

Come on
Come on lets go down
Everybody's waiting for us
Down at the boom town
O. Redding & Washington
Chico and Harpo and Karl are
In the Kitchen with mum

Buster Keaton and King Tut
Are waiting for Disney to wake up Wo Wo
Now that's the way
No that ain't the way he's gonna make it
