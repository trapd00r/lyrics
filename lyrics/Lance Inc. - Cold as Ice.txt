Ice
Love is written in your eyes
I can feel it once and twice
To hold you is my only advice
But your heart is cold as ice
At least I wanna hear good byes
So please never tell me lies
To hold you is my only advice
But your heart is cold as ice
Love is written in your eyes
I can feel it once and twice
To hold you is my only advice
But your heart is cold as ice
Love is written in your eyes
I can feel it once and twice
To hold you is my only advice

Ice
