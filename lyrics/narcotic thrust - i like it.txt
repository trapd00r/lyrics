I hate the treadmill everyday
I hate the mundane things they say
The boredom sets in 9 to 5
At night that's when I come alive

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
The bright lights beckon me
Beckon me to you

I like it when we go to extremes
I like it when you enter my dreams
I like it when I feel your touch
I like it... I like it so much
I like it when we're one on one
I like it when we come undone
I like it when we go to extremes
You let me, let me live my dreams

There must be more to life than this
This life I surely will not miss
To spend my time waiting in line
In search for something the grand design

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
The bright lights beckon me
Beckon me to you

Oh oh oh

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
The bright lights beckon me
Beckon me to you

I like it so much
Oh oh oh
I like it so much
Oh oh oh
I like it so much
I like it, I like it so much
So much so much
I like it so much
