(Everybody)
(Everybody's looking for something)

I'm ferocious, when I see you instantly
So precocious, assuming that you're into me
So fierce the way you pierce me with your energy
My heart's on fire, boy come on and rescue me

When I see you, I need you right away (take on me)
Can't control the way that I am behaving
It's got a hold on me, grabbing me, rapidly
Romantic dancing, dreams are made of this, yeah

Everybody
Come on get to jumping
Everybody
Moving next to something
Everybody
Feel the temperature rising
Everybody
Come on let's keep grinding

It's so real to feel you standing next to me
So intense when you're sensing my vicinity
Body shaking, aching, I can take it how
I want you so bad, boy that I can taste it now

When I see you I need you right away (take on me)
Can't control the way that I am behaving
It's got a hold on me, grabbing me, rapidly
Romantic dancing, dreams are made of this, yeah

Everybody
Come on get to jumping
Everybody
Moving next to something
Everybody
Feel the temperature rising
Everybody
Come on let's keep grinding

Fellas get wild, start flashing your money
Ladies go crazy and act a fool
Everybody get down and do what you want to
The night is still young to be seduced

Taking in with every little thing I see
Triple table dancing with the tab complete
Little boys dancing 'cause they feeling me
Sweating cold, fretting, it's the place to be
Come and sit with me, come and sit with me
Sit back, you'll see it so beautifully
Loving everybody, babe, is all you need
Let go of the way things used to be

Everybody
Come on get to jumping (everybody)
Everybody
Moving next to something (move your body)
Everybody
Feel the temperature rising (oh)
Everybody
Come on let's keep grinding

Everybody (let your body move, oh)
Come on get to jumping
Everybody
Moving next to something
Everybody
Feel the temperature rising
Everybody
Come on let's keep griding

(Everybody)
Everybody
(Everybody's looking for something, everybody)
Everybody
