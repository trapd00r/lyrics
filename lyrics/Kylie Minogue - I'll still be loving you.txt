I'm seeing it your way
But I don't believe it's true that
I'm not the one to make you happy
It would be so wrong for us to break in two
But do what you gotta do

I hope you find someone 
Who can love you like I do
I'll be strong inside
But I'll still be loving you

But I'll still be loving you

Since the day that I found you
I built my dreams all around you and I
Believed you would never leave me
So sure it was love forever more
But if you walk out the door

I hope you find someone 
Who can love you like I do
I'll be strong inside
But I'll still be loving you

You say the magic has gone forever
But deep down inside I don't believe it's so
But I'm letting you go

I hope you find someone 
Who can love you like I do
I'll be strong inside
But I'll still be loving you
