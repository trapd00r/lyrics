Lightning shot from the sky
It breathed life into every, every living thing
It made you, it made me
It gave us the Kookaburra, it gave us Frangipane tree

From dusk to dawn and dawn to dusk
The sky will fill with vaporized dust, raining
White on white, like streamers of dirty confetti
White on white, the Chrysler Tower had disappeared
White on white, the capitol dome was invisible
White on white, the hoisted flag had disappeared

It can't be stopped
Thunder clouds are tightening in the sky tonight
We can't be saved
Electricity will scribble out your name

Lightning shot from the sky
It gives, it takes away from every living thing
It made you, it made me
It gave us the terrabyte, it gave us 117

From dusk to dawn and dawn to dusk
The sky will fill with vaporized dust, raining
White on white, like streamers of dirty confetti
White on white, the looming spire had disappeared
White on white, the Bundestag was invisible
White on white, the hoisted flag had disappeared

White phosphor rain
And blackout bombs are falling out the sky tonight
We can't be saved
Electricity is crossing out your family name

It made you, it made me
It gave us the Kookaburra, it gave us
Frangipane tree
