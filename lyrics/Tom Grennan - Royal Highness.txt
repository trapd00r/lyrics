Come be my lover, be my get away car
Come be the new string on my broken guitar
Be the person, gotta take it that one step too far, whoa

All this time I've been clocking your eyes
I've been thinking you've got everything I like
You're acting like you wanna show if I'm right
If you're feeling what I'm feeling

You'll be my royal highness
Queen bee, with a little sting to ya
You'll be my royal highness
My lady, with a little freak to ya
You'll be my, you'll be my royal highness
You'll be my, you'll be my royal highness, royal highness

Be my temple, be the start of a fire
Be the one that's not my usual type
Let me see you're not a trick of the light
Don't be shy, whoa

All this time I've been clocking your eyes
I've been thinking you've got everything I like
You're acting like you wanna show me if I'm right
If you're feeling what I'm feeling

You'll be my royal highness
Queen bee, with a little sting to ya
You'll be my royal highness
My lady, with a little freak to ya
You'll be my, you'll be my royal highness
You'll be my, you'll be my royal highness, royal highness

(It will come along without you knowing, it's like finding)
A needle in a haystack
(It will come along without you knowing, it's like finding)
A needle in a haystack
(It will come along without you knowing, it's like finding)
A needle in a haystack
(It will come along without you knowing, it's like finding)
A needle in a haystack

You'll be my royal highness
Queen bee, with a little sting to ya
You'll be my royal highness
My lady, with a little freak to ya
You'll be my, you'll be my royal highness
You'll be my, you'll be my royal highness, royal highness

(Without you knowing, without you knowing it's like finding)
A needle in haystack
(When I come along without you knowing, it's like finding)
Royal Highness
