Empire Strikes Black (4:52 - 9:21)

We comin' through to take control of each zip code
Bridgin' the Gap from rap to calypso
We gonna strike each city from 'Frisco
Tokyo to back to San Luis Obispo
As in data, descendants of Amadeus.
(Transmitted through your CD's) Tapes & record players
We the crusaders, attack like alligators
Yo, we're known to elevate like escalators
Yo, we comin' through to control your area
Black Eyed Peas control your area
Bringin' the vibe that create hysteria
Wack MC's (vacate your area)
We 3 deep, comin' out of yo' speaker
I'm bustin' your woofer & tearin' through your tweeter
Every rapper's talkin' 'about killin' somebody
But they ain't hip-hop to me, check it out.

This is the hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin' non non stop
{*scratch "Black Eyed Peas"*} Yo, we keep it movin'
{*scratch*} Yo, we keep it movin'
The hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin' non non stop
{*scratch "Black Eyed Peas"*} Yo, we keep it movin'
{*scratch*} We got to keep it movin'.

It's the Black Eyed Peas yo climbin' up the Empire
State tower livin' is the mission desired
I see alot of liars so to dem I cross & fire
& they lyrics soundin' tired, repetitious & expired
(Cool dem down troop) before they time get picked
I can't take 'em serious talkin' about bullshit
Got money & cars but can't bullshit
& your lyrics are soundin' like some doo doo shit
While I'm holdin' the mic tight, recite livin' insight
So we can all benefit from the artform
?? took ?? you to make dough
But forgot the main goal, almost lost the soul & got norm
'Cause everybody's talkin' 'about, high profilin'
But it ain't hip-hop to me, why why why
'Cause everybody's talkin' 'about, high profilin'
But it ain't hip-hop to me, so check it out y'all.

This is the hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin' non non stop
{*scratch "Black Eyed Peas"*} We keep it movin'
{*scratch*} Yo (we keep it movin')
The hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin, non non stop
(Black Eyed Peas) Yo, we keep it movin'
{*scratch*} We got to keep it movin'.

Yeah, your style's dated & you ain't came out yet
Don't think your +fresh+ 'cause your rockin' them outfits
I think your lost 'cause you don't know where your route is
Pick up the mic, put your money where your mouth is.

I pick up the mic & put my lyrics where my mouth is
Hit your spirit, make you jump out them couches
Quick agility to slow-like slouches
With more bounce to the freak of def ounces.

& we announce this, follow us to show you what the sound is
Primo & the Peas collaboratin' like great
Aiyyo let's do this, let's do this, we show you who the crew is
Black Eyed Peas is like the rulers leavin' all you brothers clueless
Haters hate us if you wanna, we gon' speak on it
We gon' tell the world why hip-hop is haunted
Funny is a trug & MC's is on it
We gon' take it back to the days of Soulsonic.

This is the hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin' non non stop
{*scratch "Black Eyed Peas"*} Yo, we keep it movin'
{*scratch*} We got to keep it movin'
The hip hip hip, the hop hop hop
We keep it keep it movin' non non stop
{*scratch "Black Eyed Peas"*} Yo, we keep it movin'
{*scratch*} We got to keep it movin'.
