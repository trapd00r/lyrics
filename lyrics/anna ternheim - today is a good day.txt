Call me free today
If you see it my way
Time on my side
As well as my mind is

It's not with you for sure
No, not anymore
I intend to stay away for good

Just a matter how I define
My state of mind
Today is a good day
Today is a good day

Without your company
I have so many holes to fill
At least seven nights a week
Killing time

I still feel fine, I guess
My life was a mess
When i shared it with you
I was lonely

Now, I'm just alone
(Just a matter how I define)
(Just a matter how I define)
Just a matter how i define
My state of mind
Today is a good day

Just a scratch on my ego
I get up in the morning
If we could plan tomorrow
I'll be keeping my mind cold
Until the evening
When the hours forget me
And the waiting awakes me
And the voices of madness
From my subconscious
Just singing songs of sadness

Today is a good day
Today is a good day
Oh such a good day
Today is such a good day
Such a good day
Today is a good day
