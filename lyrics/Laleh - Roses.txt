I will listen in stereo
I’m here
I’m here
it was longtime ago
someone whispered in my ears
and Sevy says she knows me
I wont stay
I wont stay
and she might know me well
but not today, I hope
and this time I’ll be brave
along the clouds
but it takes time to say
here you are

cause I can’t keep the roses
no 
I can’t save the roses
the roses from before
cause I can’t save the roses
no 
I can’t save the roses
the roses from before
I can’t save the roses
the roses from before

how you grow
you grow on me each day
the past I know
but the past don’t know the smell
of your neck
this is all you wanted so you better    believe it
these things don’t happen every day

so I can’t keep the roses
no I can’t keep the roses
the roses from before
so I can’t save the roses
no I can’t keep the roses
the roses from

I don’t have to save the roses from before
oh, I’m pretty sure
I’m going to try the roses
I don’t have to save the rose no
I can’t keep the roses

no I can’t keep the roses from before
I don’t have to save the roses from before.
