I will listen in stereo
I'm here
I'm here
It was longtime ago
Someone whispered in my ears
And Sevy says she knows me
I won't stay
I won't stay
And she might know me well
But not today, I hope
And this time I'll be brave
Along the clouds
But it takes time to say
Here you are

'Cause I can't keep the roses
No
I can't save the roses
The roses from before
'Cause I can't save the roses
No
I can't save the roses
The roses from before
I can't save the roses
The roses from before

How you grow
You grow on me each day
The past I know
But the past don't know the smell
Of your neck
This is all you wanted so you better believe it
These things don't happen every day

So I can't keep the roses
No I can't keep the roses
The roses from before
So I can't save the roses
No I can't keep the roses
The roses from

I don't have to save the roses from before
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I'm going to try the roses
I don't have to save the rose no
I can't keep the roses

No I can't keep the roses from before
I don't have to save the roses from before.
