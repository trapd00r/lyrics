Bless me with the rain
My excuses to the sun
My excuses to every summer cloud

Bless me with the storm
I praise it after dawn
No fence should be blameless
Summer mornings

Lead me away
On this sunny day
I'm just being relieved
I'm pretending

Bless me with the rain
Bless me with the rain
Bless me with the rain
Bless me with the rain

Bless me with the rain
I apologise to the sun
My excuses to each and every one
