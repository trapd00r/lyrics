In the land of raw dope
Ain't no love for suckers
Only real niggas
And real bitches
Strap up and roll
Let a motherfucker know

Hook:

Trigger happy bitch
Giddy up now
This bitch might POW POW!
Trigger happy bitch
Giddy up now
This bitch might POW POW!

Verse 1:

Hoes run the way
Y'all betta recognise
Triggers holdin' down this shit
And it's Shante for the 9 to 5
Wicked bitch of the Westside
Homicide you know the lead
Getting up wid your grammer bitch
Don't you trick
Come wid some more realistic shit
Hands in effect get ya ass kicked
Body blows betta roll
Chi got me be in a bogus fold
Never get me love
Just money hungry
Got a sack of hay
So I'm living naughty
Trigger happy nigga bustin' caps
Hell done broke and bitch is snap
Stick ya up kid for the showdown
You betta leave town fo the sun go down
I'ma throw down on the low down
And run you bitches outta town
(The bitch is trigger happy and she gonna throw down)


Hook 2x

Verse 2:

My name is trigger
And if you pull me and I'm mad
I will straight pop
On some shit in the bogus bitch
Toe to toe this bitch will bust
Head up cause I'm fed up
Some bitches get lead up
Thinking I'm a damn joke
Watch me get realer
Shit ain't nuttin' funny
I'm wreckin' money
Niggas on my fucking bone
Trying to make they self some honey
But uhh, I ain't even wid that shit
To lick the clit
And get on trip
Bitch ain't about that lovey dovey
Bitch all about that hitty witty

Hook 2x
