Ladies, leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and they're pockets full grown
And all you fellas, leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's 11:30 and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Oh, he sayin' he got a girl
Yes, it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Last week and you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man - he was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to stop you, you're going off

You got your hair done and your nails done, too
With your outfit and you're fitting the shoes
Who parlaying at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the fellas rollin' in the Lexus, trucks, and Hummers

Oh, he sayin' he got a girl
Yes, it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Call your boys 'cause tonight you're not gon' stay at home
So tell your girl she ain't coming. Tonight you're going solo
Cut her off 'cause she talks some noise
You know you've got the right to get your party on

So get your hair cut and your car washed, too
Looking like a star in your Armani suit
You need to look your best 'cause you're turning heads tonight
You're gonna find a sexy chica that's gon' dance all night if you wanna
