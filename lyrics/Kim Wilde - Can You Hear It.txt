Feel it in the rushing wind
Brushing up against your mind
Look for a way to go
Head for the border sign
You could be gone
You could be far away
Soon you must fly free

And yes
Somehow you'll find what you've been missing
There was more to life
Than visions we had dreamed about

Can you hear it calling you?
Can you?
Can you hear it calling you?
Can you hear it coming through to you?
When you hear it calling you
It's your freedom

If you are on your own
If you have been betrayed
Stand by the truth you love
Don't let it get mislaid
You're not alone
And nothing can hold you down
Soon you will be free

And yes
Somehow you'll find what you've been missing
There was more to life
Than anything you dreamed about

Can you hear it calling you?
Can you?
Can you hear it calling you?
Can you hear it coming through to you?
When you hear it calling you
It's your freedom
