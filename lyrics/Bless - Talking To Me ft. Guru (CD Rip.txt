(Feat. Guru from Gang Starr)

Yo bless
You know we ripped that show eh
That show was off the charts
Oh boy oh boy
Now man I'm more concerned about gettin' paid
Yo bless wanna battle?
Oh shit he ain't talkin' to you

You talkin' to me?
I don't even know you kid
Don't believe this shit is real we're gonna show you kid
You talkin' to me?
You see I'm well respected, well connected
Watch as we sell these records
You talkin' to me?
Speak up I heard you mumble heard you talkin'
Still got the nerve to stumble
You ain't talkin' to me
I ain't got nothing to say
Leave MC's empty handed with like nothing to spray

(Bless)
I spit that hotness
365 live
Call me obnoxious
All I got is my pride
Short and spotless
With the laces untied
Designing down to the boxes
You feelin' this spot
Cats claimin' they gangsta
They wanna act street
Knowin' 1/16 is on the
Only bars on their rap sheet
I ain't got time to be a thug
The time I did I was enthused
Going against the kid?
You fit to lose
I stay driving
I guess you getting cruised
Ain't no stopin' em
Don't get it confused
This shit is sick like ebola
Mouth like a motor
Dull generator for any show promoter
Toe to toe freestyle
Best flow'r
Bless buildin' off
Right next to Noah's
My career's on a timer
Set to blow up
When I show up, show love

You talkin' to me?
I don't even know you kid
Don't believe this shit is real we're gonna show you kid
You talkin' to me?
You see I'm well respected, well connected
Watch as we sell these records
You talkin' to me?
Speak up I heard you mumble heard you talkin'
Still got the nerve to stumble
You ain't talkin' to me
I ain't got nothing to say
Leave MC's empty handed with like nothing to spray

(Guru)
You ain't talking to me kid
I've been in the streets
Been in the game
Never snitched
That's a sin the streets
Witness the fact
When I'm ripping the tracks
Still alert to the trivia
Lifting this bag
Sipping the yak
Tip to the tack
How you call your shit rap
You gotta sit in the back
I've been in Montreal
Or MIA loungin'
Fake niggaz front moves
Just to make thousand
I'm out for the mil
I'm out for the kill
The sound you get precious
But I doubt that you will
The corner's still hot
Informers till plot
Some suckers still go for it
But I will not
Like New York got corrupt cops
That don't get enough props
Who is he?
Ball hits lizzy
Here's where the buck stops
If they don't want help
If they want your spot
If they want your wealth
Spittin' the truth is never awkward for me
I'm game tight
You ain't talking to me
Swollowing your words
You gift writers got you coping a plea

You talkin' to me?
I don't even know you kid
Don't believe this shit is real we're gonna show you kid
You talkin' to me?
You see I'm well respected, well connected
Watch as we sell these records
You talkin' to me?
Speak up I heard you mumble heard you talkin'
Still got the nerve to stumble
You ain't talkin' to me
I ain't got nothing to say
Leave MC's empty handed with like nothing to spray

(Bless)
I'm just a poet
With a heart of a jazz man
Creating this music
Get me harder than a lap dance
All be this time...
This is my first and last chance
To capitalize on my future plans
Too many burners you can catch a fast pan
I don't look you in the eye
Concentrate on your hands
Hustler to hustler
I could respect that
But I'm an asshole you need to accept that
Scratch my back
Like my spine was a vest tax
I'm shitting on time
It's like I'm sponsored by Ex-Lax
It's a rap when I bless that
Fuck selling my soul
My flow got me in a S-Class
We do what we do for endless ends
Beats in a Mercedez-Benz
With a stick shift for all my lady friends
No wonder you hate me now when you hate me at the end

You talkin' to me?
I don't even know you kid
Don't believe this shit is real we're gonna show you kid
You talkin' to me?
You see I'm well respected, well connected
Watch as we sell these records
You talkin' to me?
Speak up I heard you mumble heard you talkin'
Still got the nerve to stumble
You ain't talkin' to me
I ain't got nothing to say
Leave MC's empty handed with like nothing to spray
