Set me out of control, I want it now
Cause, baby, I fall for you anyhow
Just set me out of control
Tonight's the night
I give you my soul, come on hold me tight
Sex me
Sex me and set me free
Yeah, yeah
Life's not fair
Temptation's almost everywhere
Just look at me and look at you
Let me in, tell me all now we get through
Yeah, yeah
Do it now, if not forbidden then allowed
I'm not your slave, I'm just your man
And, baby, I'm doing all I can
[chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna try and all your needs I'll satisfy
Your body's wild, your body's hot
I've got a lot and I'll give you all I've got
Yeah, yeah
Can't you feel
I'm not just kidding, this's for real
I'm not your prisoner, not your toy
But, baby, I'll bring you a lot of joy
[chorus]
Sex me and set me free
Sex me and set me free
Sex me and set me free
Sex me and set me free
