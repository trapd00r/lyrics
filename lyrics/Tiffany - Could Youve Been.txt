Couldve Been lyrics
The flowers that you gave me
Are just about to die
When I think about what could've been
It makes me want to cry
The sweet words that you whispered
Didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we begin to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Everyday day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never know what could've been
On a cold and lonley night

The memories of our lovin'
Still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere
Everytime I get my hopes up
They only seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what could never be at all

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Everyday day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold what could've been
On a cold and lonley night

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You'll never know what could've been
On a cold and lonley night
How can you know what could've been
On a cold and lonley night
