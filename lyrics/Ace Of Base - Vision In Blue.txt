Someone in this room is the right one for me
But how can it be that I cannot see
I'm biding my time
While drinking my wine, ohoho

I'm gonna be free this weekend, so free
I'm showing off my liberty
Get ready to play, you're making my day
I'm finding a way

But when the night time is all over I'm all alone
I'm advancing and I'm dancing with myself

A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan
A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan

A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan
A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan

I see you dancing in front of my face
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase
I'm flashing for you

A bright light in the night (For you)

I'm gonna be me, myself and I
Losing the rhythm that's my goodbye
I'm feeling the heat, complete with the beat
I'm playing discreet

But when the night time is all over I'm all alone
I'm advancing and I'm dancing with myself

A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan
A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan

A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan
A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan

I see you dancing in front of my face
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase
I'm flashing for you

A vision in blue
A vision in blue
A vision in blue
A vision in blue

A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan
A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan

A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan
A vision in blue, forever young
A token so true, my Koh Phangan

I see you dancing in front of my face
Your body is moving to the trace of the chase
I'm flashing for you

A vision in blue
A vision in blue
