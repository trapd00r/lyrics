I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by

I-I-I-I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice, I belong to your life
Because I will live to love you someday
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away

And I'll fly with you-ou
I'll fly with you-ou-ou
I'll fly with you-ou-ou-ou

I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you 
I'll fly with you

Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side

Oh, baby, every day and every night
Well I said everything's gonna be alright

And I'll fly with you-ou-ou
I'll fly with you-ou-ou-ou
I'll fly with you-ou-ou-ou-ou
