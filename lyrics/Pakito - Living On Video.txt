Give me light 
Give me action 
At the touch of a button. 
Flying through hyper-space 
In a computer interface. 
Stop - living on video 
Stop - integrated circuits. 
Stop - sur un faisceau de lumieres 
Stop - is this reality? 

Traveling in a light beam 
Laser rays and purple skies. 
In a computer fairyland 
It is a dream you bring to life. 
Stop - living on video 
Stop - integrated circuits.... 
Living on video - sur un faisceau de lumieres 

I see your glitterring blue eyes 
You look at me with a smile. 
It's a computer fantasy 
It is waiting for you and me. 
Living - living on video 
Living - living on video 

Living - living on video 
Living - living on video - stop....
