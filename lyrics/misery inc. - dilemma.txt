Slay me down to sleep, pray the evil my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake, pray the evil my soul to take.
How low you can go, lower than anyone I know.
Let the worms eat my flesh, I’m a sinner, I confess.

Obey your lust, you got your heart to freeze.
No one to trust. Face down on your knees.

Flash before my eyes, stronger me in disguise.
Weaker than I should be, seen the things that I shouldn’t see. How low you can go, lower than anyone I know. Let the worms eat my flesh, I’m a sinner, I confess

Obey your lust, you got your heart to freeze.
No one to trust. Face down on your knees.
