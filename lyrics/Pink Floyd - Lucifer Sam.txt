Lucifer Sam Siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side
That cat's something I can't explain

Jennifer Gentle you're a witch
You're the left side
He's the right side oh no
That cat's something I can't explain

Lucifer go to sea
Be a hip cat
Be a ship's cat
Somewhere anywhere
That cat's something I can't explain

At night prowling sifting sand
Padding around on the ground
He'll be found
When you're around
That cat's something I can't explain
