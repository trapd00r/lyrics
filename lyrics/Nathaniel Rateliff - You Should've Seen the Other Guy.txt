We get out of this fight
You gonna help me wrap my hands
Stitching up my eyes
You know blood can blind

And them was big old boys
Had fists like cinder and stone
I dodge a blade on the dime
And they was out to cut my throat

It's a lot, it's a mark they're gonna press down on you
It's a haze on my head, must've been hit too hard, off guard

I think I'm gonna be it tonight
If there's one way out
It's to swing my way through the crowd

Is there a blanket of pain
That I can wrap up in
You've got a hold of me now
Hey that's a hell of a grip
And I admit I was tanked
And you could say I was pissing gin

It's hard to see even if I close my eyes
It's fifteen degrees I'm gonna sleep outside

'Cause I got no way to feel and no way to ride
I'm busted laid up and dry
