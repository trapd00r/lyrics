Woah-woah
Woah-oah-oh-oh
Oah-oh-oh-oh-waoh
Woah-woah

I don't wanna die, but sometimes I'm trying
Sick of this life, swear I'm always climbing
Lost in my head, tonight
Say my prayers sometimes
I'm not scared to say goodbye
I'ma ride, I'ma die for this shit
Give me my respect, you won't end up on my hit list
You ain't seen a thing, nah bitch, you ain't from the trenches
Got some money bags, but you'll never be a misfit

Better watch what you say to me
Whole family with me and they pray for me
Coming back for all that they take from me
Turning down deals ain't a thing for me

No, I won't fake it
When I see my shot, I'ma slide, I'ma take it
Never sell my soul, saying "Fuck being famous"
I ain't bout to sign unless you throwing me like 8 figs
I ain't bout to die for no one

All my life I've been running way too fast
I spent like all my time on some things that never last
I'm falling

I never wanted this, my omens been ominous
Ever since I been dominant
Since the money been bottomless
Man, I just don't have the time for this
I'm tryna focus on all the positives
But these vultures been so prominent, so now I'm dropping this
See I've always been going against the grain
Wrap my demons in cellophane
Gas em up and then light the flame
But they still seem to know my fate
If I don't make it out I wonder what'll be my life
Sometimes it feels the only way out of this ain't alive

All my life I've been running way too fast-
I spent like all my time on some things that never last
I'm falling

I don't wanna die, but sometimes I'm trying
Sick of this life, swear I'm always climbing
Lost in my head, tonight
Say my prayers sometimes
I'm not scared to say goodbye
I'ma ride, I'ma die for this shit
Give me my respect, you won't end up on my hit list
You ain't seen a thing, nah bitch, you ain't from the trenches
Got some money bags, but you'll never be a misfit

Better watch what you say to me
Whole family with me and they pray for me
Coming back for all that they take from me
Turning down deals ain't a thing for me
