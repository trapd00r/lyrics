In the half light you're looking alright
But did you read the small print, did you read it in the light?
Hold on tight boys, it's gonna be fine
It's the sequel to the prequel tonight
All the girls want to drink and talk shite
All of the women want to fuck and to fight
Well Buba Wilkes said we need another line
It's the sequel to the prequel tonight

All these heartfelt songs and melodies
My melancholy baby
Are guests that never left my memory
My melancholy girl
Momma said hold your head up high
At the sequel to the prequel tonight

Stuck on rain, the dark and the light
Heavy for the prequel and sequel is tight
Your momma said to hold your head up high
At the sequel to the prequel, alright
The moonlight is fierce bright tonight
You could loop it with a lasso and give it to the bride
The bride's momma says, oh he's so kind
At the sequel to the prequel tonight

All these heartfelt songs and melodies
My melancholy baby
Are guests that never left and will never leave
My melancholy girl
Momma said hold your head up high
Poppa said hold your head up high
Everybody says hold your head up high
At the sequel to the prequel tonight
