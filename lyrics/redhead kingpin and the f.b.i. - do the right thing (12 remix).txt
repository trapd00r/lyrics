'Check this out' ... 'Check this out'

'Ah yeah'
'Ah yeah'
'Ah yeah'

'Ah, ah yeah'
'Ah, Ah yeah)

Do the right thing, not talking about a black or white thing
'Cause that will cause conflict to make this thing legit
But your definition of legit and illegitimate
Is confusion now the redhead one has said
To make things clearer, 'cause in about a year or two 
What you do is take a look up in the mirror
And what you see is the image of hate
That you shed upon the others of sisters and the brothers
Now in my opinion you need someone to teach
The whole world is acting like a giant Howard Beach
I asked my man victor, what he used to do for fun
He said, he learned to shoot a gun before the age of 21
Crime and abortion, all kinds of mind distortion
This is very important but just a little caution 
Of what you can do, here's a clue and it's true, yo
Don't wanna burn your sweater, make your life better, do the right thing

'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing' Do the right thing
'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing'

Brothers are stealin' and dealin' and big wheelin'
And to a younger mind that stuff is appealin'
So what do they do, they gather up a crew
Go out and steal and rob instead of gettin' a job
Now your mother tried to bring you up better than that
The same way she loved you you loved her right back
But now you think you're grown and you argue a lot
Over money you got from dealin' stuff on the block
Now you're not the only one in the world that has problems
Keep your head straight and you can surely solve them
Be a fly guy and reach sky high
And like the Jeffersons you get a piece of the pie
I hope you take heed to the message I brought
In other words: the lesson I taught
The Redhead kick a lyric but I won't sing
And the FBI Crew wants you, and you and you to do the right thing

'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing' Do the right thing
'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing' 

Right about now we're gonna start using our own words now
Gonna be counted off as we go on something like this
One, two, three

And Manhattan, you got to do the right thing
Brooklyn, you got to do the right thing
And the Bronx you got to do the right thing

Bruise Island, you got to do the right thing
Long Island, you got to do the right thing
Staten Island, you got to do the right thing
On the West Coast, you got to do the right thing
Everybody, everybody in the world, you got to do the right thing

Do the right thing 'Check this out'
'Ah yeah'
Do the right thing
'Ah yeah'
Do the right thing

'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing' Do the right thing
'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing'

The Redhead One sendin' out a message on a positive note
Try to make you all see the light when we're supposed to be in the dark
Y'know, this is goin' out to my mother, to my brother
To the rest of the FBI tribe

And you know what I'm sayin'
Everybody else in the world
I just want y'all to do one thing
And that's the right thing

'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing' Do the right thing
'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
'Do the right thing'

'Do the right thing' You got to do the right thing
