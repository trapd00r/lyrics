She had those magic eyes
You could see from miles around
She wore her summer dresses bright
Quite like the sky

She always came in colours
All smiles and daffodils
She let her hair down in the breeze

But every little thing has changed today
Little Miss Sorrow
Every little thing turned pale then faded
Little Miss Sorrow
The sunlight doesn't show
All the colours go out through the window

She used to go out dancing
Cool silver fingernails
I used to watch her from the bar
Following her car

She always came in colours
She always kept control
She painted yesterday in gold

But every little thing turned grey today
Little Miss Sorrow
Every little thing turned pale then faded
Little Miss Sorrow
The sunlight doesn't show
All the colours go even the rainbow

Allow me to introduce myself
I'm just a local boy
She was my Little Miss Joy
I want to call her name
My life won't be the same, Dear God

Every little thing has changed today
Little Miss Sorrow
Every little thing turned pale and faded
Little Miss Sorrow
Yes, every little thing turned grey today
Little Miss Sorrow
The weak replaced the strong
The bird forgot the song

What's going on?
What's going on?
Tell me, what's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
Tell me, what's going on?
