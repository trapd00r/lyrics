I see lovers hand in hand
(But) I find myself alone
And a teardrop falls
From every thought of loneliness
Something's missing - something's gone
Could it be you?
I wanna know
Could it be you?
Just tell me girl

Was it real love
I remember and it kills
Was it real love
I let go and I feel
I need your love
But all I have are memories
There's still a part of you inside of me

I didn't understand what we had
I didn't know just where to go
I didn't realise we were lost in love
How does anyone ever know
You got away
I'm not over you
Time slips away
Now I have to know

Was it real love
I remember and it kills
Was it real love
I let go and I feel
I need your love
Cause all I have are dreams of you
Is there part of me inside of you

I'll be holding on to you forever
You've become a part of me
And I will hold you close
Inside my heart
There's only you

Was it real love
I remember and it kills
Was it real love
(Now) I'm older and I feel
I need your love
But all I have are memories
There's always part of you inside of me

Was it real love
I remember and it kills
Was it real love
(Now) I'm older and I feel
I need your love
But all I have are memories
There's always part of you inside of me

Was it real love
I remember and it kills
Was it real love
(Now) I'm older and I feel
I need your love
But all I have are memories
There's always part of you inside of me
