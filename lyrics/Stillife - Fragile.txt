Cheer up, it might never happen, no
It might never happen, we will see
As I sit here spitting and churning, no
It's clear that it's happening right now to me

Make it special
For a loved one
For a stranger
This is subtle
Hard to come by
Extraordinary thing

Oh no, there's even something
Something's got to be better than nothing.
Just because it's the end of the beginning,
Doesn't mean it's the beginning of the end.

Fallen fragile
Broken busted
All for nothing
Sing my heart out
For a stranger
Extraordinary thing

Sing my heart out
For a stranger
Extraordinary thing
