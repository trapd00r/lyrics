(Music:Magnusson / Lyrics:Jarrebring)

Jormundgand lashes the ocean 
The sun is darkened 
Total devastation 
The fires roar 
And the stars falls from heaven 
Yggdrasil tremble 
And there is chaos 

The master of the underworld 
Together with the chaos forces 

Attacks the gods world 
Riding over Bifrost 
The bridge to Asgard 
Heimdall blows the Gjallarhorn 
The final battle 
Is all over us 
The forces meets to fight 

The sun has died 
So has the stars 
The heaven bursts 
The earth is engulfed 

The fate of the gods
