Now give me a beat
Dance sweat move your body
Jump around start to party
Enjoy yourself you are not are stereo type
Express yourself then you will feel alright
All night cause it's party time
That's why I'm here kicking a rhyme
Get up get down get into the break
Stop . . .
Four and three and two and one
Here we go let's have some fun
"fresh music" is what it's all about
Now all the ladies scream and shout
Now get crazy and start humping dancing
Jumping sliding and act like a wild thing
I got the rhythm which keeps you pumping
Cause my singing lady makes you jumping
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now right now
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now uh uh yehey
Move your feet to the rhythm of the beat
Pump up the volume feel the heat
Turn up the bass and get steady
Let the music move you get ready
Shake it break it just take it
Get on the dancefloors I make it
Rhythm and bass give you the power
Like another nuclear shower
Once again the place is grooving
The record's playing the crowd is moving
Pump up the bass in the place
Party people ain't no time to waste
No matter how fast you walk I'm faster
Don't let me get to you I'm the master
I play the hits and you start the party
Come on girl let's pump that body
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now right now
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now uh uh yehey
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now right now
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now uh uh yehey
Let the bass go
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now right now
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now uh uh yehey
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now right now
Just keep on dancing just keep on dancing
Right now uh uh yehey
Pump up the volume feel the heat
Go go go go go go
