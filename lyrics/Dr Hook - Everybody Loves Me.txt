Everybody must be on drugs, in this town
Or maybe there's a strange new bug that's been going round
'Cause people are all smiling and waving as I go by
Everybody loves me but I don't know why

It used to be a kind face was a rarity
But now I got friends coming out both ends just to visit me
But it don't make sense 'cause my confidence has been destroyed
Everybody loves me but I'm paranoid

What ever happened to the cold cruel world I used to understand
When every road was paved with wet cement
Back when if I was hanging off a cliff you'd be walking on my hands
Somebody please tell me where all the good times went whooo

Every time I needed something, no-one'd ever give me nothing, it'd never fail
I had to sit right down and write myself a letter just to get mail
But now my ears are singing from the damn ding-a-linging of the telephone
Everybody loves me but I'm comin' home

What ever happened to the cold cruel world I used to understand
When every road was paved with wet cement
Back when if I was hanging off a cliff you'd be dancin' on my hands
Somebody please tell me where all the good times went whooo

Every time I needed something, no-one'd ever give me nothing, it'd never fail
I had to sit right down and write myself a letter just to get mail
But now my ears are singing from the damn ding-a-linging of the telephone
Everybody loves me but I'm comin' home
