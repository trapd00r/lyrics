Now when I was just a little boy, standin' to my Daddy's knee
My poppa said, "Son, don't let the man get you, do what he done to me.
'Cause he'll get you
'Cause he'll get you now, now."

And I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwoods bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Yoh, yoh

Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Yoh, yoh

Do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh, Lord

Oh, get back, boy

I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwoods bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Yoh, yoh
Born on the Bayou
Alright!

Do, do, do, do

Mm-mm-mmm, oh...
