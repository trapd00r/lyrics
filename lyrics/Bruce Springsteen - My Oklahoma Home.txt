When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip,
I wanted some place to call my own
And so I made the race, and staked me out a place,
And settled down along the Cimarron

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home, it blowed away
Well it looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there,
But my Oklahoma home, it blowed away

I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats,
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face
Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow
And I also got a fancy mortgage on the place

It blowed away, it blowed away,
All the crops I planted blowed away
Well you can't grow any grain if you ain't got any rain;
Everything except the mortgage blowed away

It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there,
I figured I was all set for life
I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
And went to town and picked me out a wife

She blowed away, she blowed away
My Oklahoma woman blowed away
Mister as I bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister;
My Oklahoma woman blowed away

Well then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan
Of the wind around the corners of my shack;
So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed,
A-travelin' with the wind upon my back

I blowed away, I blowed away
Chasin that dust cloud up ahead
Once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air;
My Oklahoma farm is overhead

Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,
For Oklahoma dust is everywhere
Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my chickens squawkin'
I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away
But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere,
My Oklahoma home that blowed away

Now I'm a roamin' Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home
And I'll never get homesick 'til I die
Cause no matter where I'm found, my home is all around;
My Oklahoma home is in the sky

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My farm down upon the Cimarron
Well now all around the world, wherever dust is whirled,
There's some from my Oklahoma home

It blowed away, it blowed away,
Yeah my Oklahoma home blowed away.
Yes it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by, my Oklahoma home is blowed away

Well its blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away.
It's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by, my Oklahoma home is in the sky
