You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Boy, I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind

'Cause each and every time you near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you, "What's the deal?"
You hold it all inside

If you wanna be with me
You gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel

'Cause boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come and get my love
It's all here for you

You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

If you keep actin' this way
You're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play
You better hurry up

'Cause every time I come around
And cruise around your way
I see you on the corner
But you don't know what to say

When I walk up to you baby
You seem so shy
What's the problem baby
Never had a girl like I

I can see right through you
And you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together
'Cause you're running out of time

You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You say, yes

You won't regret, I must confess
I'm really feelin' you
Anything you've ever wanted before
Is right here for you, for you

Don't worry what they say
Just bring you're love away
'Cause your friends can't do
What I can for you
I don't wanna hear you say

Baby tell me
Tell me, yes
Don't tell me, no

You'll be sayin'
No
When it's really
Yes
You'll be sayin'
No
When it's really
Yes

You'll be sayin'
No
When it's really
Yes
You'll be sayin'
No
When it's really
Yes

You'll be sayin'
No
