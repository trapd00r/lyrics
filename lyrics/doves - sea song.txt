Drive with me
Do the things you wont believe
Drive with me
Past the city and down to sea

Crushing Dreams
Leave me be, I cannot sleep

Drown with me
Past the city, down to sea
Rush of dream
Leave in peace, let me be

oh, it's the pain
It's ingrained in me
oh, soothe my pain
It's ingrained in me

Drive with me
