Down slips the morning and soaks the trees
Faces come wandering out of their homes
Pale
In the middle of the street

(Leave it all) colors sharp as razor blades
(I leave it all) and just as deadly
I cut my hand

(I take off)
Bird calls twice before it circles away (I take off)
I knew I'd be standing here again
Back upon this long unwanted road

Down slips the morning
Sounds spreads out
Thins the fog

Colors sharp as razor blades
And just as deadly
Cut my hands
On the reflections

The water runs
Bird calls twice
And circles away
There's a third circle

I knew I'd be standing here again
Back upon this long unwanted road
I ring the bell awakening
The sound spreads out
Thins the fog on the hillside
While that distant sun still shines
