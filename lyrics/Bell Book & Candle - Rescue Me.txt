Yeah, I wanna have the time
And I wanna see you cry
I wanna feel your body
And I wanna get closer
Gotta rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me, let me have a good time


And I wanna see you laughing
And I wanna feel rain
I wanna get inside you
And I wanna feel pain
Gotta rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me, let me have a good time

And I wanna feel you moving
And I wanna feel good
I wanna feel you love for sure

Let your, let your
Let your amazement grow
Let your, let your
Let your amazement grow

Oh, whatever you do
I can't leave you
Don't ever let me go
Don't ever let me go

Yeah, I wanna be hungry
And I wanna ask why
I wanna be dreaming
And I wanna satisfy
You gotta rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me, let me have a good time

And I wanna be loved
And I wanna be high
I wanna feel you touch me
And I wanna hear you sigh
You gotta rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me, let me have a good time

And I wanna feel you moving
And I wanna feel good
I wanna feel you love for sure

Let your, let your
Let your amazement grow
Let your, let your
Let your amazement grow

Oh, whatever you do
I can't leave you
Don't ever let me go
Don't ever let me go

Let your, let your
Let your
Let your, let your
Let your

Let your, let your
Let your amazement grow
Let your, let your
Let your amazement grow

Oh, whatever you do
I can't leave you
Don't ever let me go
Don't ever let me go
