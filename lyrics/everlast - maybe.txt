Maybe you can take a little piece of my pain.
Maybe you can make it all feel the same.
Maybe you can burn this night in my brain.
Maybe you can find some else's blame
For all this pain'
Maybe, maybe

Maybe you can tell me about your worst fear
Don't say it out loud whisper in my ear.
Ain't never found nothing like this here.
Maybe you could see things a little more clear.
Dry away your tear'

And I love you are just three words
That are overused when we're talking
Love and friendship situation
Can confuse us along

Maybe I should give this one my name
a piece of my pain...
Maybe, maybe.

Maybe we can talk about all my dreams
Watch 'em all come apart at the scene.
Sometimes when it rains really teen?
Sometimes they cut diamonds with laser beams
Whatever that means

And I love you are just three words
that are overused when we're talking
Love and friendship situation
Can confuse us along

Maybe I should give this one my time
And that would be fine
Maybe, maybe.

And I love you are just three words
That are overused when were talking,
Love and friendship situation
Can confuse us along

Maybe I should give this one my name
A piece of my pain
Maybe, maybe.
