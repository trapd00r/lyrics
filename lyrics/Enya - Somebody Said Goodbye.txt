Summer. When the day is over
There's a heart a little colder;
Someone said goodbye,
But you don't know why.
Somewhere there is someone keeping
All the tears they have been weeping,
Someone said goodbye,
But you don't know why.

Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry?
Is there a reason
You were lost although you don't know why?
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye.
If there's a reason,
I don't know why.

Always looking for meaning,
All the time you keep believing,
But I don't know why
You won't say goodbye.

Even when the sun is shining
You don't see the silver lining,
But you don't know why
You won't say goodbye.

Is there a reason
Why a broken dream can never fly?
Is there a reason
You believe and you close your eyes?
Give me a reason
Why you hide away so much inside.
If there's a reason,
I don't know why.

Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry?
Is there a reason
You were lost although you don't know why?
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye.
If there's a reason,
I don't know why. [Repeat:x4]
