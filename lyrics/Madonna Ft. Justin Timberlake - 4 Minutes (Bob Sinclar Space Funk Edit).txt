Uh. Yeah. Ha.
Breakdown, c'mon
Hey! Uh. C'mon. Madonna. Break it.

Come on boy, I've been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll

I want somebody to speed it up for me then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? (are you ready to go?)

[Justin and Madonna]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word and imma give you what you want

Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy and grab a girl

Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got 4 minutes, 4 minutes

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up, don't be a pri... (hey) Madonna, uh

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock

Sometimes I think what I need is a you intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh, hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah

But if I die tonight
At least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word and imma give you what you want

Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy and grab a girl

Time is waiting
We only got 4 minutes to save the world
No hesitating
We only got 4 minutes, 4 minutes

So keep it up, keep it up, don't be a pri... (hey) Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em up, hop
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
