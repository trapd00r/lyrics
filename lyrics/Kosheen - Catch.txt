Come down
When you find me in the fading light
Know everything gets better
Fall out
There is nowhere we can run and hide
And all that matters

Is to let us feel
Tonight is do or die
We let the love begin
So we could come alive

Don't be afraid
Just let it go
I will be there
To catch you when you fall

Don't be afraid
Just let it go
I will be there
To catch you when you fall

I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall

Don't be afraid
Just let it go
I will be there
To catch you when you fall

I'll catch you when you fall

Breathe in
Can you breathe me in to live out loud
We'll make it last forever
Give in
With every little bit you've got inside
Cuz all that matters

Is to let us feel
Tonight is do or die
We let the love begin
So we could come alive

Don't be afraid
Just let it go
I will be there
To catch you when you fall

Don't be afraid
Just let it go
I will be there
To catch you when you fall

I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall

Don't be afraid
Just let it go
I will be there
To catch you when you fall

I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall
