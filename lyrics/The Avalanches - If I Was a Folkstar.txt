Hey alright
Kip Kasper, KLON Radio
How we feelin' out there?
How's your drive-time commute?

[Toro y Moi:]
I remember when she took me to the world in my mind
Who wants time when there's nothing she sets in the sky?
And I'd like to see her any day
I know I can't be gone every weekend
Let's wake up side by side
Let's sleep in till we die
Don't make me close my eyes
I won't believe
I won't believe
(Oooh)
(I won't believe)
Let's wake up side by side
Let's sleep in till we die
Don't make me close my eyes
I won't believe
(I won't believe)
(I won't believe)
