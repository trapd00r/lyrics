Listen, to the phatt bass... 

Kick the bass, let's play (X4) 

Kick the bass, let's play it loud 

I want you to stop.

It'll show you you're alive. 

And listen to this phat bass that will send the blood coarsing through your veins.

To here we're gonna rock, let's play it loud (X2) 

To here we're gonna rock (X7)

Kick the bass, let's play it loud. 

Kick the bass, let's play it loud. 

Kick the bass, let's play it loud.
