Hold my hand if you want to be there
When I'm falling down
Call my name, call my name
Before I hit the ground

Do you feel alone when you're surrounded by
Everyone you know
Do you ever feel down
Like you're six feet underground
Can't dig your way out this hole

Come rain, come shine
You're happy all the time
Your dreams they didn't come true
What the hell happened to you
Are you waiting for the call
I guess they didn't get through it all
Be like me, prepare to fall
Prepare to fall

Don't always aim for the top
When you're riding high
There's a long long way to drove

Do you feel alone when you're surrounded by
Everyone you know
Do you ever feel down
Like you're six feet underground
Can't dig your way out this hole

Come rain, come shine
You're happy all the time
Your dreams they didn't come true
What the hell happened to you
Are you waiting for the call
I guess they didn't get through it all
Be like me, prepare to fall
Prepare to fall

Are you gonna fall?
Are you gonna climb?
Are you gonna rise?
Is now your time?

Are you gonna fall?
Are you gonna climb?
Are you gonna rise?
Is now your time?

Come rain, come shine
You're happy all the time
Your dreams they didn't come true
What the hell happened to you
Are you waiting for the call
I guess they didn't get through it all
Be like me, prepare to fall
Prepare to fall
