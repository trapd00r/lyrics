Oh yeah

When I hold you baby
Feel your heart beat close to me
Wanna stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free

When I wake each morning
And the sun beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Only love can set you free

set you free x4
Oh yeah

When we touch each other
In the state of ecstasy
Want this night to last forever
Only love can set you free

Set you free x 4

Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Set you free
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah

Oh yeah

When I hold you baby
Feel your heart beat close to me
Wanna stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free

Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Set you free
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
