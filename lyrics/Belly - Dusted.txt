Baby's playing dead in cellar
Gave her water just got paler
Grass stains back burns
She's a screamer
She's just dusted, leave her

If you see her, don't upset her
Never seems to get much better
Grass stains back burns
She's a screamer
She's just dusted, leave her

Her hmm, hmm, goes to your heart
Her hmm, hmm sticks in your head
Her hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm

Baby's playing dead in cellar
Gave her water
Just got paler
Grass stains, back burns
She's a screamer
She's just dusted, leave her
