Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and it's all she wrote

You're staring straight into a barrel of hate terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Night's over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told you that spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blind-fold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind
Hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
Well I won't buy her soda unless it's Rock & Rye Cola
(Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye/die for you
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pull 5 molars
You get your eyes swoll' up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and it's all she wrote

TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig you ho
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, it's you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chilling like a villain
Like the penguin in its fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
'Fore I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
There's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfucking stud
Slut, this'll teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way for shizzle
I still live like I budget a Gilbert's Lodge check stub, bizzle
So fuck sizzler. This check is a bust like a blood blister

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and it's all she wrote

Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, Iâ€™ll stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock I'm racing it
Double timing it, but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
That it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and it's all she wrote

All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over and that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over
And that's all she wrote
