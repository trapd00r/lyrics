Got a job that's okay
But they got me working night and day
Punching in, punching out
Is this really what life's all about?

(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna feel?)
I don't know
(What'cha gonna feel, what'cha gonna do?)
Ooh, won't someone tell me
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna do?)
There's only one thing left to say
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna say?)

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah
(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)

Baby's gone, all alone
Are you sad because you're on your own?
Get that girl, party down
There's so many good ones still around

(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna feel?)
I don't know
(What'cha gonna feel, what'cha gonna do?)
Ooh, won't someone tell me
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna do?)
I guess there's just one thing to say
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna say?)
Woo

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah, ooh
(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh

Hey it's J.J, what you been doin'
You say your car broke down, the thing just isn't movin'
J.J.J., don't you know
When you're down there's just one way to go
Now sing it

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Sometimes
(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Ooh, yeah
(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(That's life)
You know it

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
