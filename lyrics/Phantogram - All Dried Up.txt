All dried up
In the morning light
Realize my love is gone
Tell me that you're fine
Are you staying warm
Can you show me a sign
Without your body

I can't feel my my love anymore
I can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still walking
I can't feel my love anymore
I can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still running
I'm still running

Last night I had a dream
That the sky would part
And you'd come for me
Can you keep me waiting
Until the sun goes down
I am dying here
Without my body

I can't feel my love anymore
I can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still walking
I can't feel my love anymore
I can't feel my legs anymore
But I'm still running

I'm still running
