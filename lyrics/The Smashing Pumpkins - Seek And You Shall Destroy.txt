If gods are strong
And cities fraught
Then how am I still here?
In fits and starts
Speak underground
Let's kid with hidden mirrors

Yes, I'm strange
No, I'm breaking off
For other worlds
What's an evening's drill
Disabused by her
And magazine

Seek and you shall destroy me
Seek and you shall destroy me
To faces form a victor's sonnet
To faces, our night comes
To an early close
In miniature of stark
And sweet repose

Sling and arrow's kite
A priestly psyche
Yet here lies aalvary
By telescopic art
And mason's arm
In apertur, drums asleep

To those undaunted
Those unwanted
Lost as well as wrought
You're in a tranquil spot
Turning, turning to no one else

Seek and you shall destroy me
Seek and you shall destroy me
So libertine climb
And brigantine sign
The Elohim for peace

Seek and you shall destroy, you shall destroy me
Seek and you shall destroy, you shall destroy me
Oh, mystic blackguards
Go with glass hearts
And brace with better shield
