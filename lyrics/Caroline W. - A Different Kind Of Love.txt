You say a man can change how he feels
To live by a plan
I find that impossible
Coz from the start
It's always been right
And here tonight
You know we're unstoppable

A crowded room is empty without you
But it light's up when you're around
In ways I never thought of

You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
Yeah night and day you're there to keep my feet on the ground
With a different kind of love

When we're alone, silence is right
You don't need to speak a word to convince me
And when we're close you take me away
That you feel the same, it's amazing

I can't imagine ever being without you
You're holding my heart in your hands
In ways I never thought of

You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
And when I'm down the words you say can turn it around
With a different kind of love

Yeah your love

You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
Yeah night and day you're there to keep my feet on the ground
With a different kind of love

You bring a different kind of love
A different kind of love
And when I'm down the words you say can turn it around
With a different kind of love
