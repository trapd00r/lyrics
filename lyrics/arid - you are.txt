I want to live with you 
In your beds of bliss 
Want to hide out 
In your tenderness 
I want the world to be 
Made complete 
On your life I will feed

You are 
The summer rain 
You are 
What I can't explain 
You are 
The hurt inside 
You are 
What I cannot hide

It's freezing you 
You're frozen still 
Memories 
Come flooding in 
Turn the reel 
Reverse the past 
Are you trying to make 
This moment last?

You are 
The summer rain 
You are 
What I can't explain 
You are 
The hurt inside 
You are 
What I cannot hide

I want to live within 
I can't live without 
I want to build it up 
So it can break me down 
I am gonna let him have 
His way with you 
Do all things
that I wanted to

You are 
The summer rain 
You are 
What I can't explain 
You are 
The hurt inside 
You are 
Feeling 
Free 
Born into the last divide 

You are 
Like the summer rain 
You are 
What I can't explain 
You are 
The hurt inside 
You are

And again, and again
And again, and again
And again, and again
And again, and again

The murder inside
The murder inside
The murder inside
The murder inside
