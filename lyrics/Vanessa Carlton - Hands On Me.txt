Two, three

I first saw you at the video exchange
I know my heart, and it will never change
This temp work would be alright if you'd call me, you'd call me 
I lie awake at night for you and I pray

We cross the deepest oceans
Cargo across the sea
And if you don't believe me
Just put your hands on me
And all the constellations 
Shine down for us to see
And if you don't believe me 
Just put your hands on me

The subway radiates with heat
We barely met and still I cross the street
To your door 

We cross the deepest oceans
Cargo across the sea
And if you don't believe me
Just put your hands on me
And all the constellations 
Shine down for us to see
And if you don't believe me 
Just put your hands on me

Someday when our stories are told
They'll tell of a love like this
When our descendants are all growing old
A thousand years we'll be singing
Na, na na, na na, na na na na

We climb Tibetan mountains
Where we can barely breathe
I see the Dalai Lama 
I feel him blessing me
And all the constellations 
Shine down for us to see
And if you don't believe me 
Just put your hands on me

Na na na na na na na (hands on me)
Your hands on me (hands on me)
Na na na na na na na (hands on me)
