i know a place we could go
i know a place where there aren't any roads
where the grass is always greener,
and doesn't scratch your fingers
i know a place

so come with me dear,
the halogen hum hurts my ears
swim in the spring,
we could be free

cause i know a place we could go
no one has been there, and no one will know
there it is quiet, forget the violence
you've tried so hard to ignore

oh, i know a place we could go
unpack our bags and we'll call it a home
the sea will sing our minds to sleep
i know a place we could go

and once we get there we could stay
an old shaky house, our lives would be made
and i don't know all the answers
but you look like december
there we could stay

i'm tired of fear
grasping for safe, familiar
you are like me, oh, could we leave?

cause i know a place we could go
far from the highways, far from that home
seep in the silence, safe in our minds that
we try so hard to control

oh, i know a place we could go
no one will notice once we are gone
up in the trees, laugh on the beach
i know a place we could go

can we go home?

cause i know a place we could go
deep in the forest, out of the storm
our souls could be freed of the disease
that everyone tried to destroy

oh, i know a place we could go
no one has been there, no one will know
the sea will sing our minds to sleep
i know a place we could go

could we go home?
