Opening scene, human kind panics from a dying planet
Try to understand it...
They say thunderbirds fly to preserve our skies
If Geo Engineers lie, they deserve to die, they deserve to die

The air that you breathe
Indigo breeze
Throw a flare and light it
Spread the ashes all around you
You're holding the key
Know what you believe
Don't inhale all the cold air
Let it drift around your body

How could life not be real, running over the rolling hills
Rolling around in lush green fields
It's just a reminder that every day the sun rises
And I re new my Mer-Ka-Ba
I look into her blue iris
There she is, Delilah, seductive, yet so silent
With whispers of inspiration, from the valley of the faceless
A gift for all human races
Surface to air, air to ground, across firmament
Wherever my love is allowed
I stand up to command hate to stand down
Not much left in the sand glass now
I'm just a man, learning to not trust the lies that
I'm just beginning to understand
I feel betrayed & now I don't what to say
It all changed when the sky turned grey

The air that you breathe
Indigo breeze
Throw a flare and light it
Spread the ashes all around you
You're holding the key
Know what you believe
Don't inhale all the cold air
Let it drift around your body

My water is brackish from unpaid Mad Max taxes
Jet planes make multiple passes
Suffering from thunderstorm asthma, chest grabbin
This is madness, follow the white rabbit
Down the hole, can barely hear the sound of my soul
It's so cold, where did the sun go?
I stand atop Mount Fiji, Canibus can you see me?
Thru the thick chem trail graffiti?

Some argue that the earth is flat
It's a scientific fact, the fake news debates to distract
Meanwhile we hold our throats, cough a choke
Chemical smoke, you still think a chem trail is a hoax
No – the human race is reduced to cockroaches
They run from Lord Vader as he approaches
They poison our air, land and oceans with sub micronal global aerosol, told you

The air that you breathe
Indigo breeze
Throw a flare and light it
Spread the ashes all around you
You're holding the key
Know what you believe
Don't inhale all the cold air
Let it drift around your body
Rise up high and fly
Let it drift around your body
Rise up high and fly
Battle cries go off around me
Rise up high and fly
Let it drift around your body
Rise up high and fly
Battle cries go off around me

They took my blue skies away
It's like the whole planet died that day
Humans become breathing semiconductors, weapons of mass respiratory destruction, imagine!?! sky captains snuffing out the masses through stereo lithographics, the atmospheric enabler, barometric vapors cut thru ya' lung tissue like razor sharp light sabers cut thru wafers, of deeply satanic nature, It's the will of Lord Vader, deactivated T-Cell receptors, deprivation of clean oxygen is a weapon, question, how can you live if you can't breath? and where will you go if they ever succeed?, technology nano, crops can't grow, from extreme drought to sand storms and bad snow, Surface acoustic spray chemical aggregate saturates every God given breath we take, I didn't before but now I can see – the evil attached to the very air we breathe

The air that you breathe
Indigo breeze
Throw a flare and light it
Insomnia freaks wide awake
Contaminated every breath we take
Spread the ashes all around you
You're holding the key
Know what you believe
Don't inhale all the cold air
I feel betrayed with nothing to say
It all changed when the skies turned grey
Let it drift around your body
Rise up high and fly
Let it drift around your body
They took our blue skies away
Rise up high and fly
Battle cries go off around me
They took our blue skies away
Rise up high and fly
Let it drift around your body
They took our blue skies away
Rise up high and fly
They took our blue skies away
Battle cries go off around me
It all changed when the skies turned grey
