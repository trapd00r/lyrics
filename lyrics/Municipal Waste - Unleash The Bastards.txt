Millions lay dead
Resistance is futile
Armies are crushed
Bodies thrown in piles
Rich white man's dream
Once gained through the machines
Brought pain to this world
Through bloodlust and greed
The new hounds of war
Mechanical Bastards
Ripping through flesh
Destroying their masters
Programmed to kill
Destroying at will
The brilliant turned fools
Now punished by their tools

The time has come
For all your leaders to die
Electrified hate
Your blood an their circuits will fry
Bring on the war
Unleash the bastards
Prisoners no more
Destroying their masters
Fleets take the night
Destroying mankind
Those that revolt
Will spill blood from their throats

Wise up and see your fate
Witness the mechanical advance
Rise up but it's too late
You should have stood up when you had the chance

But now the world's a living hell
The stench of death is all you smell
The ground is scorched
The air is black
The sound of your neck being snapped
What was an earth worth fighting for?
Now destroyed by the corporate whore
An over load of greed and wealth
Who's gonna save them from themselves?
