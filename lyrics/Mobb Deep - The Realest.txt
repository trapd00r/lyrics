(Feat. Kool G Rap)

(Pee) this the killa's shit dun
(G. Rap) No Doubt .The undisputed...

(Kool G. Rap) For street niggas livin' with they lives on the line
(Prodigy) For young guns comin' up during these times
(Kool G. Rap) For police that find drugs let niggas slide
(Prodigy) For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
(Kool G. Rap) For your man's not snitchin' when the pressure is tight
(Prodigy) For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
(Kool G. Rap) For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
(Prodigy) This be the realest shit you heard in your life.

(Kool G. Rap)
Yo When the gats reveal
You cats get peeled and that's the deal
Fuck a bitch-ass that switch fast niggas that lack the real
When the slugs burst
G.Rap be aiming at your mug first
Niggas is blood thirst
We'll see who get plugged worst
We dug earth
The place you put the nickel-plate is to your facial
Bullets ain't racial kid the only hate you
My nine will seem like it's a time machine B.C. date you
Jacking you more than ripper
My fifth's an organ shifter
The human organism lifter
You'll be hearing organs
If ya leaving orphans, If ya
Let these fours hit ya where the law split ya
A fork pitcher
To bump heads with those that dump lead
Accurate shot in back of your knot
Leave you one dead G.Rap, Havoc and Prodigy
Let's put these bitch niggas where bodies be dun
Yo if it gotta be, it gotta be

(Havoc)
Yo when the gat spit
Some niggaz get blown off the atlas
It happens unsolved mystery re-enatmus
Get practiced what you lack is
You think like the average
Jake stoop down and leavin' crime scenes entangled
Nothing but cannons get conspicuous
Like a man a little branded with the serial scratched
Wild out a part of the pack 'cause they made me like that
If I could push back the clock probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my nigga G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here plus my kin
Killa B forever with me
Quick to settle with me
Into QB to show love throughout the years with me
You got guns we got guns the serious ones
Leaving foul powder stuck in your lungs
We come from where niggas look out for they dun-duns
Love never disrespect hit shit to re-direct

(Prodigy)
Never prejudge
It be the humble that squeeze slugs
It be the ones standin' still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my duns thuggin' for me
Man you don't wanna get involved fuckin' with Pee
I spent more nights illin' less nights chillin'
The more shots they hold the better they feel it
What be the dealizz
Some killas like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespectin' the rest
Or so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be burstin' off guns like a vietnam vet
On the steps
Sittin' in the staircase bent
Thinkin' on ways to take another man's head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips
Switch clothes after I spit
Put niggas back in they place for shit that's on the mind kid
