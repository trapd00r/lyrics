I know how you make love
That's how I know that you have loved
And now you follow me around
To appear at the most inconvenient time

Like desire it's hard
To think straight for each part
It's nothing that can be declined
But you appear at a most inconvenient time

We say hi, we say goodbye
While I watch you in the corner of my eye
That's how you follow me around
It can happen anytime
Somehow you're always around
To appear at the most inconvenient time

That's how you follow me around
It can happen anytime
Somehow you're always around
To appear at the most inconvenient time
