[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Now you know I got patience
Be my night nurse; I'm the patient
I just need a little medication
If you makin' juice, I won't waste it; I mean that
Kick back, open up the sunroof
Feel the cool breeze; mic check, one, two
Oh lord, finna drink away the pain
I'm high and I need to be entertained
You fuckin' with a winner, I ain't with the game
No traffic; I'm in my own lane
Shake down dirty red queen, lord...

[Hook: Lorde (sample)]
We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue
We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue
But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
They know I got a short fuse
Stay strapped, top gun, Tom Cruise
Ten chicks in the car, that's a car pool
Left Bad Boy, I'm doin' what I want to
Roll one, smoke one, if you want
I'm a put you niggas on what I'm on to
New shit, watch this, fly shit
High life, toxic, my shit
Team winnin', no use for the cheat code
I'm a G, law to the G code
Fired up, take a ride up
Let them chicks know I got stacks for the freak show
How a champion's supposed to look
Check the numbers; ya'll could check the books
Floridian girl; California dreams; New York hustle
I live to hustle, lord...

[Hook/Outro: Lorde (sample)]
We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my...

I know we're not everlasting
We're a trainwreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still, get still
