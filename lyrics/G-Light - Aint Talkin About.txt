Underground is where you'll find us, a couple'a grinders
Tryin' to find our way out and put this darkness behind us
And underground is my oration, sound integration
But situation is we're surrounded by light negation

It's black as pitch 'cause we're trapped by our violent souls
In a deep mine, where deep rhymes won't keep my self-control
Too many foes, we feel snakebit, and we won't take it
Enemies need their face hit, we goin' ape shit!

[Chorus]

Hell is my confinement within this mine
Now trapped and enshrined by my own mind

Shoot through these tunnels and keep it movin', no knuckle draggin'
It's like a jungle, et cetera; keep ziggin' and zaggin'
These lizards ready to fire, military attire
Heaters, cannons, entire arsenals, bangers for hire

We only got double barrels, but we don't monkey wit 'em
Just throw shots and we hit 'em, to this industrial rhythm
Still searchin' for the light, still more to fight
Still at war with our plight, but still we're sure of our own collective might

[Chorus]

Hell is my confinement within this mine
Now trapped and enshrined by my own mind
Hell is my confinement within this mine
No way out, we're running out of time

Time to get fractious, we practice guerilla tactics
Magilla G's can't match this, so why they tryin' to attack us?
I'm a Bad Boy like Diddy, but I ain't talkin' Sean John
'Cause it's on like Son of Kong, gots to get our chimp on

That means we simply simulate simians simultaneously
And all y'all snakes beastin' to kill us is livin' dangerously
Straight bananas, it's the conflict these opponents hand us
So battle status, in these catacombs we got no manners

[Bridge]

All I know is pain, to give the same
All I have ingrained is hate
Misery of shame forever will remain
So I must regain my fate

This all seems endless, threats come relentless in this zoo
No one defends us, and they won't commend us when we're through
It don't matter, 'cause I'm after something resembling peace
I get madder every other day that this shit don't cease

Since our conception, downward has been my life's direction
Had no protection from evil factions and predilections
Heart of a killer, fo' rilla, pillar of coffin-fillers
Nothin' vanilla 'bout us two thrill-a-minute gorillas

Our main position this mission is to improve conditions
And it's our own volition, we ain't looking for permission
Vanish from opposition like we're magicians
In addition, our plan to see freedom's light comes to fruition

[Chorus]

Hell is my confinement within this mine
Now trapped and enshrined by my own mind
Hell is my confinement within this mine
No way out, we're running out of time

We ain't takin' it
We goin' ape shit
We ain't takin' it
Yeah, we goin' ape shit

We goin' ape shit
We goin' ape shit
We goin' ape shit
