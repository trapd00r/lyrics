We've been here before
We're stuck and I'm halfway trough your door
I've said it before
Listen, this is the last time
we won't fool ourselves no more
Been at it for days
We are brand new but we're already set in our ways
I find it hard to believe
we fall to pieces way too easily

Got our hands on the action
we've been trying really hard to find
Since we got stuck on all the love and affection
It's getting harder for us every time
I wonder why
we have to tell each other lies
Maybe our heartache never dies with the hot night crash
You'll hear it tonight

Some call it doubts
Too hard to tell me it's all over and out
In the back of my head
I heard you say it
Tried to beat you to it instead
Wish I could be sure that we don't work
Could I leave you and all your . . .
Halfway trough the door
My eyes shut my shoes nailed to the floor

Got our hands on the action
we've been trying really hard to find
Since we got stuck on all the love and affection
It's getting harder for us every time
I wonder why
we have to tell each other lies
Maybe our heartache never dies with the hot night crash
You'll hear it tonight

Give us something worth saving when we're done crying
This time I couldn't keep him and I wasn't trying
Oh baby drop your worrying it's over
and no we don't need only time to recover

Got our hands on the action
we've been trying really hard to find
Since we got stuck on all the love and affection
It's getting harder for us every time
I wonder why
we have to tell each other lies
Maybe our heartache never dies with the hot night crash
You'll hear it tonight
we have to tell each other lies
Maybe our heartache never dies with the hot night crash
You'll hear it tonight
