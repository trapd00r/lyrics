You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

CHORUS:
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I have a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

CHORUS
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
You and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream (I miss your love)
Someday you and me (Mm, mm)
Will find ourselves in love again

Fading:
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again...
