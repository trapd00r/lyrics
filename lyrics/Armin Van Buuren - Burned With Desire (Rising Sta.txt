For each forgotten kiss
For all the memories
For all the times a look
Said all we had to say
You played your part so well, a modern Romeo
You came on cupid's wings
And then you flew away

When you touch my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire
When you touch my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire
But you left me in the rain

For every sleepless night
Forever in your arms
For every hour spent
Lost in the revery
You broke your promises
No shame and no regrets
You burned the bridges too
An endless mystery

When you touch my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire
When you touch my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire
But you left me in the rain

When you touch my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire
When you touch my face
When you call my name
I'm burned with desire
But you left me in the rain
