We be stuntin' on these bitches
Get money on these bitches
250 on the wrist nigga we be the illest
We be the realest
See 'em be niggaz
Up-town soldier with the money to the ceiling
Shinnin' like a diamond from an eagle to a pigeon
Birds on the wire a hundred deep and we chillen

Finger on the trigger that's the up-town livin'
High o the sky no doubt we livin'
Hustlin' doin' donuts in the lamb
Candy on the slam
50 on the air
Hundred at the crib
Get it how ya live
Stuntin' on these bitches red diamonds how I feel
