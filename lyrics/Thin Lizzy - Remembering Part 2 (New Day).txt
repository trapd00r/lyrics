And I could wait and watch you
See it all unwind
And I could wait and look at you
See you change your mind
And I could even look into your eyes
See them hypnotize

Well, even though I'd enjoyed it
The truth to tell
Kid, I've got to leave
Those scenes behind

Here I go into a new day
Here I go into a new way

When you stood in that shady doorway
And you winked your wicked eye
And I looked at you in wide eyed wonder
You smiled, and said "Hi"

Just like you did woman
With that groovy guy that just passed by
Well, even though I adored you the truth to tell
Kid, I've got to leave those scenes behind

Here I go into a new day
Here I go into a new way

I guess I could call you my woman
But freedom I need
So down that road I'll be walking
Got to have time and space to breathe

Even though I loved you
The truth I've got to tell
I enjoyed every moment
But kid, you know darned well I've got to leave

Here I go into a new day
Here I go into a new way
