Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
Where's Mama?
She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin':
It's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama she's one of those types of women
Who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it
And don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle?
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times

There's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Na)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her in time out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out
I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba?
Take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga
Humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
You're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us (sung)

Wake up sleepy head we're here
Before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear
That's why you can't get her to wake
But don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock?
We'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of three
One, two, three... weeeeeeeeee
There goes mama splashin' in the water
No more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order
No more step dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her
We'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us (sung)
