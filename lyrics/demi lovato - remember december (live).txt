I feel a separation coming on 
cause i know you want 
To be moving on

I wish it would snow tonight 
You pull me in, avoid a fight 
Cause I feel 
A separation coming on 

Just prove that there is nothing left to try 
Cause the truth 
I rather we just both deny

You kiss me with those open eyes 
It says so much 
It's no surprise to you 
But I've got something left to say 

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender 
Please remember,remember December 
We where so in love back then 
Now your listening 
To what they say 
Don't go that way 
Remember, remember, December 
Please remember 
Don't surrender

You said you wouldn't let them change your mind 
Cause when together fire melts the ice  
Our hearts are both on overdrive 
Come with me let's run tonight don't let 
These memories get left behind 

Don't surrender,surrender, December 
Please remember, remember, December 
Where were so in love back then 
Now your listening 
To what they say 
Don't go that way 
Remember,remember,December 
Please remember 

I remember us together 
We both promised that forever 
We could do this 
fight the pressure 
Please remember December 

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender 
Please remember, remember, December 
We where so in love back then 
Now your listening 
To what they say 
Don't go that way 
Remember, remember, December 
Please remember 
Don't surrender
