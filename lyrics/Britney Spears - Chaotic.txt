There's too much of this noise boy
Let's get a seat
So you can talk sweet to me
I see these other boys
Won't you meet me at the dancefloor?
Maybe like to buy me drinks
Who's the sexy guy and I wonder why
We could have some fun
So don't be shy
Baby just enjoy what's on your mind?
Party and have a good time

It's getting chaotic
I'm rocking and rolling, no stopping
We going until it's over
Do you like the way I rock it
Boy I think it's so chaotic

Oh, I'm wild ah, I'm on fire
Turning at the dancefloor
Turn it up higher, wild like a tiger
Tell me do you want more
Everybody blink your lights
Party from the left to right
Oh, I'm on fire

Turning at the dancefloor
