(Til Tuesday - Voices Carry)

In the dark, I like to read his mind
But I'm frightened of the things I might find
Oh, there must be something he's thinking of
To tear him away
When I tell him that I'm falling in love
Why does he say

Hush hush keep it down now voices carry
Hush hush keep it down now voices carry

I try so hard not to get upset
Because I know all the trouble I'll get
Oh, he tells me tears are something to hide
And something to fear
And I try so hard to keep it inside
So no one can hear

Hush hush keep it down now voices carry 
Hush hush keep it down now voices carry
Hush hush keep it down now voices carry

(Welcome To The Jungle - Guns N' Roses)

Oh, I wanna hear you scream

And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down
Yeah, down!

(mixed, lol)

Hush hush keep it down now voices carry 
Hush hush keep it down now voices carry
(welcome to jungle)
Hush hush keep it down now voices carry
(welcome to jungle)
Hush hush keep it down now voices carry
(welcome to jungle)
Hush hush keep it down now voices carry
(welcome to jungle)

It's gonna bring you down, huh!
