OK(ok,ok)
Guess who's back(back,back),
Back again(gain,gain),
Shady's back(back,back),
Tell a friend(friend,friend),
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!

Now everyone report to the dancefloor, to the dance floor, to the dancefloor,
Now everyone report to the dancefloor, alright stop!........Pajama time!

Come here little kiddies, on my lap, guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of Child investigate and accusate.
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys,
what else could I possibly do to make noise?
I may've touched on everything but little boys.
that's not a stab at Michael,
that's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho,
I go a little bit crazy sometimes,
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes.

Good God, dip, do a little slide, bend down, touch your toes and just glide,
up the center of the dancefloor, like TP for my bunghole,
and it's cool if you let one go,
nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little 'poot poot' it's OK!
(fart sound), oops!, my CD just skipped, and everyone just heard you let one rip!

(chorus)

Now, I'm going to make you dance,
It's your chance,
Yeah, boy, shake that ass,
Oops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl,
Girl you know your my world
Alright, now lose it!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Just lose it!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Go crazy!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Oh, baby,
AAA!
Oh, baby, baby(AAA!)

It's Friday, and it's my day,
just to party all the way to Sunday,
Maybe till Monday,
I don't know what day,
Everyday's just a holiday.
Cruising down the freeway,
Feeling kinda' breezy,
put the top down,
Let my hair blow,
I don't know where I'm going,
All I know is,
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body.

Excuse me, Miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk,
But I'm feeling just a little stressed out from work,
could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair,
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eye out (yeah!).
what's your name, girl?
What's your sign?
(DRE) Man, you must be up out your mind!
DRE! AAA! Beer goggels, blind,
I'm just tryin to unwind 

(chorus)

Now, I'm going to make you dance,
It's your chance,
Yeah, boy, shake that ass,
Oops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl,
Girl you know your my world
Alright, now lose it!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Just lose it!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Go crazy!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Oh, baby,
AAA!
Oh, baby, baby(AAA!)

It's Tuesday, and I'm locked up,
I'm in jail, and I don't know what happened,
They say I was running butt naked,
Down the street screamin'
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Well I'm sorry,I don't remember,
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty,
They said save it, cuz we've got you on tape,
Yelling at an old lady, 'Touch my body'!!!

Now, this is the part where the rap breaks down,
gets real intense,
No-one makes a sound,
Everything looks like it's 8 mile now,
The beat comes back and everybody loses themselves,
Snap back to reality,
Look it's B Rabbit!
You signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man!
chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba!! 
I don't have any lines to go right here, so,
tubba Tellytubbie
Fella's (What?), 
Fella's, Grab your left nut, and make your right one jealous! (What??)

Black girls,
White girls,
Skinny girls,
Fat girls,
Tall girls,
Small girls,
I'm calling all girls!

Everyone, report to the dancefloor,
It's your chance for,
A little romance or,
Butt squeezing,
It's the season,
Just go AAAA!
It's so appealing!

(chorus)

Now, I'm going to make you dance,
It's your chance,
Yeah, boy, shake that thing,
Oops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl,
Girl you know your my world
Alright, now lose it!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Just lose it!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Go crazy!
AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! 
Oh, baby,
AAA!
Oh, baby, baby(AAA!)

Um, num, num, num touch my body,
Um, num, num, num touch my body,
Ooh, boy, just touch my body,
I mean girl just touch my body(body,body)
