I'm so young and you're so old
This, my darling, I've been told
I don't care just what they say
'Cause forever I will pray

You and I, we will be as free
As the birds up in the trees
Oh, please stay by me, Diana

Thrills I get when you hold me close
Oh, my darling, you're the most
I love you, but do you love me?
Oh, Diana, can't you see

I love you with all my heart
And I hope we will never part
Oh, please stay by me, Diana

Oh, my darling, oh, my lover
Tell me that there is no other
I love you with my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, don't you know I love you so

Only you can take my heart
Only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you giving all your charms

Hold me, darling, hold me tight
Squeeze me baby with-a all your might
Oh, please stay by me, Diana
Oh, please, Diana
Oh, please, Diana
Oh, please, Diana
