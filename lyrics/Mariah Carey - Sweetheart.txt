Uh, ha
What you thinkin' about?
You and me goin' one-on-one (say what)
JD y'all (uh huh, So So Def)
MC y'all (what you think about)
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (c'mon)
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

Boy, haven't you noticed (say what)
The gleam in my eyes (uh, huh)
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized (yeah)
But every time you're with me (uh)
Feel so positive
That with you a little love
Somethings gotta give

A full moon is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon you will come to be my light
Here we are
Hoping that we'll never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart)
We can share a story book moment
What you think about
What you think about
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one
Just deep in love

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart)
We can share a story book moment
What you think about
What you think about
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one
Just deep in love


You ain't no Casanova (ha, ha, ha)
I know that you'll be true
And that's why (uh)
I'm so in love with you (me, too)
But this romantic evening
You led me at my door (yeah, yeah)
But tonight, I'd like to explore


A full moon is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon you will come to be my light

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (putcha hand in the air)

JD y'all
MC y'all
See, I saw you at the party
With your eyes on me
Fittin' the description
On what I want my wife to be (ha, ha)
As live as me
Don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of style
And usin' wild name like Ivory
I agree with my niggas
You the baddest
I ever seen in a long time (uh)
But woman with her own shine
Is her own time
And I don't hit
'Cause I'm tired of dealin'
With the wrong kind
Getting non' but the bull****
She got a playa
Tryin' to think of new things to say (sup, baby)
She up in the corner
Sippin' Don P, Rosee' (yeah)
Shakin' it up with the homegirls
Payin' no attention to us
They in they own world
'Hey, yo, girl'
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything you see in your dreams
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

Sounds so right (uh, huh)
The mood is right
Say what
MC, baby, sing it to me
To keep me warm
Away from home
Nowhere better than my baby's arms
Sounds so right (uh, huh)
The mood is right
Say what
MC, baby, sing it to me To keep me warm
Away from home
C'mon, baby, you can be my
Won't you be my
Sweetheart
