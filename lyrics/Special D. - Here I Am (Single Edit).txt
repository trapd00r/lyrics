Here I am,
My brand new track,
I made it 'cause you want me back,
It's time for me, but it took a while,
We're singin' all, in a possible style,
I want my rave in generation,
Around the world across the nation,
That's what I love, my brand new track,
Put your hands up, Special D. is back!

Radio play my music loud
I will turn you inside out!
