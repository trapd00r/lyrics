She's the kind of girl
Who'll smash herself down in the night
She's the kind of girl
Who'll fracture her mind till it's light

She'll break her own heart
And you know
That she'll break your heart too
So darling, let go of her hand

She's been skipping days
Spilling her drinks in the sink
And you know
She never coming home
Never coming home a-again

But when, when, when
She open her eyes, eyes, eyes
Beyond the chipping paint
Through the windowpane
Lies, lies, lies
Her patron saint, broken and lame
And absolutely insane
For learning that true love exists

So darling, let go of her hand
Let go of her hand, let go of her hand
Let go of her hand, let go of her hand
Let go of her hand, let go of her hand

You'll be to blame
For playing this game
And learning that true love exists

She's the kind of girl
Who'll smash herself down in the night
She the kind of girl
Who'll fracture her mind till it's light

She'll break her own heart
And you know
That she'll break your heart too
So darling, let go of her hand
Darling, let go of her hand

You'll be to blame
For playing this game
And learning that true love exists
Broken and lame
And knowing that true love exists
The pain, the pain, the pain
Of knowing that true love exists

Doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo, doo-doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo-ooh, doo-doo-doo
Ah-da-da, ah-ah
