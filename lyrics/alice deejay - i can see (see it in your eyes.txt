I can see it in your eyes (eyes)

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes it feels so nice
I can tell, my love is strong
Touch me now you are the one

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes it feels so nice
I can tell, I love you
Over & over & over again

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes it feels so nice
I can tell, my love is strong
Touch me now you are the one

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes it feels so nice
I can tell, I love you
Over & over & over & over (& over)

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever makes you cry
Whatever it takes to hold you
My dream is still alive

Everytime I see you laughin'
Everytime you're passin' by
Everytime I hear you talkin'
I'm feelin' something in the sky

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes it feels so nice
I can tell, my love is strong
Touch me now you are the one

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes it feels so nice
I can tell, I love you
Over & over & over & over (& over)

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever makes you cry
Whatever it takes to hold you
My dream is still alive

Everytime I see you laughin'
Everytime your passin' by
Everytime I hear you talkin'
I'm feelin' something in the sky
