You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound
Pushed around refugee
Something's wrong
Got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from outer space
Out of place like King Kong

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing

I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Like a doll
Like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk
How to walk, how to fall
Can't complain
I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control
Lost my hold, it's insane

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing

I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Look this way
Just a little smile
Is what they say
You look better on the photograph 
If you laugh, that's okay!!

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing

I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound
Pushed around refugee
