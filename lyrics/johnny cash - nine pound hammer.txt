Well this nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size honey
For my size 
I'm goin' on the mountain gonna see my baby 
And I ain't comin' back Lord I ain't comin' back 
Oh roll on buddy don't you roll so slow how can I go when my wheels won't roll 
Roll on buddy pull a load o'coal how can I go when my wheels won't roll 

Well it's a long way to Harlem it's a long way to Hazard 
Just to get a little brew just to get a little brew 
Now when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone 
Out of number nine coal out of number nine coal 
Roll on buddy...
