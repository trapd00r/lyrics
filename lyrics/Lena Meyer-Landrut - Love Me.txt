So many places where I could go to
But I don't go because I don't want to
So many faces that I could see
But I don't look because I don't give a shit

You say to me that I'm good for you
But I'm not sure if I want you to
But if you're hot we could give it a try
So many things to do before we die

But as long as you'll love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you would love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

So many flames that I could have lighted
But I don't light because I'm too excited
So many games that I could have played
But I don't play because I don't give a shit

You say to me that I'm good for you
But I'm not sure if I want you to
But if you're hot we could give it a try
So many things to do before we die

But as long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you would love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

I would go
I would, uh, go
I would go (ahahaha)
I, uh, would go

You say to me that I'm good for you
But I'm not sure if I want you to
But if you're hot we could give it a try
So many things to do before we die

But as long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

As long as you will love me
I will still love you
But if you don't love me I will go

ahahaha
