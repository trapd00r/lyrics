Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
Woah-oh-oh
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
Woah-oh-oh

Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told who I should do it with
To keep both my hands above the blan-blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
Woah-oh-oh
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
Woah-oh-oh

Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-Shame on me (shame on me)
To need release (to need release)
Un-un-uncontrollably (un-control-lably-lably-lably-la-blee-blee-lably)

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt I got running through my mind
Woah-oh-oh
