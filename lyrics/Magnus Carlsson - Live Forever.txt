Aahh 
Aahh 
Aahh, ah 

I will live forever 
If you always keep me in your mind 
And it doesn't matter 
How far I am 
If I ever leave you 
I'm gonna be there by your side 
If you ever need me 
Well, here I am 

I'm gonna live forever 
Don't you ever forget 
That all the stars in heaven 
Will shine for me 
I'm gonna live forever 
No never forget 
That no one's lost in heaven's 
Eternity 

Hold the fire burning
Life was never meant to be the end 
There's no way I'm turning
By accident 
I don't need to prove it 
I'm just ready for another stair
Though my heart is moving
My soul is hear

I'm gonna live forever 
Don't you ever forget 
That all the stars in heaven 
Will shine for me 
I'm gonna live forever 
No never forget 
That no one's lost in heaven's 
Eternity 

In everyone...
Goes on and on...

I'm gonna live forever 
Don't you ever forget 
That all the stars in heaven 
Will shine for me 
I'm gonna live forever 
No never forget 
That no one's lost in heaven's 
Eternity 

Aahh, aahh, aahh 

(I'm gonna live forever)
(Don't you ever forget)
(That all the stars in heaven)
(Will shine for me)
I'm gonna live forever 
No never forget 
That no one's lost in heaven's 
Eternity
