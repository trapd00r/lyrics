I knew a boy, he came from the sea
He was the only boy who ever knew the truth about me.

I'm overwhelmed & undersexed.
Oh baby what did you expect?
I'm over wrought & so disgraced
I'm too ashamed to show my face.

& they're coming to take me away now
& what I want I will never have
I'm on the Pacific Coast Highway
With your gun in my hands.

Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands
Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands.

I knew a boy, he left me so damaged
Do you even know the extent, what you ravaged
All this world's shame won't stop my arrival
& all this world's fame, drugs, plague, won't stop my survival.

I'm bloodied & totally bound
I don't know what to do with my hands now
I surrender, I give in
I'll kick down your door if you don't let me in
& I lost myself completely
I look to you my shooting star
I'm on the Pacific Coast Highway.
My God how did you fall so hard?

Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands
Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands.

& you know, I'm drownin'.
& you know, I'm drownin'.

& miles & miles of regrets
It hasn't happened & it won't happen, yeah
& days & days of perfect sex & bad TV
Oh I just try to forget
& miles & miles, of regrets
& miles & miles, of regrets.

Pacific Coast Highway, So fast
Pacific Coast Highway, I crashed
Pacific Coast Highway, Anguish
Pacific Coast Highway, You better live
Pacific Coast Highway.
