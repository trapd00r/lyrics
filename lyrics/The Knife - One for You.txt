Rumours telling me you are mourning
and you haven't slept for several days.
You've been turning inside out looking for reasons
and your black sorry eyes made you pale.

And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't  be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't  be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.

If we say that there is something above the mountains
if we say that there is something we can't see.
Promise you will never believe me
cause I guess I'm just trying to make it easy

And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't  be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't  be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.

Everybody was laughing when they found us
one for you and one for me.
Then they let us go to hunt us down again
and still you refuse to see
why everything has to stay ugly

Rumours telling me you are mourning
and you haven't slept for several days.
You've been turning inside out looking for reasons
and your black sorry eyes made you pale.

And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't  be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
And you couldn't catch them
you couldn't  be there.
You couldn't help them at all,
and it was cold,
and it was cold.
