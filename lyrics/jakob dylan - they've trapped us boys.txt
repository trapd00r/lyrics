Gentlemen where have we been?
Can't find the whole where we got in
We ain't had no letters since spring
Gentlemen where have we been?
Ain't going nowhere now
Let this bottle make its rounds
And let this liquor settle down
We ain't going nowhere now

Darker than ever in the mine
Shine a light, shine a light
Holler back now make some noise
I do believe they've trapped us boys

Fill the dirt back on the grave
Ain't nothing good here being raised
Look at the filthy mess we've made
Fill the dirt back on the grave

We cut the fruit, we took the tree
We chiseled all the branches free
We took more than we'd ever need
We cut the fruit, we took the tree

Darker than ever in the mine
Shine a light, shine a light
Holler back now make some noise
I do believe they've trapped us boys

Can't have no one not toe the line
'Round here it's always 'round midnight
Can't have no brothers left behind
Can't have no one not toe the line

That ain't the cavalry we heard
It's the rain that's crashing on the earth
Tell our women and our children we ain't hurt
But no it ain't the cavalry we heard

Darker than ever in the mine
Shine a light, shine a light
Holler back now make some noise
I do believe they've trapped us boys
