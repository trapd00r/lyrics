[Korean:]

가진 게 꿈밖에 없었네
눈 뜨면 뿌연 아침뿐
밤새 춤을 추며 노래해
그 끝이 없던 악보들

Ay 우린 호기롭게 shout
'다 던져봐'
세상과 첫 싸움
Don't wanna die
But so much pain
Too much cryin'
So 무뎌지는 칼날

Oh I
We were only seven
I
But we have you all now
일곱의 겨울과 봄 뒤에
이렇게 맞잡은 손끝에
Oh I
Yeah we got to heaven

내게 돌을 던져
우린 겁이 없어 anymore
We are we are together bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
또 겨울이 와도
누가 날 막아도 걸어가
We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)

We are bullet bullet bulletproof
부정적인 시선에 맞서 우린 해냈구
나쁜 기억도 많은 시련도
다 호기롭게 우린 막아냈지 bulletproof

늘 생각해
아직 꿈속인 건 아닐까
길었던 겨울
끝에 온 게 진짜 봄일까
모두 비웃던
한땐 부끄럽던 이름
이건 쇠로 된 증명
"Bullet-proof".

Oh I
We were only seven
I
But we have you all now
일곱의 겨울과 봄 뒤에
이렇게 맞잡은 손끝에
Oh I
Yeah we got to heaven

내게 돌을 던져
우린 겁이 없어 anymore
We are we are together bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
또 겨울이 와도
누가 날 막아도 걸어가
We are we are forever bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)

Oh oh
다신 멈추지 않을래
여기 우리가 함께이기에
Tell me your every story
Tell me why you don't stop this
Tell me why you still walkin'
Walkin' with us
(Yeah we got to heaven)

[English translation:]

We had nothing but dreams
Nothing but foggy mornings when we opened our eyes
We stayed up all night to dance and sing
The endless music sheets

Ay, we bravely shout
"Throw all you have"
First fight with the world
Don't wanna die
But so much pain
Too much cryin'
So blunted blades

Oh, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
We were only seven
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
But we have you all now
After seven winters and springs
At the tips of our entwined fingers
Oh I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, we got to heaven

Throw stones at me
We don't fear anymore
We are we are together, bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
Even if winter comes again
Even if I'm blocked off, I will still walk
We are we are forever, bulletproof
(Yeah, we got to heaven)

We are bullet-bullet-bulletproof
We faced the negative looks and did it
Bad memories, numerous trials
We bravely blocked them all, bulletproof

I always think
Am I still in a dream?
Is it really spring
That came after the long winter?
The name that everyone laughed at
That was once embarrassing
This is the iron proof
"Bullet-proof"

Oh, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
We were only seven
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
But we have you all now
After seven winters and springs
At the tips of our entwined fingers
Oh I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, we got to heaven

Throw stones at me
We don't fear anymore
We are we are together, bulletproof
(Yeah we have you have you)
Even if winter comes again
Even if I'm blocked off, I will still walk
We are we are forever, bulletproof
(Yeah, we got to heaven)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I will never stop again
For we are together here
Tell me your every story
Tell me why you don't stop this
Tell me why you still walkin'
Walkin' with us
(Yeah we got to heaven)

Throw stones at me
We don't fear anymore
We are, we are together bulletproof
(Yeah, we have you, have you)
Even if winter comes again
Even if I'm blocked off, I will still walk
We are, we are forever, bulletproof
(Yeah we got to heaven)

(Yeah, we have you, have you)
Yeah we are not seven, with you
Yeah we are not seven, with you
Yeah we are not seven, with you
