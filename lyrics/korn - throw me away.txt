Flesh wound, flesh wound
With medication it will fade
Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray
Love, full of hate.
Don't you love how I break?

Don't let them throw me away
Aha!
Keep me and I'll be okay
Aha!
Skipping a beat but it plays
Aha!
Don't let them throw me away
Aha!
Don't let them throw me away

Screwed up, used up
Crumpled lying on the floor
Fucked-up, shut up
All you did back then was score
I'm feeling weak
Missing parts
Incomplete.

Don't let them throw me away
Aha!
Keep me and I'll be okay
Aha!
Skipping a beat but it plays
Aha!
Don't let them throw me away
Aha!
Don't let them throw me away

Hold me up into the light
Fix the cracks and fix them right
Keep the pieces in the drawer
Keep them there for ever more
May come in use for someday
Recycle this shit in someway
And all that I have to say
Is don't let them throw me away.

Don't let them throw me away
Aha!
Keep me and I'll be okay
Aha!
Skipping a beat but it plays
Aha!
Don't let them throw me away
Aha!
Don't let them throw me away
(almost silent) Away... [until end]
