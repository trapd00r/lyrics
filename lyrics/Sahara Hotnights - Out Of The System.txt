Gotta love it or leave it while you can
Get ready to beat it, make a stand
Nothing's alright, it doesn't turn me on
Tell me aren't you scared to end up all alone?

We can't take it anymore
We cannot fake it any more

Get out of the system 
Into the streets
There are more than a million ways
To get out of the system 
Up on your feet
Come on, it's getting late

Can't hear your voice, can't see your hand
So hard to breathe, stuck in their command
They screw it up, I'm not surprised
Still have to make it through another night
