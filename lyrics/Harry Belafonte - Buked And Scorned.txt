I've been buked and I've been scorned
I've been buked and I've been scorned
Children, I've been buked and I've been scorned
Tryin' to make this journey all alone

You may talk about me sure as you please
Talk about me sure as you please
Children, talk about me sure as you please
Your talk will never drive me down to my knees

Jesus died to set me free
Jesus died to set me free
Children, Jesus died to set me free
Nailed to that cross on Calvary

I've been buked and I've been scorned
I've been buked and I've been scorned
Children, I've been buked and I've been scorned
Tryin' to make this journey all alone
