Once I was a prisoner
Lost inside myself
With the world surrounding me
Wandering through the misery
But now I am, yeah free

You gave me a breath of life
Unclouded my eyes
With a sweet serenity
Lighting a ray of hope for me
And now I am free

Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine
Free to give
Free to love
Free enough to fly

Oh
Once I was so all alone
Unsteady and cold
But your love rained down upon me
Washing away uncertainty yea, yeah

Now, now, now
I am free
I am free
Oh yeah, free
Oh yeah, free
