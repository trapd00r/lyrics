Possibly maybe probably love

Possibly maybe probably love


Since we broke up

I'm using lipstick again

I'll suck my tongue

In remembrance of you


Possibly maybe probably love

Possibly maybe probably love


Mon petit vulcan

You're eruptions and disasters

I keep calm

Admiring the lava

I keep calm


Possibly maybe probably love

Possibly maybe probably love


Electric shocks?

I love them

With you dozen a day

But after a while I wonder

Where's that love you promised me?

Where is he ?


Possibly maybe probably love

Possibly, poss-


How can you offer

Where's that love you

Where's that love you promised me?

Where is he ?


Possibly maybe


How can you offer me love like that?

My heart's burned

How can you offer me love like that?

I'm exhausted

Leave me alone


Possibly maybe, Possibly maybe, Possibly maybe
