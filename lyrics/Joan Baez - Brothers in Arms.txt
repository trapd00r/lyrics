These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And that always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I have witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There are many different worlds
And a million different suns
But we have just one world
Why live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell and
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the stars above
And every line on your palm
We are fools to make war
On our brothers in arms
