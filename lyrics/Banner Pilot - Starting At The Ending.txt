Counting down the days 'till I'm with you
I cringe at words I say
I'm swimming with the sharks the workweek through
So I'm drowning come Friday

Reaching front door, turning on the radio
Walking to the liquor store
You're what I came here for
You're what I came here for

But I've got nothing left
A couple bucks, some cigarettes
I pick a day to say I'll quit
I'm filled with hope or full of shit

It doesn't really matter where I look
The directions seem the same
I'm closing out my nights with Fante books
If you're happy, then why change?

Reaching front door, turning on the radio
Walking to the liquor store
You're what I came here for
You're what I came here for

Counting up what's left
I let it ride on easy bets
Once I traded in free will
It got easy to keep still, to keep still

You're what I came here for
You're what I came here for
You're what I came here for
You're what I came here for

What's the point of anything?
What's the point of anything?
What's the point of anything?
What's the point of anything?
