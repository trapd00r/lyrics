Reality, reality, reality, is always
Reality, reality, reality, is always
Reality, reality, reality, is always
Reality, reality, reality, reality

You tattoed yourself what a piece of art
You've already broken your mother's heart
When I was your age working my ass off
Your generation's soft

Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's keeping her from searching

You cannot pierce that and
You're dressed too tight
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right
So dye your hair dad's goon wash it out
Come on wash your mouth

Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's hiding in the shadow

Reality, reality, reality, is always
Reality, reality, reality, is always
Reality, reality, reality, is always
Reality, reality, reality

Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's keeping her from searching

You cannot pierce that and
You're dressed too tight
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right
So dye your hair dad's goon wash it out
Come on wash your mouth

Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's keeping her from seaching

Reality is always such a drag
For barely blooming eighteens
The barely blooming eighteen
Wants to know
What's hiding in the shadow
