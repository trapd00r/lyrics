Doo di doo doo di doo...

Pick me up when I feel down
You're like the sunshine in the sky
You were fun to have around
Plain to see, I'm satisfied
People say, you're good to me
You're not wrong for loving me
Don't let me down
Kind of things bin in my life
No one knows where you compare
Gold that lies beneath the rainbow
Seems like things were never there
People say, you're good to me
You're not wrong for loving me
Don't let me down

Doo di doo doo di doo...

Pick me up when I feel down
You're like the sunshine in the sky
You were fun to have around
Plain to see, I'm satisfied
People say, you're good to me
You're not wrong for loving me
Don't let me down

Doo doo doo doo...
