I don't gotta rap
I can sell a mill' sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
Niggas say we lost it
So I'ma bring it back
I love the dirty dirty
Cuz niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit
I watch 'em get it on the floor
And if you need it hyphy
I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town
They do it any day
Compton to Hollywood
As soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in the low-low
I do it the Cali way
And when I hit the Chi'
People say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress
They like my -- my attire
They love how I move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply...

Catch me on the block
Every other day
Another person, another drop
16 bars, 24 a pop
44 songs, nigga gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars
Push 'em off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what you need -- you know I get â€˜em by the flock
I call my homie black. 
Meet me on the Ave.
I hit Wash Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spinners
See my pimpin' never dragged
Find me wit' different women you niggas never had
For those who say they know me
Know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean 
The way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot my nigga this is what I mean

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why

Shorty see the drop
Ask me what I paid and I say yeah I paid a guap
And then I hit the switch
That take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop
They hop in the car
I tell them all aboard
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train 
And I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em, man, they tell me that's their song
They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck and compliments the arm 
Which compliments the ear
Then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare
Then niggas start to hate
Rearrange their face
But little do they know I keep them things by waist-side
I reply: 
Nobody gotta die
Similar to Li'l Weezy cuz I got that fire
