Can you truly love a woman?
Madly, deeply

No longer are we teenagers
No longer hanging round the corner playing games with our friends
Sometimes we all get outrageous
We can be dirty, can be crazy, can be flirty and cool

Truly, madly, deeply
Louder baby, louder baby

W-O-M-A-N
Can you truly love a woman? (Louder baby, louder baby)
W-O-M-A-N
Be independent like a woman

The early years were a lesson
Now we know what's goin' on, we're standing strong on our feet
And now we're industry players
We're wearing G-strings, taking meetings, fitting music to beats

Truly, madly, deeply
Louder baby, louder baby

W-O-M-A-N
Can you truly love a woman? (Louder baby, louder baby)
W-O-M-A-N
Be independent like a woman (Madly, deeply, yeah)

So happy now (so happy)
Living in a fantasy we built for us today (so very happy now)
So happy now
Being every woman that we wanted to be, louder baby

Be independent like a woman (Louder baby, louder baby)
