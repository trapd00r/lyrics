Well that was easy, waiting
Everything's easy now
And the days are oh so normal

But oh baby how I miss you
Oh, baby how I miss you
Oh, baby how I miss you now
Now... n-n-n-now...

I used to lock myself in your bathroom
Swallowing the Codeine kept for your back
Numb, so numb
I'd let your words come and come

Ooh
So come
Come on, come
Come on kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
'Cause I'm leaving you now

That was easy, but how I miss you
That was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, but how I miss you now
Now... n-n-n-now

I watched you clean the filth off your phone dial
Swallowing things your finger picked up
Tongue, your tongue
I'd watch your tongue licking on

Ooh
So come
Come on tongue
Come on kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
'Cause I'm leaving you now
