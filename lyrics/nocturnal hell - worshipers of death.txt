One two fuck you! 

Your time is coming, coming fast 
Shadow of death will take you last 
Casting it’s shadow over you 
Taking lives is what it will do 

Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Screaming and gasping, take your last breath 
Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Your body and soul it will infest 

Now you’re dead and in a box 
Shadow of death is sly as a fox 
No more life and no more you 
He won’t stop till he’s through 

Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Screaming and gasping, take your last breath 
Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Your body and soul it will infest 

World is over, world is done 
Shadow of death has had his fun 
Shadow of death takes his leave 
No more world for him to deceive 

Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Screaming and gasping, take your last breath 
Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Your body and soul it will infest 

One two fuck you 

Your time is coming, coming fast 
Shadow of death will take you last 
Casting it’s shadow over you 
Taking lives is what it will do 

Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Screaming and gasping, take your last breath 
Now you have entered the shadow of death 
Your body and soul it will infest
