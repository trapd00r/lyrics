Cherry, cherry, kills, kills

Thought that cupid shot me with love
It was only an arrow
Just 'cause we ain't deep doesn't mean
We can't enjoy the shallow

Never gonna make me want it
Make me want more than fun
If you wanna be the one
Be the one, just for now

But we're not in love, no matter what 
It's not enough, we're not in love
We're not in love, no matter what 
It's not enough, we're not in love
It's not enough, we're not in love
It's not enough, we're not in love

Staring at the stars
Got the lights dimmed to feel a connection
The stars above, staring at the stars above
Broke a couple hearts
But I'm not trying to start a collection
No we're not in love, honey, girls don't fall in love

Never gonna make me want it
Make me want more than fun
If you wanna be the one
Be the one, just for now

But we're not in love, no matter what 
It's not enough, we're not in love
We're not in love, no matter what 
It's not enough, we're not in love
It's not enough, we're not in love
It's not enough, we're not in love

In, trust me
We're not in, trust me
We're not in, trust me
We're not in, trust me

We're not in, trust me (Never gonna make me want it)
We're not in, trust me (Make me want more than fun)
We're not in, trust me (If you wanna be the one)
We're not in, trust me (Be the one, just for now)

It's not enough (Never gonna make me want it)
We're not in love (Make me want more than fun)
It's not enough (If you wanna be the one, be the one)
We're not in love
