Sorry baby sadly, I gave up I know
I was out of option, with nowhere left to go
I was much too young by then, baby just a kid
It just seems so stay that way no matter what I did

Oh let's say it
They're building walls around us now
Oh let's say it
They're building walls around us now

Now it seems by folded, I just tag along
When I found out what I did wrong, baby you were gone
I smile and shake my head at this, what else can I do
I keep on getting signs baby, I'll lead them back to you

Oh let's say it
They're building walls around us now
Oh let's say it
They're building walls around us now

It seems like I fell out of luck into the outstretched arms of fuck up, I know
It seems like I fell out of luck into the outstretched arms of fuck up, I know

Oh let's say it
They're building walls around us now
Oh let's say it
They're building walls around us now
