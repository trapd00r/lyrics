Ce-le-brate
Everybody ce-le-brate
Celebrate
Oh everybody everybody celebrate

Sitting in my mom's old minivan
Radio up haven't called me back
Living up the days of the "never gonna change"
Didn't stay like that
Hate to say it's been too long
Old school days I miss those old school songs

This is my throw
This is my throwback song
Its just like the ones (just like the ones)
The one that we used to know
This is the music that makes me better
This is the feeling that turns me on
Oh everybody's got that window down summertime turn it up sing-along

So, ce-le-brate
Everybody ce-le-brate
Ce-le-brate
Oh everybody everybody celebrate

Lying in my bed going what if what if
Well what if I just don't care
We all got the same heart beat beat beat beating gonna take you there
You do you (do you)
And I'll do me (do me)
I just miss the way we used to sing

This is my throw
This is my throwback song
Its just like the ones (just like the ones)
The one that we used to know
This is the music that makes me better
This is the feeling that turns me on
Oh everybody's got that window down summertime turn it up sing-along

So, so, ce-le-brate
Everybody ce-le-brate
Ce-le-brate
Oh everybody everybody celebrate

Ce-le-brate
Everybody ce-le-brate
Ce-le-brate
Oh everybody everybody celebrate

In the basement after dark
Truth or dare with Jimmy Clark
In the basement after dark
Truth or dare with Jimmy Clark

This is my throw
This is my throwback song
Its just like the ones (just like the ones)
The one that we used to know
This is the music that makes me better
This is the feeling that turns me on
Oh everybody's got that window down summertime turn it up sing-along

So, so, ce-le-brate
Everybody ce-le-brate
Ce-le-brate
Oh everybody everybody celebrate

So, so, ce-le-brate
Everybody ce-le-brate
