I can't breathe anymore
Why that is I'm not sure
I've got my feet on the ground
In fact I'm flat on the floor

My direction is lost
I should pause to take stock
It's a new one on me
To even dream that you're free

It's a tale without an end
But the end is there for all to see
And if the end weren't so real
Coming 'round and 'round again on me

I guess it's all about my pride
I want to be there at the kill
But with or without God on my side
I know that I really will
