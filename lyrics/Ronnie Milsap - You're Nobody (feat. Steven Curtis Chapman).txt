You say its so easy
Your feet barely touch the ground its all
Sunshine and breezy
You've never been lost but you found
Some secret you're not gonna share it
I've got news for you babe I'm already there

And you're nobody
Til you love somebody
Til you can make a promise to hold on tight
From the blue out of the morning til the dead of night
Oh you're nobody
Til you love somebody
And somebody loves you

I walked around lonely
Wondering who, what, where or when would I
Find my one and only
Who knew it was just around the bend
Oh I'd cry for joy cause there's so much more
And I'd laugh cause I know what I'm living for

And you're nobody (nobody)
Til you love somebody (somebody)
Til you can make a promise to hold on tight
From the blue out of the morning til the dead of night
Oh you're nobody (nobody)
Til you love somebody

You don't know
Til you go out on that limb
Til you do you haven't lived
Til you give yourself away, give yourself away

No you're nobody (nobody)
Til you love somebody (somebody)
Til you can make a promise you can finally keep
Til you know who you're praying for before you sleep
Oh you're nobody (nobody)
Til you love somebody
And somebody loves you (nobody)

Til you love somebody (somebody)
Til you can make a promise you can finally keep
Til you know who you're praying for before you sleep
Oh you're nobody (nobody)
Til you love somebody
And somebody loves you
