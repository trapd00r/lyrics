Shut your mouth
I'm spinning it tight down south
I'm on a raid, tie you down
'Cause, boy, I can save you from that evil faith

Eagles serve
Yeah, uh huh, Mother first
They turn you predator
But, boy, I can save you from that evil faith

Arms sold in balmy cities that may not be with us for long
Save you from that evil faith

Lay back
Strong black vine, submission is my mission for a
Strong black vine, you just might see that sweet Jesus
Strong black vine, submission is my mission for a
Strong black vine, your mission, concentrate

Blown to bits
Her innocent flesh to dust
All for a dark God
All for the love of some evil faith

Swollen stream
Every drip serpents bless
You rape Earth knowledge
Still she would save you from your evil faith

Bodies bathe in black gold your pleasure
Arms sold in balmy cities that may not be with us for long
Save you from that evil faith

Lay back
Strong black vine, submission is my mission for a
Strong black vine, you just might see that sweet Jesus
Strong black vine, submission is my mission for a
Strong black vine, your mission, con- concen-

Strong black vine, submission is my mission for a
Strong black vine, you just might see that sweet Jesus
