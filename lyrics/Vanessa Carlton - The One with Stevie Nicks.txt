Holiday and I come home
I hope to see this boy I know
I can't wait for us to be alone
Flippin' through the radio
We sing along to the indie show
The songs they play mean
More than I can say
And the tape I made you,
Hope you think of me when it plays through
I'm kind of sad now that it's done
And you think my time's for free
In all the ways you say to me
Sweet versions of let's wait and see

But You're always a golden boy and I'm the girl that you enjoy
My parents say isn't he a gifted son
Time is always passing by but still I have to wonder why
You can't come to tell me I'm the one
Summer goes and we have grown
We have our friends, live on our own
Still I'm not the girl you want me to be

Say gravity can bend the time, funny, I always liked your mind
But this whole thing is crushing me
But you're always a golden boy and this girl's heart that you destroy
You smile at me and then you have your fun
Time is always passing by so I give you another try
And hope that you will see that I'm the one

You say you're scared to get too close
Come let's see how it goes
I see you now at the show, the 7th in, the 7th row
Now you look at me and see what I've known for so long
Sad that you could be so lovely and so wrong

Came to say that I moved, I see your face you don't approve
Guess you could say that I'm already gone
But you'll always be my golden boy
and I'm the summer girl that you enjoy
Some melodies are best left undone
I feel the time pass away
But in my songs you will always stay
I don't need you to tell me I'm the one
I don't need you to tell me I'm the one
You'll never know that I was the one
