 Check it, check it, check it, uhh 

 I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me 

 And uhh, she got the hots for me the finest thing my eyes could see 

 But oh no, oh no, she gotta a man 

 and a son, doh'ohhh, but that's okay 

 Cause I, wait for my cue and just listen, play my position 

 Like a shortstop, pick up erything mommy hittin 

 And in no time.. (no time) I.. 

 I plan to make this one mi-i-ne.. and that's for sure 

 Cause I, I never been the type to, break up a happy home 

 But uh, there's somethin bout baby girl I just can't leave alone 

 So tell me ma what's it gonna be? She said 

 (You don't know what you mean to me)

 I know how niggaz start actin trippin out here about they girls 

 And there's no way-ayy, Nelly gon' fight over

 But I, I like your steez, your style, your whole demeez

 The way you come through and holla and swoop me in his 2-seater 

 Now that's gangstah-ahhh.. 

 And I got special ways to thank yah-ahhh.. don't you forget
