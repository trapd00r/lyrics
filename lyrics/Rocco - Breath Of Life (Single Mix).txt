I'll sing it
One last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing
That's right
In all I've done

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear

Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you
Can't raise your voice to say

To think
I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say
Our long goodbye
I nearly do

Light up

Slower slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is
To find an easier way
To get out
Of our little heads

Have heart my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if
It's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess
