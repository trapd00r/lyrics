J: If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you
And if you could only see yourself
You'd feel the same way too
You could say that I am a dreamer
Who's had a dream come true
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you

W:Ooh...
If you wonder why I'm smiling
It's because I'm happy with you
And the warm sensations, touch my heart
And fill me through and through
I could hold you close forever
And never let you go
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because I just love you so

J:Oh...
Now my heart is an open door
W: Won't you come inside for more?
B: You can love so sweetly now
Take my love, take me completly now,
W: Oh...
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you
And my eyes are just the window, oh
For my feelings to come through
J: And by far, you are more beautiful
Than anything, I ever know
If you say my eyes are beautiful
W: If you say my eyes are beautiful
J: If you say my eyes, my
B: eyes are beautiful, Oh...
J: It's because
W: It's because
B: They're looking at you

(What a beautiful song!!!!)
