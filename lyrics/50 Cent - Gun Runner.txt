Aw man, who the fuck is callin'?
I don't even wanna answer this shit, hello?

What up nigga it's Black, remember me from way back?
We used to go to school together man
I got your number from Heather, she said you sell guns
I got beef I wanna see what you got and if I like it I'll cop

Damn nigga, you hot, you talkin' like you tryin'
To get a nigga knocked what time is it? man, it's fuckin' 4 o'clock
I shouldn't sell you shit, but son, meet me on the block
I ain't got time to waste man, where this nigga at?

I'm in the Brown hooptie, there he go, I see 'em
Pullin' up slow in the BM
I popped my trunk to show him what I'm workin' wit'
First I showed him the Teck

I told him niggas give these shits respect
But you don't want this, man these shits is known to jam
This is a little smaller here
And a little more common, 9 Millimeter Ruger

16 shots, hollow points will go through ya
And this? this here? this is a 12 gauge Mossberg kid
Two shots and you can wet like half a block
This shit here gets my dick hard

It's a Calico, it holds a Hundred shots
If you can't kill your beef with this you need to stop
C'mon, pick somethin' now nigga, you know it's hot
Man, stop actin' like that nigga, just show me what you got

Aight, nigga look, I got Two 380's
One black, one chrome, and 4 glocks
They all hold 21 shots look, I done been through all my shit nigga
So tell me what you want
It's hard to choose man, I think I'll take 'em all

Oh, you gon' do me like that?
I got one more piece to show you, my Deringer
I keep it in the small of my back
It's a two shot, it's chrome, my initials engraved in it

Look at you now, you had to get it
Your BM? I'm takin' it, shit, you don't need it
Park it where I can watch it at and see if it got low jack
Then take it to the chop shop to my Man Kojak

He gon' give me more cream so I can cop mo' gats
Joe and Duke came through, them niggas copped two Tecks
Said, "Don't go by the gamblin' spot, that shit gon' get wet"
