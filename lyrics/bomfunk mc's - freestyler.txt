Freestyler... rock the microphone
Straight from the top of my dome
Freestyler... rock the microphone
Carry on with the freestyler

I gotz to hmm, to throw on
And go on, you know I gots to flow on
Select us on ya radio play us
Cause we're friendly for o-zone
But that's not all so hold on
Tight, as I rock the mic right
Oh... excuse me, pardon
As I synchronize with the analyzed
Upcoming vibes the session
Let there be a lesson, question
You carry protection
Or will your heart go on
Like Celine Dion, Karma Chameleon

(Chorus)
Yeah straight from the top of my dome
As I rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the microphone
Yeah straight from the top of my dome
As I rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the microphone

Style, steelos, we'll bring many kilos
So you could pick yours, from the various
Ambitious, nutritious, delicious, delirious
Or vicious, just tell us
We deliver anything from a cappella's to propellers
Suckers get jealous
But they're soft like marshmallows
You know they can't handle us
Like Debbie does Dallas
Yeah, we come scandalous so who the fuck
Is Alice, she from Buckingham Palace?

Freestyler... rock the microphone
Straight from the top of my dome
Freestyler... rock the microphone
Carry on with the freestyler

(Chorus)
Yeah straight from the top of my dome
As I rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the microphone
Yeah straight from the top of my dome
As I rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the microphone

Yeah straight from the top of my dome
As I rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the, rock the microphone
