I had dreams that were bigger than the Montana sky
And we were gonna do great in Great Falls
I just knew we were this time
But when winter finally broke, so were we
You'll never know how bad that hurt
'Cause this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world

I lost the farm in Kansas
Along with a lot of pride
Then I almost lost my life
Down in that West Virginia mine
And that motel room in Memphis
Was a long way from diamonds and pearls
And that sure ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world

I swear your love is stronger
Than any dream of mine I've ever drug you through
And I swear I wasn't lyin'
They just never did come true
You've always bet on this old gambler
Every time I gave the wheel a whirl
But this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world

Now this Shreveport sun is settin'
On another broken dream of mine
And I guess that mansion on the hill
Is pretty hard to see tonight
But as long as there's a breath of life in me
I'm gonna get it for you, girl
'Cause this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world

I swear your love is stronger
Than any dream of mine I've ever drug you through
And I swear I wasn't lyin'
They just never did come true
You've always bet on this old gambler
Every time I gave the wheel a whirl
But this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world

No, this sure ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
