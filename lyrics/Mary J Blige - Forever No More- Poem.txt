No More invisible, speechless, deaf and blind child
With neglected pleasures being addicted to denial
Floating through time gravitating towards a warm arm
With an appetite for the emptiness that promises, no harm

No more uncontrollable eruptions of emotional depression
A primal sos from the barren prison of selfless expression
That only the guilty with innocent souls know
Buried in the social scar tissue of a defective ego

No more relentless sifting through bodies seeking self
Settling through competitive combat for what抯 left on the shelf
A mad melee of supply and demand driven by a gullible pride
That leads to sedating the you that suffocates inside

No More, forever no more, because I抳e unshut my eyes
And the difference between God抯 word and man抯 will was realized
Seeing opposed and parallel lives some liguid and others frozen
Led me to never seek from man what God has chosen

Then the negative whispering subsided and the panicking ceased
The undercurrent suppression of pent up terror was released
As the mystery of the unknown manifested pristine clear
A positive message of truth entered my ear

Now across my face is a brand new smile
With the newly revealed meaning of a destined child
A message of hope is being released from my heart
And I am overwhelmed with dedication to do my part

All I ever wanted was to be what I once was, unbounded
Somehow it got all twisted and before long sounded
As though life was a continuous connive-thrive-drive
Choking out the simple joy of just being alive

Now I am filled with love; and I sing a love song
A song of yesterday, today tomorrow and beyond
My new prayer is, thank you God for setting me free
And thank you God for giving me back me
