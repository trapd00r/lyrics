(Verse)
Open the door, Close your eyes
Cause I'm about to give you all I've got, Tonight
There's a place, Deep inside of you
That I'm about to swim to

(Pre-Chorus)
I promise I promise babe (Promise you a night that you won't forget)
I'm sorry I'm sorry babe (For what's about to happen next, yeah)
I think your silhouette, looks better covered in sweat
I know you probably think I'm finished but I ain't even started yet

(Chorus)
I'm about to take off your clothes tonight
Put on a show tonight
We goin do it my way, We goin do all night We goin do it all day
We about to travel the globe tonight, girl just let go tonight
I'ma do it slow, when you think its over, I'ma give you more

(Verse)
Set the mood, turn out the lights
Cause I'm about to work your body babe, tonight
There's a place, below your waist, that I think I might wanna taste

(Pre-Chorus)
I promise I promise babe (Promise you a night that you won't forget)
I'm sorry I'm sorry babe (For what's about to happen next, yeah)
I think your silhouette, looks better covered in sweat
I know you probably think I'm finished but I ain't even started yet

(Chorus)
I'm about to take off your clothes tonight
Put on a show tonight
We goin do it my way, We goin do all night We goin do it all day
We about to travel the globe tonight, girl just let go tonight
I'ma do it slow, when you think its over, I'ma give you more
More, I'ma give you more
More of me, so give me more of you
More ..More.. More..

(Chorus)
I'm about to take off your clothes tonight
Put on a show tonight
We goin do it my way, We goin do all night We goin do it all day
We about to travel the globe tonight, girl just let go tonight
I'ma do it slow, when you think its over, I'ma give you more
