Keep yo hands in the air cuz we gon take it there/ And I know it

[Verse 1]If i'ma rob i'ma rob all night 
If i'm lookin for somthin it's probably a fight 
If i'm gonna fuck bitches then it betta be tight 
If thats dead, then the head betta be right 
If i gots ta play, i'ma play till i win 
Since i gotz to be here can't wait to begin 
Wanna fuck shorty, can't stand shortie friend 
Cuz honey friend fuck many many men 
Stay wit da rats cuz the rats is real 
Wanna fuck then we fuck, already know da deal 
Fuck what you look like just show da real

[Verse 2,Drag-On]
You fuckin wit me?Ain't keepin your health right 
Cuz me and my boys we keep our gel tight 
Shit I pack is heavy, but the shells light 
When they drop the same time you drop without a fight 
Burnin anything that i'm puttin my name on 
You might take a Drag but you can't flame on 
I know ya'll niggaz gon owe me wit a chain on 
When it come to the fire im the kid to blame it on 
When ya'll see like eight cars then you know who we are 
Niggaz spittin mean bars off of the Green Jar 
never drunk but you see me leant at the bar 
Spit fire that'll melt the ice on your arm 
You had dat but for now dog gimmie dat 
Cuz dog, you don't wanna see how my semi act 
Fake hustlin niggaz you pump many pac 
When it come to dis shit, i done layed plenty flat

Understand what you hear 
Don't let nobody tell you, what you hope and you fear(x2) 

[Verse3,DMX]

Ya'll niggaz front, then I hit you right dere 
Not really impressed by what niggaz wear 
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care 
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for da cause 
Fuck what you heard I will die for my dogs 
Ain't scared of shit, we'll ride in the fog 
Same thing, but a bigger size than ya'lls 
I fuck with Drag-On cuz he spits the flame 
Drag-On muthafucka don't forget da name 
And we are takin over, ain't shit da same 
If you ain't in our mob nigga,quit the game 
And ain't no other cats got love for me 
Ain't no other cat's thats gon bus slugs wit me 
Ain't no other cat's thats gonna shed blood for me 
But my dogs is gonna be a thug wit me
