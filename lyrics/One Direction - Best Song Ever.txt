Maybe it’s the way she walked (ow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (ow)
Just like she already owned it

I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went, "oh oh oh"
I think it went, "yeah yeah yeah"
I think it goes... (woooo)

Said her name was Georgia Rose (ow)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I had a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went, "oh oh oh"
I think it went, "yeah yeah yeah"
I think it goes... (woooo)

You know, I know, you know I’ll remember you
I know, you know, I know you’ll remember me
You know, I know, you know I’ll remember you
I know, you know, I hope you remember how we danced

(Oh oh oh)
(Yeah yeah yeah)
(How we danced)

One, two, one two three
Ow!

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
(We danced, we danced)
(And it goes something like this)
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can’t remember
(How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her)
How it goes but I know that I won’t forget her
(Best song ever)
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went, "oh oh oh"
I think it went, "yeah yeah yeah"
I think its goes... (woooo)

Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
