I moved out to Langley recently
With a plain and simple dream
Wanna infiltrate some third world place
And topple their regime
Those men in black with their matching suitcases
Where everything's on a need-to-know basis
Agents got that swagger
Everyone's so "cloak and dagger"

I'm feelin' nervous but I'm really kinda wishin'
For an undercover mission
That's when the red alert came on the radio
And I put my earpiece on
Got my dark sunglasses on
And I had my weapon drawn

So I get my handcuffs, my cyanide pills
My classified dossier
Tappin' the phones like yeah
Shreddin' the files like yeah
I memorized all the enemy spies
I gotta neutralize today
Yeah... It's a party in the CIA
Yeah... It's a party in the CIA

I've done a couple of crazy things
That've almost gotten me dismissed
Like terminate some head of state
Who wasn't even on my list
Burn that microfilm, buddy, will you?
I'd tell you why, but then I'd have to kill you
You need a quickie confession?
We'll start a waterboarding session
No hurry on this South American dictator
I'll assassinate him later
That's when he walked right in my laser sights
And my silencer was on
And my silencer was on
And another target's gone

Yeah, we got our black ops all over the world
From Kazakhstan to Bombay
Payin' the bribes like yeah
Pluggin' the leaks like yeah
Interrogating the scum of the earth
We'll break 'em by the break of day
Yeah... It's a party in the CIA
Yeah... It's a party in the CIA

Need a country destabilized?
Look no further, we're your guys
We've got snazzy suits and ties
And a better dental plan than the FBI's

Better put your hands up and get in the van
Or else you'll get blown away
Stagin' a coup like yeah
Brainwashin' moles like yeah
We only torture the folks we don't like
You're probably gonna be okay
Yeah... It's a party in the CIA
Yeah... It's a party in the CIA
