I wanna see you move,
Do you like it? Huh?
Uh, yeh, yeh, uh.

My loneliness is killing me,
And I, I must confess,
I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind,
Give me a sign,
Hit me baby one more time.

Oh baby, baby, baby (crazy)

You drive me crazy,
I just cant sleep,
I'm so excited,
I'm in too deep.
Woah, Crazy,
But it feels alright,
Baby thinkin of you keeps me up all night.

Get it, get it, get it, get it

I'm a slave for you,
I can not hold it,
I can not control it,
I'm a slave for you,
I wont deny it,
I'm not tryna hide it baby.

(Baby) baby (baby, hit me) baby
(Baby) baby (hit me baby)

oops, oops (x4)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(x2)

Oops I did it again,
I played with your heart,
Got lost in this game,
Oh baby baby,
Oops you think I'm in love,
That I'm sent from above,
I'm not that innocent.

But now im stronger,
Than yesterday (Sing it!)
Now its nothin but my way,
My loneliness aint killin me no more,
I, I'm stronger.

Stop!

Yeh, like that.

Everytime I try to fly I fall,
Without my wings I feel so small,
I guess I need you baby,
Everytime I see you in my dreams,
I see your face, its haunting me,
I guess I need you baby

I wanna see you move.

With the taste of you lips,
I'm on a ride,
You're toxic I'm slippin under,
With The taste of a poison paradise,
I'm addicted to you,
Dont you know that your toxic?
N I love what ya do,
Dont you know that your toxic?

(Risadas)
