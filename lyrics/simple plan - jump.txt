Jump
I don't want to wake up today 
'Cause everyday's the same 
And I've been waiting so long 
For things to change 
I'm sick of this town 
Sick of my job 
Sick of my friends 
'Cause everyone's jaded 
Sick of this place 
I want to break free 
I'm so frustrated 

I just want to jump (jump!) 
Don't want to think about tomorrow (jump!) 
I just don't care tonight 
I just want to jump (jump!) 
Don't want to think about my sorrow 
Lets go, whoa 
Forget your problems 
I just want to jump 

I don't want to wake up one day 
And find out it's too late 
To do all the things I want to do 
So I'm gonna pack up my bags 
I'm never coming back 
'Cause the years are passing by 
And I've wasted all my t-t-time 

I'm sick of this house 
Sick of being broke 
Sick of this town that's bringing me down 
I'm sick of this place 
I want to break free 
I'm so frustrated 

I just want to jump (jump!) 
Don't want to think about tomorrow (jump!) 
I just don't care tonight 
I just want to jump (jump!) 
Don't want to think my sorrow 
Let's go, whoa 
Forget your problems; I just want to jump 
I just want to jump 

I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore 

Forget tomorrow 
I just want to jump (jump!) 
Don't want to think about tomorrow (jump!) 
I just don't care tonight 
I just want to jump (jump!) 
Don't want to think my sorrow 
Lets go, whoa 
Forget your problems 
Time to let them go 
Whoa 
Forget tomorrow 
I just want to jump (jump!) 
I just want to jump (jump!) 
Yeah! 
I just want to jump (jump!) 
I just want to jump
