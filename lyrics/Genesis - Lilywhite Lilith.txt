The chamber was in confusion 
All the voices shouting loud
I could only just hear
A voice quite near say 
"Please help me through the crowd"

Said if I helped her through
She could help me too
But I could see that she was wholly blind
But from her pale face 
And her pale skin
A moonlight shined

Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

When I'd led her through the people
The angry noise began to grow
She said "Let me feel 
The way the breezes blow
And I'll show you where to go"

So I followed her into a big round cave
She said "They're coming for you
Now don't be afraid"
Then she sat me down 
On a cold stone throne
Carved in jade

Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna take you through the tunnel of night
Lilywhite Lilith
She gonna lead you right

She leaves me in my darkness
I have to face
Face my fear
And the darkness 
Closes in on me
I can hear a whirring sound 
Growing near

I can see the corner of the tunnel
Lit up 
By whatever's coming here
Two golden globes 
Float into the room
And a blaze of white light 
Fills the air
