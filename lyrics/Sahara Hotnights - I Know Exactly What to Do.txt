There are a hundred pointers we don't
Ever want to care about
It's time for a policy they don't want to know nothing about
Common sense and reality
Words we don't like never did like
I have a (cloud beckons) over me and the wrong and the right

Oh so far away from home
I know exactly what to do

Watch him go down and down
And when we are first in line
And when we are satisfied
It's just a goodbye

And we are struggling to make sense
Somehow we shocked the underworld
Looking for a house yeah
Looking for a place where no one can hurt us
Looking like strangers
And we are making ourselves heard

Oh so far away from home
I know exactly what to do

Oh so far away from home
I know exactly what
I know exactly what to do
