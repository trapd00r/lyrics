emineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem

Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

Man first of all I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows
Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him
'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party

Pull a 5th of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I've been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like im hollerin' die Santa
Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and 2 innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' to play the Wall like you're Paul and
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's
But im not throwin' ones, five, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at Skinny's
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west but when it comes to them trailers in them Southparks
Muffle it 'cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies, if your belly button's not an innie then im outtie
Now hop in my mini-van, let's get rowdy, come on

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party

Now whether your black, white or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know your up to evil and your no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep yo hood

Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot 'cause, girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window out of my Gremlin, put 2 milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick, it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y and I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now, im so raw, I still need to un-thaw
You feel me y'all, I'll shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But, baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now git up

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party
