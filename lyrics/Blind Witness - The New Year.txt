This is a new beginning for me
A way to reset my brain
A way to erase this whole year
That brought me nothing
Nothing but pain

Time for a new resolution
Start up with new temptations
I know this will always be a a part of me
I can't get over and it's killing me
But I need to move on
Then that night came on
The train that I needed to jump on
