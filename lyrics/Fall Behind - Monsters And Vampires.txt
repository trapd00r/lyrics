Unsolid

I can jump on the last train
I can sit in the House of God
I can go down the big drain
I can head for the Milky Way
You're just another bum ride
You're just another Viet Nam
You're just another creature
In the way of the master plan
Why don't you tell me something I don't alerady know?
I gotta go to the big tree
I gotta tell me where to go

I'm Five Years Ahead of My Time
I'm leaving somewhere in a new dimension
I'm leaving and the world's so far behind
I'm doing exactly what I want to
Society can't play with my mind
Don't waste any time, girl
Step inside my mind
I'm five years ahead of my time
Look into my mind
Look ahead, don't look behind
I'm five years ahead of my time
Well it may seem like I'm coming on strong
But I know just where it's at for me
I do care about me right or wrong
?On all of the golden life's mystery?
If you love me, baby
Come along with me
I'm five years ahead of my time
Look into my mind
Look ahead, don't look behind
I'm five years ahead of my time
It may seem like I'm coming on strong
But I know just where it's at for me
I do care about me right or wrong
?On all of the golden life's mystery?
Step inside my mind
Look ahead, don't look behind
I'm five years ahead of my time
Look into my mind, girl
Look ahead, don't look behind
I'm five years ahead of my time
