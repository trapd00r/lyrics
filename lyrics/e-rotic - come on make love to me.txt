Sorry, baby, I didn't tell you
It's just love, I'm longing for
When your body's next to mine, babe,
I need it more and more and more
Yeah, tonight you're my star
And tonight will never part
Cause love is an art
Let's capture at your heart
Come on, move along
What we're doing is not wrong
I never say forever
But together we are strong
Come on, Max, make love to me
Cause you got the special key
And I will never let you go
Come on, make love to me
You are my fantasy
And let me feel, you love me so
I'm just lost in dreams of passion
Your devotion I adore
When your soul's in my possession
I need it more and more and more
So come on, it's alright
We are going for the light
It's love, take a fight
Why don't you hold me tight
It's you and it's me
It's with you I wanna be
You've got a pretty keyhole
Oh, baby, but I've got the key
[chorus]
Come on, make love to me
Come on, make love to me
Come on, make love to me
Come on, come on
Make love to me
Come on, make love to me
Come on, make love to me
Come on, make love to me, come on
