Winter's been real long this year
I know, cause I've been there
Summer never seemed to come along
And when it did, it felt all wrong
You've been sitting on the sidewalks wondering what went wrong with your life
You've been walking to your bedside table and in the top drawer was a knife

Time to take your sweetheart by the hand and lead him to the Promised Land
The only place in North America not destroyed by the government
San Francisco! You're going
San Francisco! We're going
Don't you know you'll never ever want to turn back

I have news for you my friend:
I'm sticking by you until the end
Doctor's ordering you the same prescription, see, that worked wonders for me
I sat by myself in bars, I was driven home in state-owned cars
I was filled with so much hate until I saw the Golden Gate
Until my sweetheart took me by the hand and led me to the Promised Land
The only place in North America not yet destroyed by the government

San Francisco! You're going
San Francisco! We're going
Don't you know you'll never ever want to turn back

And it's time to pack your bags and call in sick and bring the toothbrush
Withdraw from that savings account what's savings for, time doesn't wait and
Hold the door, I'm coming, all that jazz
Like an escape from Alcatraz
