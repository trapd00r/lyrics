Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

Come on, don't feel this way
You're going to solve this for one day
You wanna get high and then complain?
Girl, I only think of you always and forever, and forever

Remember when you just came out
When everyone knew what you were all about
You faked your death and that was fun
But girl, I think it's just begun

You take another line
And you feel fine, this time
And it goes like this

Girl, alright, tell me what to do, girl
I'm so in love, whoa
I'm so in love with you, you, you

I'll just stop
Right around when things get bad
You said that and much has passed
Come on now, this'll be real fast
Darling, I know you need the cash
Yeah, move like that
Yeah, yeah, yeah, move like that

"The sky will clear," you say with ease
You leave real fast to get relieved
Your heart was locked
I had the key
Now this disease won't let us be

You take another line
And you feel fine, this time
And it goes like this

Girl, alright, tell me what to do, girl
I'm so in love, whoa
I'm so in love with you, you, you

Come on, girl, I need you (Just to try to break through)
Everything about you (Makes me wanna leave you)
Come on, girl, I need you (Just to try to break through)
Everything about you (Makes me wanna leave you)

Girl, alright, tell me what to do, girl
I'm so in love, whoa
I'm so in love with you, you, you

Girl, alright, tell me what to do, girl
I'm so in love, whoa
I'm so in love with you, you, you

Everything about you makes me want to leave you
