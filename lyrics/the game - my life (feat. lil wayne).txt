Punk ass motherfucka!
Bitch ass nigga!
What were you gonna do? 
Kill me in my sleep you bitch ass nigga?
Tupac, Biggie shut the fuck up!
Fucking dogs, they barking shit...
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!
Fuck you nigga!

Lil Wayne
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
Cause they say you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find,
A way through the day
A life for the night
Dear lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?

The Game
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary.
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley.
Take me away...
Like I overdosed on cocaine,
Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain.
Suicide, I'm from a windy city
Like Do or Die.
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified.
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fucking reason.
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces. (My life!)
Cause that's Jesus people, and Game he's the equal.
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel.
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Sigel.
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle. (My life!)
I need some meditation, so I can lead my people.
They askin' why?
Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question, 'fore this bullet leave this desert eagle.

The Game
We are not the same, I am a Martian.
So approach my Phantom doors with caution.
You see them 24's spinnin'
I earned 'em.
I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson 'cause it ain't about race now.
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down.
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile.
Damn I know his mama proud,
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now.
And like MJB, no more drama now.
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground.
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it outta town.
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds.
My life used to be empty, like a glock without a round.
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds.

The Game
Walked through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front,
With the high beams on.
Me and the devil sharing chronic blunts.
Listening to The Chronic album, playin' backwards.
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice.
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood.
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could.
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood.
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood.
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood.
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should.
With the top back, and my Sox hat.
I'm Paid in Full, the nigga Alvo couldn't stop that.
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back,
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back.

Lil Wayne

Looking to find,
A way through the day
A life for the night
Dear, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?

My Life (my life, my life, my life)
My Life (my life, my life, my life)
My Life (my life, my life, my life)
My Life (my life, my life, my life)
