I'm the ace analyzing ASCII algorithms
All architectures allow me to get with them
Antivirus agents aren't able to anesthetize
The acidic apps that I cause to arise

You better backup your bytes
And beef up your buffers
Before bugs in your browser
Breach your barriers like butter

Corrupting the CMOS, causing cores to corrode
Cracking crypto in CCB mode
Clearing out the cache, calling CPU commands

Downloading data, dissing DRM demands
Dancing in the dark with digital demons
Directing DoS while defenders are dreaming

Every e-mail's examined with ease
Even experts can't escape my exe's
As each effortlessly expands my empire

Filling up files faster than firewire
Foolish fat fucks frequently flame me
Forensic flatfoots fail to frame me

Groupies Google me to get gigs of GIFs
Giving graphic guarantees that I shoot the gift
Going for the gold, I'm the gigahertz gangsta

I hurt hard drives by hooking hardware handlers
How many homepages have I hacked?
When your HP hangs, don't have a heart attack

Intel's infrastructure is inherently inferior
To the intellect that illumines the interior
Of the inner-sanctum where I like to interface

Jotting down Java that jostles jackanapes
Journaling just might save your Jaz drive
When I jack the joules keeping your junk alive

Killer apps keep knocking like Kris Kringle
Kleptomaniacs biting like Kraft singles
All the kids know that I kick it with Kernighan

Let me lay claim to the lessons you should learn again
Lambda calculus lashes losers who ain't proud
I'm not the Lord of Linux? I'm laughing out loud

I melt malicious machines like margarine
Meaningless morons get moved to the margins
Music murders monopolies like Microsoft

Nothing's what I need to get nasty as Nabokov
Never negotiate with narrow-band newbs
Making numerous networks of NANDs with nanotubes

Obfuscating object code's an obligation
To orchestrate my opponents' obliteration
Overall, it's obvious that open source gets owned

By proprietary programs my processor is prone
To produce and precipitate your packet getting perforated
No patch prevents piracy I've perpetrated

My QWERTY queues up queries in quantity
Quit quoting quatrains of questionable quality
Quadtrees quell your quandaries quadratically

Real time research revises rules radically
RSA and Rijndael won't repel my raids
And your router won't refuse the packets I've replayed

My SSID has no static on its signal
My static IP's safeguarded by a sentinel
Screw with my server, I'll serve you a smack up

I tend tons of terabytes on my tape backup
With TCP technology I threaten terror
Tricking terminals through Type-2 error

I upload UNIX passwords using utilities
Like USB, I have ubiquitous abilities
Unprotected unzipping in UDMA

Van Eck phreaking videos via VGA
My voice is a vehicle for virtual venom
I view vulnerabilities and then vie with them

With WiFi my WAN wickedly wires words
The World Wide Web gets wrecked with worms
When will you know my work's not WYSIWYG

It's extreme like X-rays when I plot like xfig.
x86 is where Xinu gets rocked
Execution is for those who Xerox

You're yodeling from yonder and away
Yet you've made no Yen since Y2K
You yearn for success like that of Yahoo

But your zombie processes could fill up a zoo
Your zero knowledge proofs are flawed like Zionism
I'm in the zone like Zeus, hot like Zebra jism.
