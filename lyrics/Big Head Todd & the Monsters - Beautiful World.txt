Seems you let a lot pass you by
When you let ambition decide
Everything has went up and gone
And all your money left you alone

Chorus:
We made a planet, a beautiful world
Let love surround it, and give it a whirl
I can't understand why it's so hard to keep
This beautiful world living and free ...

Time to let the watch unwind
Tell your heart to make up your mind
We can't wait to give at the end
Wasting all the time we can't spend

Chorus

Running after things you don't need
Is bound to trip you up with your greed
Stop your hand from lifting its load
Tell that traveler 'come on home'

Chorus
