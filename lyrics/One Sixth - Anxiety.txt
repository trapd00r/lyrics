Everybody says "peace" but on the low they want to start war
Last week I mailed all my enemies
A naked picture of me to put on they dartboard
My heart pours its feelings towards
Even the most annoying organisms
Everything from the floor to the ceiling
I'm peeling off the skin and digging in
To see the depth
Taking what I need to succeed
And not looking back to see what's left
I keep it fresh
My lyrics are the opposite of meaningless
When the mic's in my hand
I get lost in the land of Eyedea-ness
I breathe the mist of mind pollution
For cleanliness I'll be searching forever
We should be working together
We all experience pain
Just in different versions and measures
We get hurt from the weather
Whether it's too much cold or too much rain
On the wrong side of the brain
Look how strong I have became
Through the songs that I've arranged
Grab your bong and light the flame
Fly to a different time frame
While I aim with precision
At the sky with my distance
And you'll witness the difference
Between being persistent
Finally saying you did it and saying you tried
Right on, now pound it, bye
I don't know why you abide by the lies
The tide is coming
And I'm wondering if you wanted to borrow my life jacket
But I bet you don't you've got too much pride, right?

I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
Just let me know when you want to get a taste of real life
(Every yellow entity inside me
Even on the eyeballs
The ego attached)

I'll be walking forward while the world rotates in circles
Keepin' my thoughts concrete
While you try to pave my dirt road
My noggin will be noddin'
While I'm dodging all that's growing towards me
While you're in your basement scared and shaking
Anticipating World War Three
You'll remember my name and I'll never know yours
I'll shine while your time is tickin'
And you're sittin' lickin' your cold sores
Behind closed doors, I use ink to build a castle
Me and you are finally cool but I think you're still an asshole
You'll miss the essence of life being soulful gets no money
While I got the tv on mute
Watching the hoes in your video gettin' horny
You can watch me grow while I watch you shrink
Keep my head above water while you drown
And sink in the bottom of your drink
I'll be in a b-boy stance while they yell, "strike a pose"
And after you write your flows
I'll use your paper to wipe my nose
I'll been shaving three times a day
To make my mustache grow
While you're guzzling Robitussin
Struggling to remember if you ever voted
I'll dry my eyes so I can see better in the long run
While your vision is blurry
Cause most the time your head is in a condom
I keep my feet planted while you get so high
But who cares? Cause someone will be having fun
While we both die

I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
Just let me know when you want to get a taste of real life
(Every yellow entity inside me
Even on the eyeballs
The ego attached)

Everyone says "piece" and on the low they want the whole pie
But they're losing the race talking til they're blue in the face
So I review their mistakes and go by the rules that I make
With closed eyes in alphabetical order
I slaughter the fools that are fake
As soon as I prove the escape with madness
I'ma cruise to the lake and go swimming
Cause people ain't nothin'
But a bunch of walkin' pointless opinions
I'm feeding the big mouths of the world a rusty nail sandwich
And if anyone in Minnesota don't like me
(Shit) I hope your car gets hail damage
Give or take the few things I've learned there and here
This year I basically learned how to sit patiently
And talk about my dick
One take I'm living great
Every night I write rhymes but in my spare time
What I do is I sneak in the Garden of Eden
And try to pick some grapes
Share my shake [?] lick my plate, stay up late and drift away
I fell down yesterday so ain't no need to trip today
I have to say I act this way cause society has given anxiety
In a variety of beverages with a nasty aftertaste
I never just let a kid lie to me saying he's fresh with it
I masturbate with my rivalry and don't try to be negative
So fascinate yourself with thinking of me
Don't be another example of a brain-cell holocaust lost in TV

I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
I'ma be me you can be whatever feels right
Just let me know when you ever want to get a taste of real life
