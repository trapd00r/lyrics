Too black, too strong
Too black, too strong

Yo, Chuck, these alley trippers are still frontin' on us
Show 'em that we can do this
Cause we always knew this, haha
Yeah, boy

Bass, how low can you go
Death row, what a brother know
Once again, back is the incredible rhyme animal
The uncannable D, public enemy number one
Five-O said “freeze” and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I never really had a gun
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records, they sell
Cause a brother like me said, well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you
What you ought to do is follow for now
Power of the people, say
Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out (yeah, y'all, come on)
Here we go again

(Turn it up)
Bring the noise
(Turn it up)

Hey yo, Chuck, they say we too black, man (bring the noise)
Yo, I don’t understand what they’re sayin'
But little do they know, they can get a smack for that, man

Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music
That the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters
Now across the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait, till we get it right
Radio stations, I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

(Turn it up)
Bring the noise
(Turn it up)

Hey yo, Chuck, they’re illin', we chillin' (bring the noise)
Yo, P.E. in the house, top billin'
Yo, Chuck, show 'em what you can do, boy

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, y'know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide much should be safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, y'know
You call 'em demos (but we ride limos, too)
Whatcha gonna do, rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono (beat is for Yoko Ono)
Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell (wax is for Anthrax)
Still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X it

(Turn it up)
Bring the noise
(Turn it up)

Yo, they should know by now that they can’t stop this bum rush (bring the noise)
Word up, better keep tellin' me to turn it down
But yo, Flavor Flav ain't going out like that

Come on
Come on
Come on now
Come on

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
Stand, my man, the beat's the same with a boast toast
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last, why you ask
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth, you can investigate
No need to wait, get the record straight (hey)
Posse in effect, got Flavor, Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
You got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you

Ay yo, Griff, get the S1W
We got to handle this
We ain’t goin' out like that
Yo man, straight up on the Columbo tip
We can do this like Brutus
Cause we always knew this, you know what I'm sayin'
There's just one thing that puzzles me, my brother
What's wrong with all these people around here, man
Is there clockin'
Is there rockin'
Is there jockin'
