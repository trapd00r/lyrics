Frail, sexy and I never knew just what it meant
Things all over but never sent,
I could pin a medal on you
I could pin a medal on you oh

This memory set
I guess the sound the city gets
Miss you much or would you beg
I could pin a medal on you
I could pin a medal on you oh

Everybody's under your spell
Everybody's under your spell
I don't think you would tell
But everybody' under your spell

Oh my you give away
Come and visit or come to stay
The way you spoke and the words you say
I could pin a medal on you
I could pin a medal on you oh

Frail, sexy and I never knew just what it meant
Things are over and I wish I've sensed
I could pin a medal on you
I could pin a medal on you oh

Everybody's under your spell
I don't think you would tell
But everybody' under your spell
Everybody's under your spell
Everybody's under your spell

Everybody's under your spell
Everybody's under your spell
I don't think you would tell
But everybody's under your spell
