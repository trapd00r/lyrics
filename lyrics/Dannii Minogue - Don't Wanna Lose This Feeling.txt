I'm back for more and I got the cure
I know where I'm going for sure
What we threw away, we should be saved
Come and make my day

(Break)
I said some things
That did not ring true
And I said some things I did not mean to
Now I'm back for more (more)

'Cause I don't wanna lose this feeling
That you're giving me every time I need it
Ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me more, and more
I don't wanna lose this feelin'
That you're givin' me every time I need it
I ain't lookin' for more
I need what you're givin' me, more
(Give me more)

Why can't we blow, why don't we go
With our imperfections, we know
What we threw away, should be saved
Come and make my day

(Repeat BREAK)

Don't wanna lose, don't, this feel
Don't, don't wanna lose, don't, this feel
Wanna lose, don't, this, this feel
I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready, ready

I'm ready, come get me
And give me some more, give me some more
I'm ready, come get me
And give me some more

Ooh I'm ready
Oh give me some more
Oh some more
Yeah
