War has been fought
Made a mistake
Sign of defeat
All over your face
Give it a try
This may be the last chance
We'll ever have
Finding the highlands

I swear I'll take you there
If you let me
You'll never forget me
I swear I'll amaze you
If you let me
Maybe that could save us
Maybe that could save us

War has gone out
There's no one to save
Sign of relief
All over your face
As bad as it gets
Harder we try
The deeper we fell
And up until now i never knew
Way to the highlands

I swear I'll take you there
If you let me
You'll never forget me
I swear I'll amaze you
If you let me
Maybe that could save us
That could save us

I swear
