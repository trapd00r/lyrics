Good morning
Wake up

Wake up with purpose and polite efficiency
Stuff vitamin pills down your health guarantee
A kiss and cuddle with a lucky girl
You get fed and watered 
Makes your hair curl

And when the day draws in
You put on a record
Put on something gentle
And wait for the cows to come home

Wake up a little voice says 
To you eagerly
You mustn't let yourself sink financially
Don't listen to the accusation that you're tight
You could be the first man on your street to get it right

And when the day draws in
You going to go into waltz time
For once it was a good time
Wait for the cows to come home
All your life

Ha da de da da 
Ha da de da da 
Ha da da de da
Ha da de da da da 

Wake up with purpose and polite efficiency
So you get fed and watered with good company
And when the day draws in
You go into waltz time
For once it's a good time
Wait for the cows to come home
All your life
