You can feel your nerve endings
They've been dead before today
You can feel them rising
Feel them rising all the way

You've got grease on your fingers
oil on your face
Happy completely chasing the pace
Happy to find out even this late
You're not a number

There's a new sense of freedom
Come banging on your door
Deep down inside you
You've seem it all somewhere before
Somewhere in the past
Somewhere in a dream
It's got you completely
And you know what it means
Happy to find out even this late
You're not a number

There's a new sense of freedom
Come banging on your door
Deep down inside you
You've seem it all somewhere before
You've got grease on your fingers
oil on your face
Happy completely chasing the pace
Happy to find out even this late
You're not a number
