In slow-motion I'm reborn
I need a week to mow the lawn
I eat dinner with my flip-flops on
Now that the summer's here

With my chores I only flirt
Hung in my hammock reading Kurt
Struggling to remain inert
Now that the summer's here

Now that the summer is here
I laze all day, my work can wait
At night behave like a firefly
And oscillate with my mate

Now that the summer is here
I laze all day, my work can wait
At night behave like a firefly
And oscillate with my mate

I can spare some wherewithal
Listening to Ahmad Jamal
"Poinciana" says it all
Now that the summer's here

One thing is crystal clear:
I won't be going anywhere
Except my Adirondack chair
Now that the summer's here
...
