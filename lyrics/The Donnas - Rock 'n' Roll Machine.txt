Rock 'n' roll machine
I'm an American teenage raider
You better be in by 11 o' clock
But I never come in till later

Whatcha gonna do?
Where yah gonna go?
I ain't into goin' steady
Don't do this, don't do that
I'll grow up when I'm ready
And I don't wanna be just a weekend kid,
I wanna party whenever I can

'Cause I don't care about goin' to school
And I don't care about having friends
And I don't care 'cause I'm a rock 'n' roll machine

It's a Saturday night
And I'm lookin' for some party action
I don't care about gettin' laid
I want some quick and easy satisfaction

What you gonna do?
Where you going to go?
I ain't into goin' steady
Don't do this, don't do that
I'll grow up when I'm ready
And I don't wanna be just a weekend kid,
I wanna party whenever I can

'Cause I don't care about goin' to school
And I don't care about havin' no friends
And I don't care 'cause I'm a rock 'n' roll machine

Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll!
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll!
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll!
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll!
