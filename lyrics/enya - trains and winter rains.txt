City streets (passing by)
Underneath (stormy skies)

Neon signs (in the night)
Red and blue (city lights)
Cargo trains rolling by
Once again (someone cries)

Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)

Every time (it's the same)
One more night (one more train)
Everywhere (empty roads)
Where they go no-one knows

Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)

Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
