You said there's something about the moon
It rose too soon
And we're doing what we should
You said it's life that moves too much
We're losing touch
But I'm not losing you

There's a whole lot of heart in me
I feel it under my skin
And I know and I know and I know
There's a whole lot of heart in me
It takes a whole lot of heart to see
Everything's coming down roses
And I know and I know and I know
There's a whole lot of heart in me

There's a whole lot of heart in me

I said we've walked this way before
Now we know more
So raise a cup
I said "Let's rule this kingdom now
Let's live and love and tear it down
To build it up"

There's a whole lot of heart in me
I feel it under my skin
And I know and I know and I know
There's a whole lot of heart in me
It takes a whole lot of heart to see
Everything's coming down roses
And I know and I know and I know
There's a whole lot of heart in me

Let it go
To let it in
Let it in
Let it in
Let it go

Let it go
To let it in
To let it in
Let it in
Let it go

You let it go
To let it in

And I know and I know and I know
There's a whole lot of heart in me
There's a whole lot of heart in me
I feel it under my skin
And I know and I know and I know
There's a whole lot of heart in me
It takes a whole lot of heart to see
Everything's coming down roses
And I know and I know and I know
There's a whole lot of heart in me
There's a whole lot of heart in me
And I know and I know and I know
And I know and I know and I know
And I know and I know and I know
And I know and I know and I know
And I know and I know and I know
And I know and I know and I know
