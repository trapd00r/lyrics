Well I told you everything that I could tell
But I guess I got a couple words
That I have to take with me to hell

Well what do you expect a man like me to do ooh

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you

Well some things are made for breaking
Soon enough they broke
Settling down into the dust
Going up in smoke

Well what do you expect a man like me to do ooh

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you

Got to hold on something
If I can't hold on to you
