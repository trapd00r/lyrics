I hear the children play
with the guards of the jail
with the guards of the jail
with the guards of the jail

I'm thinking of a new name
that I could give myself
one day I'll be myself
oh, I'll be my own

It's been forty long years
in the desert I have been
I've even hit the devils nose
in the desert I have grown

And as a woman said
that day when I was crying out
God puts his diamonds in the sand
but then he will always takes them back

Have a good day brother
me and your sister will rise up
like an elephant
from the mud
in your carefree sleep
we will brake free
we will brake free

Have a good day brother
me and your little bro
me and your sister will rise up
like an elephant
from the storm
in your carefree sleep
we will brake free

And the city will be reborn
and the streets will be washed
may the streets be clean and washed
may the streets be clean and washed

And we will wave our hand
and everybody will forget the past
and everybody will forget the past

And as a woman said
that day when I was crying out
God puts his diamonds in the sand
but then he will always takes them back

Have a good day brother
me and your sister will rise up
like an elephant
from the mud
in your carefree sleep
we will brake free
we will brake free

Have a good day brother
me and your little bro
me and your sister will rise up
like an elephant
from the storm
in your carefree sleep
we will brake free
we will brake free

I'm thinking of a new name
that I could give myself
one day I'll be myself
oh, I'll be my own
