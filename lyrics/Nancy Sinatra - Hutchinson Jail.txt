Lyrics

Cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

Somebody help me please 
I'm as helpless as I can be
And I don't know what my life is comin' to
Now they say that I shot a man 
Well I never shot I ran
And that was my first mistake I'm telling you

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

I got a man in Wichita and a man in Saginaw
And they both ain't heard from me in some time
I hate to disappoint them both but some feller under oath
Said I did it and they believed his story not mine

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

There's snow all over the ground 
And there ain't one robin around, that I'd trust to carry a message to a friend
I guess I'll just stay here till spring 
I sure wish I knew what spring
They'd let me out so I can start again

Ah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail, yeah it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail

Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, it's cold in the Hutchinson Jail
