"Do a dance for me"
Baby, it is late still you pour me
A tall one, “Go on
Let the liquid take off what you’re on
You’ve been down before"
Boy, not like this
I’m in quicksand
I am sinking fast
“Perfect,” he laughed
“'Cause your other half
Has got himself a Devil’s access

"Welcome to England,” he said, “Welcome to my world
You better bring your own sun, sweet girl
You got to bring your own sun, now don’t you forget
you bring your own sun, just enough for everyone”

Heels on, go on
Bang a Tango but do not get tangled
Who can stay strong
When they only give us lies to lean on?
When your heart explodes
Is it deathly cold?
You must let the colours violate the
Blackness, there is
A magic world parallel
So leave your daily hell

“Welcome to England,” he said, “Welcome to my world”

It’s not a question if I can
Fight by your side and withstand
Anything but, I forgot
Yhat you said, “Girl, if you come

You better bring your sun, sweet girl
You gotta bring your sun, now don’t you forget
You bring your sun, just enough for everyone
For everyone

“Welcome to England”
Welcome to England
