(Feat. rihanna)

[Razah:] girl I need to know now
[Rihanna:] boy I need to know now
[Razah:] said I need to know now
[Rihanna:] said I need to know now
Ooh baby yeah
I really need to know

Where do we go from here
I thought I made it clear
Where do we go from here
I thought I made it clear

(Verse 1: razah)
So confused girl I'm lost without u
I can't go to sleep 'cause I toss without ya
Damn baby I can't live without u
Callin ma hoez & I jus talk about ya
When we use to be getting it right
The things we use to do when we
Would read and write
Damn baby jus to feel ya thighs
And to look into ya eyez

Where do we go from here
I thought I made it clear
Where do we go from here
I thought I made it clear

(Verse 2: rihanna)
Can we go back where we started again
If we can't be lover can we atleast be friends
I'll be there to the very end
Told you that from back when
When we started out
Two little youngsters with our puppylove
We're a gift from above
Now it's all gone & I need to know

Where do we go from here (where do we go from here)
I thought I made it clear (I thought I made it clear)
Where do we go from here (tell 'em baby)
I thought I made it clear

Togeather:
I-i-i love-e-e
