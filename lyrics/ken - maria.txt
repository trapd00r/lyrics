There was no one nothing to see
The night is useless and so are we
Cause everybody knows
The fabric of folly is fallen apart at the seams
And I've been lookin' for a good time
But the pleasures are seldom and few
There's no whiskey there's no wine
Just the concrete and a worried mind
Cause everyone knows death creeps in slow
Til you feel safe in his arms
And I've been lookin' for a new friend
And I don't care if he's decrepit and grey
O maria haven't you known
Days so careless
All on your own
Everybody knows the circus is closed
And the animals have gone wild
And I've been lookin' for my shadow
But this place is so bright and so clean
There was no one nothing to see
The night is useless and so are we
Cause everybody knows
The fabric of folly is fallen apart at the seams
And I've been lookin' for a good time
But the pleasures are seldom and few
