I'm just a girl with a crush on you

I don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
To the thought of you honey
So tell me if you want me still
If only I could trade the fancy cars, for a chance today
Its incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars, everybody say
That I have it all

Chorus:
But I can't make you love me
Is it my life or the things I do?
I can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

I have been through changes
Yeah
But I'm still the girl you used to know
It's made me no different
So tell me why you have to go
Oh baby I would trade the fancy cars, for a chance today
Its incomparable
I might be sitting with the movie stars, everybody say
That I just have it all

Chorus

Just the thought of being close to you
Its incomparable
I should be happy with the life I live
And the things I do, seems like I have it all

Can't make you, make you love me baby
It's my life, what can I do?
Can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you

Chorus
