I'm coming down with a heartache tonight
Only you can make it all right
If I can be with you holding me tight
There won't be no more in my life

Everywhere I turn, I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Everytime you smile, angels cry
Everytime you walk on by

I'm not the only, feeling lonely
Everytime you walk on by
I try to say something, but end up with nothing
Everytime you walk on by
Everytime you walk on by...

I keep my cool and pretend I'm not here
Everytime you come too near
I'm such a fool 'cause
This love is true and
If I don't tell you, someone else surely will

Everywhere I turn, I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Everytime you smile, angels cry
Everytime you walk on by

I'm not the only feeling lonely
Everytime you walk on by
I try to say something, but end up with nothing
Everytime you walk on by, yeah

If I ever see you again
This craziness must find an end
I look at you, I promise myself..

2X:
I'm not the only feeling lonely
Everytime you walk on by
I try to say something, but end up with nothing
Everytime you walk on by
