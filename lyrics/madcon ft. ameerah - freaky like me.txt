It was early in the morning
I hit a shower runnin
I almost got remember who this girl might be
And there she back, I couldn't believe my eyes
This pretty young thang with her eyes on me
I know you like It when I put my hands like that
Whisper in your ear, tell me how you like that
Game Freaky-eakyless what I do rust
So come a little closer, come a little closer

No one gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me, No-oone

We windin' and grindin', I bought you advises
Baby, you're like a fireburnin' motor on me
I know you like It when I put my hands like that
Whisper in your ear , tell me how you like that
Game Freaky-eakyless what I do rust
So come a little closer, come a little closer
No one gonna tell you to freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me
