Back to the music, back to the system (x6)
Allow me to reintroduce myself, hear me!
M-m-make some noise
I don't give a shit, I'm a hustler now
This is the life I choose
Back to the music, back to the system (x5)
To the music, to the system
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on!

This is the life I chose or rather the life that chose me
If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'd love me when I fade..
I don't give a shit, I'm a hustler now!
This is the life I chose
Middle finger to the Lord!
Fuck the world!
Won't stop abusing it, the groupie girl stop false accusing it
Allow me to reintroduce myself, hear me!

Make some noise!
I don't give a shit, I'm a hustler now!
This is the life I chose!
Middle finger to the lord! Fuck the world!
You know I'm not doin' it, in fact, I'm just redoing it
I don't give a shit, I'm a hustler now!
It's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on!

Middle finger to the Lord! Fuck the world!
Back to the music, back to the system (x16)

I ain't never scared
I'm everywhere
You ain't never there
Why would I ever care
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here
Excluding nobody
Look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
I'm supposed to be number one on everybodys list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this
