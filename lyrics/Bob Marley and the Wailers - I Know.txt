When the race gets hard to run
It means you just can't take the pace
When it's time to have your fun
You find the tears run on down through
Your face, then you stoand think a little
Are you the victim of the system
Anyday now they gonna let you down
Remember Natty Will be there
To see you through

And ain't it good to know now
JAH will be waiting there
Ain't it doggone good to know you all
JAH will be waiting there
Wait in Summer, wait in Spring
Waitin Autumn, Winter thing
Tribe goes up, all the tribe goes down
Bring my children from the end of the earth

Many a time I sit and wonder why
This race so, so very hard to run
Then I say to my soul take courage
Battle to be won
Like a ship that's tossed and driven
Battered by the angry sea yeah!
Say the tide of time was raging
Don't let the fury fall on me, No, No, No

Cause I know JAH will be waiting there
Ain't it good to know now
JAH will be waiting there
Lost and found, who speak I give
Speak I give, lost and found (Repeat)
