ohh
mmm

take off my shirt loosen the buttons
and undo my skirt
stare at myself in the mirror
pick me apart piece by piece.
sorrow decrease
pressure release
i put in work
did more than called upon, more than deserved
when it was over , did i wind up hurt? (yes)
but it taught me before a decision ask this question first
who am i living for?
ooh yeah
is this my limit?
can i endure some more
Chances i'm Giving.

Take off my cool show them that under here

I'm just like you
do the mistakes I make make me a fool
or a human with flaws
admit that I lost
Round of applause
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment
Is That An Excuse?(noo)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose

who am I living for? (oh)
is this my limit?
can I endure some more?
Chances I'm giving.

dear diary,
It's Robyn.
Entertaining is something I do for a living.
It's not who I am.
I like to think that I'm normal.
I laugh.
I get mad.
I hurt.
I think I suck sometimes.
But when you're in the spot light everything seems good. (Oooh Yeah) Sometimes I feel like I have it worst cuz I always have to keep my guard up.
I dont know who to trust.
I dont know who wants to date me for who i am.
Or who wants to be my friend for who I REALLY am.
