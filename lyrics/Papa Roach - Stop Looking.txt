Hit or miss
Fuck or fight
It's time to live your life 
Go ahead
I know I'm right 
I'm gonna lay it on the line
Put yourself
In my shoes 
Would you stand up for your rights?
Line 'em up
And knock 'em down 
I'm not running scared tonight 

I have found these walls before 
And I'm not scared anymore 
There's a time to lead and a time to follow 
'Cause I won't take this anymore (these walls)
I've climbed these walls before (these walls)
There's a time to lead and a time to follow 

I see the wall
I'm closing in 
And I feel like I'm in danger 
My enemy
Is not alone 
In the mirror there's a stranger 
As I tried
To break out 
My panic lead to fear 
Hopeless, I am alone 
I'm afraid the end is near 

The truth doesn't always have to hurt 

I have climbed these walls before 
And I'm not scared anymore 
There's a time to lead and a time to follow 
'Cause I won't take this anymore (these walls)
I've climbed these walls before (these walls)
There's a time to lead and a time to follow 

Stop looking, start seeing now!
Right now! [x2]

The truth doesn't always have to hurt 

I have climbed these walls before 
And I'm not scared anymore 
There's a time to lead and a time to follow 
'Cause I won't take this anymore (these walls)
I've climbed these walls before (these walls)
There's a time to lead and a time to follow

I have climbed these walls before 
There's a time to lead and a time to follow 
I have climbed these walls before 
There's a time to lead and a time to follow 
And I'll never be the same 
And I'll never be the same 
Why does the truth
Always have to always hurt?
