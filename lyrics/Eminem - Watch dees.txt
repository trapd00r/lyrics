(Thirstin Howl)
I hit harder than four men,
Landing both gloves to a low blow with no cup
Leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls ,through helmets,
with the penetration of a screw ,nailed in,
return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles we pour blood and toast death to wicked infants
found on the sorceress  ,doorsteps,
Slaughter lamb ,and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure
Language unfam-i-liar
Art through a flooded air brush
Road leave craft
Sentences joined with words holding hands
it's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landing in exact time flight leaves.

Watch deez
Watch deez

Watch deez
Don't watch that, watch deez

(Eminem)
Who's arm is this?
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
Who refused to renew my seventh presciption of Darvecets(Sorry)
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
And never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
That's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich,and just ate the knife,
My mother's screaming 'please heal and take him straight to Christ'
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice
bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm fallin out of my bed
Found it red and my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
Occurring usually during pain for release in my urine
Screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
These pills keep screamin' :"please quit swoalloin' me"
The devil keeps screamin':"please get down on one knee"
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me.
