Thick bitch named Tammy
Rockstar Lifestyle baby, Hennessy and a Plan B

Riding through my city smoking, swerving with my niggas, yeah
I won't stop until these hoes love, and my pockets just can't get no bigger, yeah
Fake niggas claim they from my city, but they stuntin' for the fans on Twitter, yeah
All the ones that said I wouldn't make it out claiming that they is my niggas

[Verse 3: Theo Moralz]
I might just pour at the store
They think I'm overflowing, and end up hoping that he know it
She calling my phone like "where the hell you think you're going?"
I told her, "hoe, I'm busy touring"
You can catch me overseas
All these niggas overseen
Drowning, moving, couldn't dream
Got me thinking I'm insane
A lot of things I could've been
[?]
Think I need a little weed, yeah
Really thought that I could keep ya
You kept saying that you need me
I pop it, and I finish going, suck and fuck, you gotta go
I could never love a hoe, had to leave 'em at the door
Better, now she needed more, started taking off her clothes
You was never down to ride
But now you want to spend my time
Just to fuck with your mind
Post a pic, I need a like
Now you see me, I'm on the grind
I ain't chasing you behind
You said you love me, that's a lie
You're gonna see me on the rise
My heart is so cold, the top is just so close
Don't want you no more, no
So leave me alone
We light up and blow, my team on the roll
And you should've known
And you should've known, yeah
