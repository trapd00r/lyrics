Mustard on that beat

Look in the mirror
Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show, which role should I take?
Fading to gray, so do we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show, baby, just put me on display

Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

I have no secrets
'Cause there's a version of me that I don't know how to hide
When you're making me glow with your fingers against my thighs
(Glow)

Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

Nothing on my body but this mood ring
This mood ring, mm

I'm in the palm of your hand
My temperature is at your command
By my demand
And now I'm falling for you
I turn to golden from blue
And you do too, ah

I think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

Yeah
Hey
Hey
