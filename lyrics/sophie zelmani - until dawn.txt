I wonder, I wonder about the fire
One fire I seen to be stuck with
It's glowing, and burning,
and sparkling of flames
I wonder who set it free

And I don't know just what to do
It's like I could, get crazy
about you
My fire burns until dawn
My fire burns until dawn

I wonder about the sun
over the brook
I wonder about the genious
and the fool
I wonder about reasons
and what it would take
to use their power
for their own sake

And I don't know just what to do
It's like I could get crazy
about you
My fire burns until dawn
My fire burns until dawn
