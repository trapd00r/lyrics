Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She got the stereo with the big guitars
And that's all right
Yeah (All right)

I got the itch and a restless soul
She gone with the wind, gonna go for broke tonight, yeah
And that's (All night)

Girl, we've been meant for this since we were born (Since we were born)
No problems now, coast is clear (Ooh)
It's just the calm before the storm

This must be just like livin' in paradise (Just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (And I don't want to go)
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't wanna go home

Suzy, Suzy, girl, for cryin' out loud
You got all the right moves, you make me eat my heart out
Nightly, aw (That's all right with me)
Yeah

No special favors, make it out to cash
We'll spend it later, got to make this romance last
And (Last)
That's it, that's it

Some folks say easy come is easy go (And some folks say)
But one night ain't enough for me
Girl, hang on tight and don't let go

This must be just like livin' in paradise (It's just like paradise, hey)
And I don't wanna go home (And I ain't never goin' home)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (Just like, just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home

Whoo, this must be just like livin' in paradise (In paradise, paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (And I don't, I don't wanna go)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (Come on, ah, come on)
And I don't wanna go home (Wow, 1-800-SEE-YA, baby)

This must be just like livin' in paradise (Just like, just like)
And I don't wanna go home (Wow, hey hey)
(Just like paradise, just like) This must be just like livin' in paradise
