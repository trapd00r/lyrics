Dooh, watching me, hanging by a string this time
Doh, easily the climax of a perfect life
Dooh, watching me, hanging by a string this time
Doh, easily, my smile's worth a hundred lies

And if there's lessons to be learned, I'd rather get my jamming words in first oh
Tell ya something that I've found, that the world's a better place when it's upside down boy
And if there's lessons to be learned, I'd rather get my jamming words in first oh
When you're playing with desire, don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy

Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah

Blue, blue, blue, waves they crash
As time goes by, so hard to catch
And too, too smooth, ain't all that
Why don't you ride my side of the tracks

And if there's lessons to be learned, I'd rather get my jamming words in first oh
Tell ya something that I've found, that the world's a better place when it's upside down boy
And if there's lessons to be learned, I'd rather get my jamming words in first oh
When you're playing with desire, don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy

Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me, nothing sweet about me, yeah
