I am he is you are he is you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation t-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Mister city policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying
I'm cry
I'm crying
I'm cry
Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Man, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob, g'goo goo g'joob

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan from standing in the English rain

'Cause I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
And I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob, g'goo goo g'joob

Expert textpert choking smokers, don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina Pilchard's climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

I am the eggman
We are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob, g'goo goo g'joob
G'goo goo g'joob, g'goo goo g'joob, g'goo
Joob joob joob-a
G'joob joob joob-a
G'joob joob joob-a
G'joob joob joob-a
G'joob joob joob-a
