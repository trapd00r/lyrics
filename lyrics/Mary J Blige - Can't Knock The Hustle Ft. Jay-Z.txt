I'm makin' sure it turns gold, when the weather folds,
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold,
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willy,
Hi-stakes, I got more at stake than philly,
Shopping sprees, coppin 3, deuce fever I.S'n,
Fully loaded, ah yes,
Bouncin' in the lex luger, tires smoke like budah,
50 g's to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me,
Chrome stocks beamin, through my peripheral,
I see you schemin, stop dreamin', I'll leave ya body steamin,
Niggas is fiendin, what's the meanin'?,
I'm leanin on any nigga intervenin with the sound of my money machine'n,
My cup's runneth, over with hundreds,
I'm one of the best niggas that done it,
6 digits and runnin', y'all niggas don't want it,
I got the godfather flow, the don juan demarco,
Swear to god don't get if fucked up

Takin' out this time,
To give you a piece of my mind,
'Cause you can't knock the hustle,
Who do you think you are?,
Wel baby one day you'll be a star

Last seen outta state, where I dropped my slang,
I'm deep in the south, kickin up top game,
Bouncin' on the highways, switchin 4 lanes,
Screaming though the sunroof money ain't a thing,
Your worst fear confirmed, me and my fam roll tight like the firm,
Gettin' down for life, that's right, you better learn,
Why play when fire burns?,
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire,
We do dirt like worms, produce g's like sperm,
Till legs spread like germs,
I get extensive hoes, with expensive clothes,
And I sip fine wines, and spit vintage flows,
What y'all don't know?
'Cause ya can't knock the hustle

Runnin' till the late day, I'm the one whos crazy,
'Cause that's the way you're makin' me be, (the way you make me feel),
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
I'm just tryin' to get mine, I don't have the time,
To knock the hustle for real

Y'all niggas lunchin, punchin the clock,
My function, is to make much and lay back munchin,
Sippin remy on the rocks, my crew, somethin' to watch,
Nothin' to stop, un-stoppable,
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hide ya crew,
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like movado,
My motto, stack rocks like colorado,
While I order champagne, kristals by the bottle,
It's a damn shame, what ya not though, me,
Slick like a gato (cat), fuckin' jay-z,
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me,
He tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what!,
Straight bananas, can a nigga, see me,
Got the U.S Open, advantage jigga,
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a canvas,
Le tigre, son you're too eager,
You ain't havin' it?, good, me either,
Lets, get together and make this whole world believers huh,
At my arraignment, screamin,
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment,
Until we even, leavin', as long as I'm breathin,
Can't knock the way a nigga eatin, fuck you even, (fuck you)

Takin' out this time,
To give you a piece of my mind,
Who do you think you are?,
Well baby one day you'll be a star

Runnin' till the late day, I'm the one whos crazy,
'Cause that's the way you're makin' me be, (the way you make me feel),
I'm just tryin' to get mine, I don't have the time,
To knock the hustle for real
