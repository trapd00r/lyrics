I don't know why I never told you...
And I don't know why I never tried...
When we shed these bitter skins again... (Skins again...)
All the reasons come to life...

And now it's over...
Now it's over...
Now it's over...
Now it's over...

I don't know why you never asked me...
And I don't know why you never cared...
When we hide these little sins again... (Sins again...)
All the reasons have to die...

But now it's over...
Now it's over...
And now it's over...
And now it's over...

And now it's over!
And now it's over!
And now it's over!
And now it's over!

No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
