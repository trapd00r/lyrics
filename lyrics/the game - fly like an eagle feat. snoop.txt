(Whoo Kid) Damn

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I'm fly like an eagle
Live my life so illegal

[50 Cent:] Come on and give it to me baby

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
When will you niggas ever learn
That time is money and money gets yo ass burned
Learn, from the niggas that done before I had a chance
You know, the ones with the Chucks and the Khaki pants
Used to tell me all the time bang lil' man
Took yo advice now my life is a paradise
Happenin, ghetto fabulous, estabalished since 1990

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I'm fly like an eagle
Live my life so illegal

See the evil eye
We do or die

I'm fly like an eagle
Live my life so illegal
We gon ride at ya people
See the evil eye
We do or die

[Whoo Kid:] Black Wall Street, west coast, non stop

[Verse 2: The Game]
Straight out the muthafuckin town of gin
With my blues on, G Unit shoes on baby mama on the way
Jump in the Regal throw Snoop on
Back to the hood to get my motherfuckin Gin and my juice on
It ain't been too long cause Dub still got spinners on the Lac
And half on the dub sac
If you smokin then hit it and pass it to the left
If you ain't got nothing on it homie you smoking stress
Niggas see me and wanna bang they hood
I don't know why when half you niggas is scared of Suge
Nigga I put it down for my muthafuckin' hood
With my niggas WC and Snoop, East Wood
I'm surrounded by legends West Coast rap veterans
And we bangin the pound to West Side Connection
64 Chevy when I wheely off the block
Its still 187 on a muthafuckin' cop

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I'm fly like an eagle
Live my life so illegal
We gon ride at ya people
See the evil eye
We do or die

[Whoo Kid:] (Wooo Can't forget Tony, U.K. B.I.G.)

I'm fly like an eagle
Live my life so illegal
We gon ride at ya people
See the evil eye
We do or die

[50 Cent:] Come on and give it to me baby

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah Its gotta be something about the way I'm dressing or the way I move
That gets em bent over stretching anyway I choose
5 O'Clock in the morning alarm clock on snooze
Wake up exchange a number that I'm not gon' use
A tricks the only reason that she got on shoes
But I stick to the hot dog and pop corn rules
Dedicated to the game I'm not gon lose
I'm gettin change so I got more jewels
You know what its like to cruise through the avenue
Go shoppin and have a hundred niggas mad at you
Stalkers knockin at ya door cause I had a few
Leave the stage with a crowd of bitches grabbin you
Probally not, I got a angel who won't say a curse
A rap bitch thats always beggin me to say a verse
It don't really matter the way I say it it works
First I play in ya shirt then I play around in ya purse

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I'm fly like an eagle
Live my life so illegal
We gon ride at ya people
See the evil eye
We do or die

[Whoo Kid:] (come on, Can't forget, Ron Gillian)

I'm fly like an eagle
Live my life so illegal
We gon ride at ya people
See the evil eye
We do or die

[Whoo Kid:] (Interscope, Jimmy Iovine Whoo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiid)

[50 Cent:] Come on and give it to me baby

[Verse 4: WC]
Dub sizzle, Dogg Pound and Black Wall Street
Three niggas ready to ride get bandanas in pocket
And we keep the party jumpin like 'draulics
Gangsta shit, I was raised off that
Off Yak and gold back like suede golf hats
I don't spit fire I spit terror
From the local jams homie in the sports arena gangbangin'
I ain't identical I'm one of the most original
With this gun and pistol when I bang South Central
I represent swing I don't rep no post
Cuz niggas ain't willin to die like I'll die for most
I ain't fallin off my hustle
And I keep a fresh pair off Busta knuckles
WC bitch I been rich and still ride in the Regal
And I'm fly as a muthafuckin eagle

[WC Talkin:]
Thats it right there
Black Wall Street, Swing, Dogg Pound world wide baby
