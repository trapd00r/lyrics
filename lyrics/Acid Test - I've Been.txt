O-o-o-o-oh
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Yeeeh
Am I coming through?
Am I coming through?
Is this sweet and pure and true?

Devil came by this morning
Said he had
Something to show me
I was looking like I've never seen a face before
Here we go now, let's slide into the open door

Pictures and things that I've done before
Circling around me
Out here on the floor
I'm dreaming this and I'm dreaming that
Regretting nothing
Think about that

I'm seeing waves breaking form to my horizon
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking form to my horizon
Lord, I'm shining

Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain
Where I've been
You know I've almost lost my mind
I can't explain
Where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain
What I've seen

I'm happy now to have seen it
To find that the images are fading away

I'm seeing waves breaking forms to my horizon
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking forms to my horizon, lord
I'm shining yeah
Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
Are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?

You know I almost lost my mind
I can't explain
Where I've been
You know I almost lost my mind
I couldn't explain
The things I've seen
But now I think I see the light
Now I think I see the light

Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand
Lend me your hand

I'm seeing waves breaking form to my horizon
Yeah I'm shining
I'm seeing waves breaking form to my horizon, lord
I'm shining

Oh are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you
Oh are you hearing me?
Like I'm hearing you?
[Repeat]

You know I almost lost my mind
Now I'm home, and I'm free

Did I pass the acid test?
Did I pass the acid test?
[Repeat]

You'd better go to bed now
[Repeat]
