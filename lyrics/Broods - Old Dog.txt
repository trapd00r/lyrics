Back then I was new
I knew nothing but to follow (nothing but to follow)
Was it pop looking after you?
Was she scared and never coming back? (Bye bye)
This bitch, won't come, won't sit, won't get
You'll stay (no, no, no, no)
I'm diggin' down on the shit

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'm diggin' down on the shit
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Just another mind to mould
Do I look a stray wandering around with nowhere to go?
Just a puppy playing in the streets
They say, "I just feel so sorry for it who is gonna be there to teach?"
No, I don't feel alone
Even on the nights that nobody wants to hold me
I don't need you to show me
How to be a lady
I'm an animal, baby

I'm an old dog now
Tried to wash off my fleas
Get your piss of my treats
I'm an old dog now
I'm not here just to please
Get that leash off of me
I'm an old dog now (ooh)
Tried to wash off my fleas
Get your piss of my treats
I'm an old dog now (ooh)
I'm not here just to please
Get that leash off of me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm an old dog now
Tried to wash off my fleas
Get your piss of my treats
I'm an old dog now
I'm not here just to please
Get that leash off of me
I'm an old dog now (ooh)
Tried to wash off my fleas
Get your piss of my treats
I'm an old dog now (ooh)
I'm not here just to please
Get that leash off of me
