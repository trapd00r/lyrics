Why do I stay, why do I stay in love
Ooh (oh)
(Why do I stay, why do I stay in love)
Oh baby
Baby, I stay in love with you

Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make up, break up can't take this madness
We don't even really know (why) all I know is baby I
Try and try so hard to keep our love alive

If you don't know me at this point then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me that unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it
From our hearts and minds and I know

We said let it go but I kept on hangin' on
Inside I know it's over you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby I stay in love with you

And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "Oh well" each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
Baby baby, I stay in love with you

It cuts so deep it hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me I ain't the same no more
We still need each other
When we stumble and fall how

We gon' act like what we had
Ain't nothing at all now
Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down like we used to

Hit the block proud in the SU
We both know our heart is breakin'
Can we learn from our mistakes
I can't last one moment alone, although I know

We said let go but I kept on hangin' on
Inside I know it's over you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby baby, I stay in love with you

And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "Oh well" each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now no matter what I do
Baby baby, I stay in love with you

We said let go but I kept on hangin' on
Inside I know it's over you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby baby, I stay in love with you

And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "Oh well" each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now no matter what I do
Baby baby, I stay in love with you
