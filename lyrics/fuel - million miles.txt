On my way for the day I find no sorrow
Everyday is all the same there's no tommorow
And I feel like I feel
Cause it's cold here where you left me

Hey I think that someday I might need you somehow
I, I think I might have loved you
These things I said but you were
A million miles away
A million miles away

On my way for the day I find my heart is not for taking
And I know it's all but gone
It only served to make me cry
And I feel like I feel
Cause its black here with your memory

Hey I think that someday I might need you somehow
I, I think I might have loved you
These things I said but you were
A million miles away
A million miles away

A million miles
A million miles
A million miles away

These things I said but you were
A million miles
A million miles

Hey I think that someday I might need you somehow
I, I think I might have loved you
These things I said but you were
A million miles away

On my way for the day I find no sorrow
