Play with me
Lie to me
Love me

Chorus : C'mon and lie with me
C'mon and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one... x 4

Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Don't mean a lot now

Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive

Promises made for covenience
Aren't necessarily
What we need

Truth is a word
That's lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth

Play with me
Love me
