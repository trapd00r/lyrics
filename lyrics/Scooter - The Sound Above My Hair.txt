Listen!

Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere

Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere

Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere

Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
Lights in the sky, and in my eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's party everywhere

Here I go
Out to rave again
Hardcore fills the air
The sound above my hair
