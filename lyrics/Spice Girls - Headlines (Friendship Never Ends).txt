Emma:
The time is now or never
To fit the missing piece
To take this on together
You make me feel complete
We fall into the future
And through the looking glass
The light shines over our heads
And so it comes to pass

Geri and Emma:
To go beyond the surface
To reach into your soul
This love is not demanding
My heart has told me so
I hold onto my hero (Melanie B: ah, ah, ah)
With faith enough to fly
The power to imagine
Will keep this love alive

All:
Let's make the headlines loud and true
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you
Let's make the headlines loud and clear
The best things suddenly happen when you are near
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven
Never leave me alone (Emma: everything)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (Emma: matters when you're near)

Melanie C:
And it feels so good
Every bell's gonna ring
Your love is alive and it's makin' me sing
I could fly, wanna cry
Want the whole world to know
We are together
Come on baby, lets go

Victoria and Emma:
And words yet to be spoken
Will fall upon the page
Spelling out true devotion
Is all we need to say

All:
Let's make the headlines loud and true (Victoria: say you love me and I'll say I love you too)
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you (Victoria: just remember what simple words can do)
Let's make the headlines loud and clear (Victoria: all that I have I give to you my friend)
The best things suddenly happen when you are near (Victoria: just remember that friendship never ends)
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven
Never leave me alone (Emma: everything)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (Emma: matters when you're near)
Victoria:
Say you love me and I'll say I love you too

All:
Let's make the headlines true this time (Victoria: just remember what simple words can do)
There's no hiding from this magical state of mind (Melanie C: I feel loved with you, I feel love)
If I lost my way you'd carry me home (Melanie C: I Know You'd Take Me All the way to heaven)
Take me all the way to heaven never leave me alone
And it's just like everything matters when you are near (Melanie C: Everything Matters, it really matters)
Let's make the headlines loud and true (Melanie C:I feel love, I feel, I feel love)
Let's make the headlines

Melanie B:
'Cause I'm giving it all
Yeah I'm giving it all to you.
