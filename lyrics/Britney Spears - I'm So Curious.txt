So curious
So curious

I'm so curious
About our love
I don't understand
Why you don't take my hand
And tell me you care (you care)
I see all the signs
But if you wanna be mine
Don't leave me up in the air

Oh baby
You better let your love show
Here's what I'm telling you
Let me know
Let me go

I'm so curious
Do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? (I do)
I'm so curious
What do you think of me
Boy am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?

So curious
So curious

I'm so curious
About our love
If it's make believe
Why don't you set my heart free
And tell me goodbye? (goodbye)
But if it's for real
Tell me you feel for me
Way deep down inside

Oh baby
Is this goodbye or hello?
Here's what I'm telling you
Let me know
Let me go

I'm so curious
Do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? (I do)
I'm so curious
What do you think of me
Boy am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?

So curious
Yeah, yeah

All day and night I just dream of you (of you)
I think about all the things that we could do
I'm dying for and I'm feeling for the day
When you could open up and say
You feel the same
You feel like I do
Yeah

I'm so curious
Do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? (I do)
I'm so curious
What do you think of me
Boy am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?

I'm so curious
Do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? (I do)
I'm so curious
What do you think of me
Boy am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?

Do you love me?
Do you wonder the way that I do? (I do)
I'm so curious
What do you think of me
Boy am I just a game
Or do you feel the same as I do?
