Love isn't funny
When it is burning inside
When all you think of
Is how to get through the night
And when you want it
It's just a game that you play
And when you get it
They're gonna take it away

Maybe it's nothing
Maybe it's all just in my mind
Maybe I'm foolish
Maybe it's just a waste of time

But I don't think so
Maybe I definately know
That maybe
Maybe I'm in love

Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da

So if you want it
You wanna come out to play
Then you can have it
Cos he's got plans for the day
And if I want it
There's no one out there for me
When you don't need it
There's plenty fish in the sea

Maybe it's nothing
Maybe it's all just in my mind
Maybe I'm foolish
Maybe it's just a waste of time

But I don't think so
Maybe I definately know
Why do I keep fooling myself
Why can't I let go
This is not like me
But now I definately see
That maybe (oh-oh-oh-oh maybe)
Maybe I'm in love

But I don't think so (but I don't think so)
Maybe I definately know (oh-oh-oh)
Why do I keep fooling myself (why)
Why can't I let go (why can't I let go)
This is not like me (this is not like me)
But now I definately see (definately)
That maybe (oh-oh-oh-oh maybe)
Maybe I'm in love
