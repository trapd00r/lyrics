Yo, Special turn it up
There's nothing I won't do
Anything you want me to
I can't keep my hands of you
There's nothing I won't do
And so I don't know why
No matter how I try
I can't wave my dreams goodbye 

Wave my dreams goodbye

There's nothing I won't do
Anything you want me to
I can't keep my hands of you
There's nothing I won't do
And so I don't know why
No matter how I try
I can't wave my dreams goodbye

There's nothing I won't do

Kick it
I wanna see you move your as like it's on fire 
I wanna feel the bass

Damn it's gettin' hot 

Here we go again!

Come on

There's nothing I won't do
Anything you want me to
I can't keep my hands of you
There's nothing I won't do
And so I don't know why
No matter how I try
I can't wave my dreams goodbye

There's nothing I won't do

Let's make love

Yeah, yeah
Yo, welcome ladies and gentleman

Here we go
Welcome all you headbanging booty shaking
Rumb bumpin' beat bouncin'
