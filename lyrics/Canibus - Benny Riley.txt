DJ's, cuttin' up beats and stuff like that and
That was my first exposure to the whole, artistry in hip-hop
There is nothing in this music, that I don't wanna hear
There is words, that are kind of syncopated and rhythmic
And there's this hot drum track, it's great!

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
"This is, this is great! This is, this is great!"
And I could hear, this enormous
"This is, this is great! This is, this is great!"
This is music, I've been waiting all my life to hear

(Canibus)
Ayo
I don't give a fuck if you getting some cash, or getting some ass
If I was there, I'd pick up the tab
Toss you a rag, tell you to wipe your stinking ass
Get back to the lab, make sure Hip-Hop lasts
Do death before dishonor, I do this 'cause I wanna
Your body armor don't protect you from your karma
Ready for the encounter, like a titty-bar bouncer
Or Muhammed in the Mini-Mart counter with four-pounders
Quick-draw, McGraw spitter
Let me see you hands jitter, I'll hit you where the good Lord split you
You faggot ass niggas' is see-through
I treat you like we in the same cell, but I'm Bugsy Segal
Smack your teeth loose, for street juice
Go to court in cheap-suits, giving testimony over beat-loops
Take them to my hood, show the evil I'm from
They can't blame me for the evil I've done, now they see why I run
Why I keep a tight leash on the gun
Why my speech is so revered by the young, 'cause my spirit is young
A nigga spitting like that, got serious lungs
Yo, I'm serious son, he a furious one

(Canibus)
Yo
The name Benny Riley, the trip took twenty-eight days
From New-York to Cali, driving through alleys
My mom mad at me, my dad laughs at me
My life's a tragedy, I need this record deal
Precious, she got the freshest breasts'
And an ass from heaven; thirty-six, twenty-four, thirty-seven
She the second broad I ever humped under a bridge
But she the first broad I ever fucked within the record 'biz
Desi told her I was crazy, and she called the Feds
The bitch didn't know any better; I let her live
She don't know Desi is a greasy fucking pig
And he set me up for something he knows I never did
When I see him, I'ma put the Smith and Wesson to his head
To change his outlook on life, maybe I'll show him what it's like to be dead
Like the way I look at lyrics
I kill it till they dead; it's that vivid
Got skills to kill the rap business
Got bills to put a contract on the witness if he rat-snitching
Niggas' in the back, digging holes for your next acting role
Get buried with your cash and gold
Your assets sold, your family Marlon Brando broke
Shattered hopes, rapper's joke, took it like a man though
Benny Riley is the closest thing to Canibus yo
Niggas' just don't be understanding his flow, until the hammer let go
Grab the mic and cold damage the show
Get split with bananas flows, at the Canibus Bowl

This is music, I've been waiting all my life to hear
And I didn't know it
