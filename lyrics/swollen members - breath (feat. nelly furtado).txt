Nelly Furtado:
I'm alive
I can feel the blood
Rushing through my veins
And that's all I need to know
'Cause I'm not lookin' for a change
'Cause I got friends and enemies
But it just don't bother me
'Cause as long as I believe
I can breathe!

Metamorphosis, Battle Axe fortress
Four hundred horsepower
Full moon the sorceress
Swollen Members and my girl NF
The predators and the terminator
The track's called Breath
Why hurt 'em later?
We can do so much damage now
Dump truck 'em when I hit em
So much garbage around
Yells, bells, and whistles
Like carnival sounds
Phenomenal adrenaline
From the words of my mouth

How did Shane manage to rap?
With brain damage I'm phat
Remain famished and stacked
Your playin' with the
Praying mantis
In fact you gigantic
You sink like Titanic
Panic attack act up
And I'm a Mack Truck
Crash into disaster
Smash like Master Blaster
Punker, Rangle-monster wants to stomp ya
Crush 'em 'cause I'm vain
Question that remains
Will tomorrow be the same
Blood rushing through my veins?

Nelly Furtado:
I'm alive
I can feel the blood
Rushing through my veins
And that's all I need to know
'Cause I'm not lookin' for a change
'Cause I got friends and enemies
But it just don't bother me
'Cause as long as I believe
I can breathe!

Nelly Furtado:
I know this before I knew how to
Now we are of this point to do
What a deeper subject to do
Better it be easy or not to do
I know this before I knew how to
Now we are of this point to do
What a deeper subject to do
Better it be easy or not to do

I savor the mouth
I'm like a Krispy Kreme conveyor belt
With the synth notes
Swollen like your lymph nodes
We went from instro to intro to instore
Coincidentally
Messin' up your mental state
We makin' pens glow
Pacific central pay me
And my kinsfolk attention
Nobody can do it like your man Mok'
My bands dope!
The tracks flow
I'm beautiful
That's fo' sho'!

The harmony queen
The decibel kings
Inevitable but we were born to do incredible things
I let it ring like freedom
Swing letters from my jaw
Twenty six in the mix
And we do it better than y'all

I'm a Neanderthal
Your bound to fall
I'm born to ball
We warned you all
Its foreign to y'all

Its wonderful the underworld
Beautiful minds
Tryin' to keep it independent
In recruitable times

Nelly Furtado:
I know this before I knew how to
Now we are of this point to do
What a deeper subject to do
Better it be easy or not to do
I know this before I knew how to
Now we are of this point to do
What a deeper subject to do
Better it be easy or not to do

We crashin' through you
Now feel the magnitude
What passion do
Inside of you
It has to do with how
You do your thing
Be true to only you
What Moka Only's
Tellin' you
Is take your soul and talent to
The next plateau and balance
Who you try to think
No time to lose
