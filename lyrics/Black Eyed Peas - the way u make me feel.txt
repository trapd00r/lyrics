I dream of holding you tight
Crazy as I may seem
You're all that I ever need, baby
Everyday and all night
I dream of holding you tight
Crazy as I may seem
You're all that I ever need, baby

I gotta make you mine, you're someone I wanna own
I wanna be the one you call when you feelin' alone
I'm gonna make it easy for you to understand
You can be the infamous woman
That partner in hand could be me, pleasurable company
Gettin' you like enter, when I feel on your body
It done hit me like "Please"
You movin' authentic 'cause energy sent to me knees that
Make em buckle, baby
Speakin' a buckle
Why don't you undo yours, and make our body hustle
Isn't it love when two body collide
Lettin' all sparks that resembles Fourth of July skies
And you know how much I care about you right 
Oh yeah
When you're on my mind, I'm a be alright 
Oh yeah
I wanna love you down in so many ways 
Oh yeah
When I'm feeling blue, I think of you and say 
Oh yeah
And if you knew how deep I feel about you girl, then you will
Not think twice when I ask to hook up and go chill
It could be in my place 
On my place
Or your place 
Or your place
And we could let our body conversate, 'cause

Everyday and all night
I dream of holding you tight
Crazy as I may seem
You're all that I ever need, baby
Everyday and all night
I dream of holding you tight
Crazy as I may seem
You're all that I ever need, baby

This ain't no attempt to get all up in your jeans
Even though I wanna make you scream to extreme
Our mouths give you chocolate treats like Halloween
Act out scenes where you and I wrote, my scene 'cause it's
Something in the way you make me feel
You got me feelin' like I'm supposed to feel
Just you and I, up close and personal
I'll be gentle while you lettin' your emotional feel
And you got it good like that
When you and I interact you'll be whipped on contact
'Cause once you Will, you never go back
Baby, once you go Will, you never go back
I said how much I care about you right 
Oh yeah
When you on my mind, I'm a be alright 
Oh yeah
I wanna love you down in so many ways 
Oh yeah
When I'm feeling blue, I think of you and say 
Oh yeah
And since you knew how deep I feel about you girl, then you will
Not think twice when I ask to hook up and go chill
It could be in my place 
On my place
Or your place 
Or your place
And we could let our body conversate, 'cause
