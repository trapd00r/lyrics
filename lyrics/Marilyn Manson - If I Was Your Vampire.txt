It's 6 AM, Christmas morning
No shadows, no reflections here
Lying cheek-to-cheek in your cold embrace

So soft and so tragic
As a slaughterhouse, you press the knife against your heart
And say that: "I love you so much, you must kill me now."
"I love you so much, you must kill me now."

If I was your vampire
Soon as the moon
Instead of killing time we'd have each other 'til the sun
If I was your vampire
Death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come

Taking your smile apart
With my spade tongue
And the hole is where the heart is

We built this tomb together
I will fill it alone
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back

If I was your vampire
Soon as the moon
Instead of killing time we'd have each other 'til the sun
If I was your vampire
Death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come

Bloodstained sheets in the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
Bloodstained sheets in the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again

6:19 and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain, you'll burn and I'll eat your ashes
It's possible we're seducing your corpse

If I was your vampire
Soon as the moon
Instead of killing time we'd have each other 'til the sun
If I was your vampire
Death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come
(Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back)

This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
