Prayed in the ghetto
With my face in the cement
Heard the last moan of a boxer
Seen the massacre of the innocent

Felt around for the light switch
Felt around for her face
Been treated like a farm animal
On a wild goose chase

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain risin' on a new age
See the groom still waitin' at the altar

Try to be pure at heart
They arrest you for robbery
Mistake your shyness for aloofness
Your shyness for snobbery

Got the message this morning
The one that was sent to me
About the madness of becomin'
What one was never meant to be

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain risin' on a new age
See the groom still waitin' at the altar

Don't know what I can say about Claudette
Wouldn't come back to haunt me
Finally had to give her up
'Bout the time she began to want me

But I know God has mercy
On them who are slandered and humiliated
I'd a-done anything for that woman
If she'd only make me feel obligated

West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waitin' at the altar

Put your hand on my head, baby
Do I have a temperature?
I see people who are supposed to know better
Standin' around like furniture

There's a wall between you
What you want and you got to leap it
Tonight you got the power to take it
Tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain risin' on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Cities on fire
Phones out of order
They're killing nuns and soldiers
There's fighting on the border

What can I say about Claudette?
Ain't seen her since January
She could be respectably married
Or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires

West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turnin' of the page
Curtain risin' on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar
