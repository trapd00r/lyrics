Its its its its its... murda!

Wait stop the questions please
I've been on my knees
Beggin these disease
To stop from killin' these
Messed up cronic crease
Of the diseased

Uh oh
Letz go slow
On the radio low
Down south where they know
How it's gonna be
I said its murda (murda!)
To me
I don't need no ****in c

(Reapeat chorus)

Reapeat the laws
Dynamite flaws
All over yaws
Dis ting ain't no joke
Just go slow
To the hip hop show
Uh oh uh oh

Datz it for me
But wait till ya see
What's next for the
Slim shady
