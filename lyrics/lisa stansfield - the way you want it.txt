Peepin' through your window
You spy me walkin' to your door
Maybe you are havin' second thoughts
Like you did before, boy
There's no hesitation on my part
I want all I can get
Boy you're playing with a naked flame
And there's not much you can do about it

Do it just the way you want it
Do it just the way you feel
Do it like you always like to do
Do it like you always wanted to

Baby, don't be foolish
It's what you've wanted all along
And don't you try to fight it
Because the force is far too strong

Do it just the way you want it
Do it just the way you feel
Do it like you always like to do
Do it like you always wanted to

Do it just the way you want it
Do it just the way you feel
Do it like you always like to do
Do it like you always wanted to

Baby, can't you see what's missin'

At this moment I would love to know 
What's going on inside your mind
Actions speak a lot louder than words
Don't worry, what you're doin' isn't a crime

Do it just the way you want it
Do it just the way you feel
Do it like you always like to do
Do it like you always wanted to

Do it just the way you want it
Do it just the way you feel
Do it like you always like to do
Do it like you always wanted to
