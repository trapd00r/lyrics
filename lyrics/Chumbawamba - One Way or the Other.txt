Peace won't come
Peace won't come
Peace won't come by words alone

There's a world in front of you
You've only got a certain space to go
I go to me factory and come back
That's supposed to be my bit of seeing the world
The whole world in front of you
The whole world to see and things that haven't been discovered

No pretty please, pretty pretty please [repeats]

One way or the other
Something's got to change
Humdrum has a stammer
Saying w-w-w-whatever
One way or the other

No pretty please, pretty pretty please [repeats]

Peace won't come by words alone
Peace won't come by words alone

I'm so low on order
But high on what I want
And I've got your number
And I'm coming over
One way or the other

No pretty please, pretty pretty please [repeats]

One way or the other
One way or the other

Peace won't come by words alone
Peace won't come by words alone
