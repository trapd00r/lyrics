Oh, oh 

Dear baby 
I'm not sorry 
For leaving you this way 
And I know I should have told you 
Face to face 
We've always been straight up 
So I won't waste your time 
I'm leaving  say goodbye because 
I know what you did last night 

[Chorus] 
Let me let you know  yeah 
That I'm leaving baby 
Let me let you know  yeah 
That I'm leaving baby 
Let me let you know 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm going far from here 
Let me let you know, yeah 
That I'm leaving baby, yeah, oh yeah 

One more thing before I go 
I hope you feel alone 
Cause I'm definitely tired of waiting 
For you to come home 
(Been waiting for you at home) 
We've always been straight up 
So I'll just take what's mine 
I'm leaving so say goodbye 
Cause you've heard me for the last time 

[Chorus] 

Whatever your excuse is 
I'm sure I've heard them all before 
Time and time again I told you 
That I needed more 
Now I'm walking out the door, oh 

[Chorus] 

Oh baby, I'm just here to let you know 
Oh yeah 
Here to let you know, oh 
Let me let you know, yeah 
I'm leaving 
Let me let you know 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm going far from here 
And let me let you know, yeah 
That I'm leaving baby, yeah, oh yeah 
Let me let you know 
I don't know where I'm going 
But I'm going far from here 
Let me let you know, yeah 
That I'm leaving baby, yeah, oh yeah
