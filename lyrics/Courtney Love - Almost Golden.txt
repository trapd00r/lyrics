How do you do the things
I'd never do to you
Oh no, what you do, The things
I'd never do to you 

Sorry 'bout the fire
Sorry 'bout the torch
Sorry I had to have my revenge
Send it in a note
Said you cannot go
Say you are sick you can't get dressed

Come on be on fire
Come on be a liar
My dress is the prettiest
Cover me in burns
Everyone take your turn
I'm already humiliated

My, oh my baby you do reflect the sun
And my, oh my baby you were Almost Golden
My, oh my, oh how you do reflect the sun, Yeah
And my, oh my baby you were Almost Golden

Sorry 'bout the fire
Sorry 'bout the torch
Sorry I had to have my revenge
Send it in a note
Say you cannot come
Say you are still tied to the bed

When's he gonna come?
When's he gonna spring?
When's he gonna crawl out in public?
When's he gonna come, screaming bombs away
When's he gonna kill me in this room

My, oh my he's in his glory yeah
Watch him tear me down with such a vengeance
Hold on to me, Yeah baby Hold on tight
Yeah, we'll just see which one of us gets out alive

Oh Honey you do all the things
I'll never do to you

Cover me in fire,
Cover me in lies,
That's just your entertainment
Sorry I'm upset
Walked a mile behind
I was stuck and you still in a daze

My, oh my you do reflect the sun
And my, oh my baby you were Almost Golden
And my, oh my baby, oh yeah you do reflect the sun,
And my, oh my baby you were Almost Golden
