Kanye West, Marvin Gaye, and GLC:
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah)
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) (Me too, I swear I do)
Past the sky (Every night, every night) (Yes, I feel you Ye, I feel you)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)

Kanye West:
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again, I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap, look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault, yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in, I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break next to the "No Smokin'" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writing my hits, writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him so I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle, y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle, you can't fathom my love
Dude, lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers
That's a Different World like Cree Summer's, I deserve to do these numbers
"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach"
So many records in my basement, I'm just waiting on my spaceship, wow

Kanye West, Tony Williams, and Marvin Gaye:
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)

GLC:
And I didn't even try to work a job, represent the mob at the same time
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind, lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love, that's not mine, "Why you ain't signed?" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all, half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball, never one to fall, got to get mine, got to take mine
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime, got to make these haters respect mine
In the mall until twelve when my schedule had said nine
Putting them pants on shelves waiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope
Holler at God, "Man why'd you have to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G., police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people counting on me and I'm just trying to find my peace
Should've finished school like my niece then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blow
Aw man, this pressure

Kanye West, Tony Williams, and Marvin Gaye:
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)

Consequence:
Man, you know you gon' do it
I remember having to take the dollar cab, coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day trying to make this thing right
And having one of my co-workers say "Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off till my spaceship takes off

Kanye West, Tony Williams, and Marvin Gaye:
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)

Tony Williams:
I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up and take me, brother, for a ride
Heaven knows, heaven knows
