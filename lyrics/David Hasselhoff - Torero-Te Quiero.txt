She was just a child when they fell in love
And he was everything that she'd been dreaming of
She was proud to be the princess of a brave matador
Cause she knew that it was her that he was always fighting for

She brings him Spanish roses
Cause she can still remember
All of the Spanish roses
Her lover gave to her

Torero
Te quiero
Torero
Te quiero

And now he's just a dream that she used to love
Cause deep inside her heart she'll hold the memory of
The days she used to watch him as the crowd cheered his name
To the day he lost the battle and they carried him away
