Oh you have played records all night long
You come straight from the club
When you pic me up at 6 in the morning
You smell of champagne and cigarettes!
I put on stockings and a dark green dress
And We're off to the clinic
10 girls in a room one bed each
I wonder if I am the only one who feels
Like everyone's staring at me
A nurse in the middle of the room
Informs us in a gentle Finnish accent
About the procedure
First they will sting us with the needle
Then we'll fall asleep
Then one by one they'll
Take us to the next room
Rid us of our little trouble
Our unwanted pregnancies!
And then we'll wake up
You are the only man in the room
You're by my side
When it's my turn to get injection
You are sent outside
- We've had aproblem with boyfriends
They often faint if they see blood,
The nurse explains
Just a few moments later I am sleeping
And if they exist the angels are weeping
And when I wake up,
You get me a coffee
And a sandwich
And a kiss in wich
I can taste the last breath of our love
And I can taste you haven't slept for centuries
And it's time to walk into
Our own separate winters
Before we leave
The nurse takes us aside
And she tells the two of us
To take care of each other
I'm not sure if I remember this right
But I think that's where we start to giggle
A relief in the grief
