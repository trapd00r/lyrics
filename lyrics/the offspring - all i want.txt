(Okay)
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya

Day after day your home life's a wreck
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect
You get no relief
You gotta speak up
And yell out your piece

So back off your rules
Back off your jive
Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone
Not asking a lot
I don't wanna to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want

Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya

How many times is it gonna take
Till someone around you hears what you say
You've tried being cool
You feel like a lie
You've played by their rules
Now it's their turn to try 

So back off your rules
Back off your jive
Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone
Not asking a lot
I just don't wanna to be controlled 

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want 

I said it before
I'll say it again
If you could just listen then it might make sense

So back off your rules
Back off your jive
Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone
Not asking a lot
Just don't wanna to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
