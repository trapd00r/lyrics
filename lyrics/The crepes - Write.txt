Ghost on the street today
Doorways of Jackson Square
In tinsel and tap shoes
Mardi Gras beads in her hair
Down to the graveyard
She wrung out her hands
As if he will meet her
All day she stands
So don't leave me
And I know you're justified

So don't leave me
Cause a part of you in me died
We wish ourselves beautiful
We cry in the night
And it's not the love you feared
But the fall from the height
My personal ledges
Afraid to look down
My crepe paper bridges
Enough water to drown

Chorus

And I see the lonely souls
Searchin'
But before the heartbreak rose
Draw the curtain
I'm a ghost on the streets today
Surrounded by eyes
I feel them peer through me
And my harlequin disguise
If it makes you feel better
Come join me the while
And there's love in these open arms
Some love in my spirits' smiles

Chorus
