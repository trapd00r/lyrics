Back to the old days damn it's been a while
Since I took a my first glance at that beautiful
Smile on that very first day baby I always knew
That once special day I'd be married to you
Put a smile on my face when my day was
Blue in other words girl you were my dreams
Come true so when I really think about it

Hours at a time around 3 o clock
Day that you would come home
From school I'd be sitting in the porch
Straight waiting for you spent as much
Time with you until you parents came
Home when I got back to my house I'd call
You on the phone sometimes it makes me
Sad when I think about the past it's a trip
How them times had to go so fast now we made
This love turn into a bond what were going through
Now will make it more strong so ill fix my mistakes
And take it day to day ask god to help me when I lay
Down and pray you're the only person in this world
I could turn to when everyone is fake you're the one that
Stays true so I'll love you to the fullest and there ain't
No doubt about it and I'll say it one more time baby doll

To think of living life without you really
Makes me nuts so I'll thank god daily
