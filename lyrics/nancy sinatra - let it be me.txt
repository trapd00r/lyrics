If for each bit of gladness
Someone must taste the sadness
I'll bare the sorrow
Let it be me

No matter what the price is
I'll make the sacrifices
Through each tomorrow
Let it be me

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me

I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me

Si tu me condamne
Je t'aime, mon amour
Au court des flambers
Je n'ai peur rien

Je t'appartien
Let it be me
