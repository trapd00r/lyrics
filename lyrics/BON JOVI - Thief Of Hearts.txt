You can lock up all the doors
Pull up the covers
Turn out the lights
I'll know where you are
It's all right

You can go ahead and hide
You know youcan't keep me out
I'll find my way
I'm here to stay
Even the cops can't save you now

Hey baby There's nothing you can do
Hey baby It isn't up to you

I am the thief of hearts
Don't hide or try to run
I'll play the part. I'm the thief of hearts
I've come to steal your love

You can hold on to your heart
You ain't gonna win
Go ahead and draw the blinds
I'm still coming in

Hey baby I'm gonna wear you down
Hey baby Better listen to me now

I'm the thief of hearts
The shadow on your wall
A whisper in your ear
A footstep in the hall

I'm the thief of hearts
Don't hide or try to run
I'll play the part, I'm the thief of hearts
I'm gonna steal your love

Hey, baby There's nothing you can do
Hey, baby You know there ain't no use

I am the thief of hearts
Guilty of the charge
You can throw away the keys
And double up the bars

I am the thief of hearts
Don't hide or try to run
I'll play the part, I'm the thief of hearts
I'm gonna steal your love.
