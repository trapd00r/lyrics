I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
One night is what I want baby
And I'll show you paradise
I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
I'll do whatever it takes to
To show you paradise

I'd love to see, you get closer to me
And now believe, don't let anyone get between
You set me free/set me free/ in a way that I can't describe
How will I know, when you don't stand next to me
ooh let me have you

I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
One night is what I want baby
And I'll show you paradise
I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
I'll do whatever it takes to
To show you paradise

I want to say, oh I just loved to be with you
All I can pray for, is a power to keep you here with me
Day after day/day after day/ I wanted to call out your name
And when you called me, you made my dreams come true
ooooooh let me have you

I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
One night is what I want baby
And I'll show you paradise
I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
I'll do whatever it takes to
To show you paradise

I tried to let go, and walk away, don't fall in love again
I don't have to prove oh baby I'm a fool
Day after day/day after day/ I wanted to call out your name
How will I know, I just got to show you paradise
I gota I gota show you 
ohhh I just gota show you baby

I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
One night is what I want baby
And I'll show you paradise
I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
I'll do whatever it takes to
To show you paradise
I'll bring you all my love
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
One night is what I want baby
And I'll show you paradise
I'll bring you all my love
And I'll show you paradise
I'll bring you all my love
And I'll show you paradise
