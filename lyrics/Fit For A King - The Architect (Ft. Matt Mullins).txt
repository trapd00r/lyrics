I sat here watching it all unfold
And it kills me to have seen us lose control

Turn the clocks back
Am I the only one that's changed?
I know we've got it in ourselves to turn this around
Turn the clocks back
I know that we can change
I know we must change

I will return, and I will rebuild
I will return, and I will rebuild
I will return, and I will rebuild
I will return, and I will rebuild

I've been sent away
To find myself in the darkness
Don't tell me that I can wait
We must find ourselves tonight
We must find ourselves tonight

I will rebuild

I will rebuild this faith from the ground up
Mark my words, I will rebuild
I will rebuild this faith from the ground up
Mark my words, I will rebuild

Turn the clocks back
Am I the only one that's changed?
I know we've got it in ourselves to turn this around
Turn the clocks back
Return to the beginning and start again

All I leave in my path is destruction
Hell has opened its gates for me
Crooked is the path that I lead
Telling myself I can make it and that I'm not in over my head
The fire has come to consume me
I will rebuild

Created in beauty
And molded by corruption
I am pathetic

I've been sent away
To find myself in the darkness
Don't tell me that I can wait
We must find ourselves tonight
We must find ourselves tonight
