I cover me up I colour me white
White as if it's over
Over night
A new page
I need a new beginning

I colour me up I colour me red
But then my mother said
I won't waste another child
Under red lights

I cover me up I colour me good
But we're never good enough
Who taught us to compete
Is life a competition?

I know I'm 2 part many
And I change my mind daily
Many things I can't explain
But I know that this ain't the right way But I know this!
Maybe I should colour me gold
'cause gold is forever gold

What if we don't go to work today
Let's see how we play
Let's see how society would work
Without all the people who go to work
Whom nobody knows of
Let's see how that goes
What if we don't go to work today
Let's see how we play
Without a teacher in the way
Without a friend to hold my hand
Without the drummer in my band
Without the power to control
The only life we can afford
I know I'm 2 part many
And I change my mind daily
But I know this, I know this
