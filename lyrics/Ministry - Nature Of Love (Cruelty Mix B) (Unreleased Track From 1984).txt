Go!

Love...

Hey!

Love

Love is like an open hand
Stings a little when it lands

Hold me closer, hold me tighter
Hold me so damn close that my heart's on fire
It's a fantasy, it's a nightmare
And the whole damn world is walking round in theirs

I said love

Love is like a razor blade
Double edge and double pain

Hold me closer, hold me tighter
When I rip your flesh and the pain is fresh
It's a fantasy, it's a nightmare
And the whole damn world doesn't seem to care

I said love

Love...

Love is like a butcher knife
Double sharp for single lives

Hold me closer, hold me tighter
As the lights go out and we start to shout
It's a fantasy, it's a nightmare
With a big black bruise and a handful of hair

I said love

Love...

I'm not finished yet!

Love...
