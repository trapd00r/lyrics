I was carried on a wolf's back
Here to corrupt humanity
I will pommel it with opulence
With corpulence and greed

In God you trust
My mummy dust (dust)
My mummy dust

Your cavalier of crapulence
To this feast of rapacity
I will bury you in treasures
Just to feed your incapacity

In God you trust
My mummy dust (dust)
My mummy dust

In God you trust
My mummy dust (dust)
My mummy dust

You are the possess√©e of avarice
I am the ruler of the earth
I will smother you in riches
Until you choke in sordid mirth

You are summoned in cupidity
Purulence and lust
I am the magnet for stupidity
Divine you feel my thrust

In God you trust
My mummy dust (dust)
My mummy dust

In God you trust
My mummy dust (dust)
In God we trust
My mummy dust
In God we trust
My mummy dust
In God we trust
My mummy dust
