I know you have no place left to go
I'm your last escape
So I've been told
You get paranoid
Drinking on your own

I've been replaced by you before
I'm just another corpse along your road
No regretful eyes
Can win my sympathy this time

Halo, halo
Above your head today
Saying you're a changed man now

Halo, halo
Above your head today
Feels like sand in my eye

Giving every promise bitter ends
Disappointment walks with you my friend
And I am not the only one you hurt
A dozen times or more
Regretful eyes can't win my sympathy this time

Halo, halo
Above your head today
Saying you're a changed man now

Halo, halo
Above your head today
Feels like sand in my eye
