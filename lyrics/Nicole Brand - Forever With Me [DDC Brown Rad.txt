Together
Together
Together

Stay, don't go away
Dance with me again
Clap your hands
This rhythm inside of me

I said yeah oh, ye-yeah oh
Don't stop to sing and dance with me
I said yeah oh, ye-yeah oh
Don't stop, fly and scream with me

Together
Forever with me
Together
Forever with me
Together

To... to... together...
To... to... together...
To... to... together...

Hear me
This night
Follow me
And believe you will feel all right

I said yeah oh, ye-yeah oh
Don't stop to sing and dance with me
I said yeah oh, ye-yeah oh
Don't stop, fly and scream with me

To... to... together
Forever with me
Together
Forever with me
Together

To... to... together

To... to... together
