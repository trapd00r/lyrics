There was a time, looking through myself,
Wanting to pretend
If I escaped, I could fill myself.
I don't think you can.
Been far and wide, but that hole inside
Never really leaves.
I went away, what I really left,
Left behind was me!

It's telling me
To be on my way... home!

Million miles away!
A million miles away!
I can't stay,
I can't stay
A million miles away!

Each passing day, every passing face
Seems like such a blur.
I long to be
Home, silently
Lying next to her.
Just to get back by her side is all,
All I need to be.
I went away
But what I really left,
Left behind was me!

I need to be
Getting on my way... home!

Million miles away!
A million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
A million miles away!

It's telling me
To be on my way... home!

I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
I can't take,
I can't take
Million miles away!
