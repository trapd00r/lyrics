Petit poulet
Tout c'est okay
Maintenant bebe tout c'est okay
The life you left behind won't find you
The love you kept inside will come
And even when your own heart blinds you
Nothing undoes the work you've done

The sun's still in the sky
The moon is there at night
The ground is still underfoot
And still holds you

Petit poulet (Little chicken)
Tout ca c'est OK (everything is all right)
Maintenant bebe (now baby)
Tout ca c'est OK (everything is all right)

There isn't any answer to the question
You only learn to live with it
There isn't any answer in religion
Don't believe one who says there is

But... The voices are heard
Off all who cry
I am around you as long in the night
Kissing your plight
Baby child
Kissing your plight
Kissing your plight

I am the sun up in the sky
I am the moon also at night
I am the ground under your foot
I am holding you

Petit poulet (Little chicken)
Tout ca c'est OK (everything is all right)
Maintenant bebe (now baby)
Tout ca c'est OK (everything is all right
