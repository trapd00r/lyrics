I will forgive but I won't forget
And I hope you know
You've lost my respect

You better watch out
If you don't know what's going on around you
You better think twice
Before you fly off the handle and lose it
You better join us
Before you get lost in the shuffle
You gotta rise against
The demons that are gonna try and hold you down

Does it run in your blood
To betray the ones you love? [x2]

The ones you love - x3

'Cause I'm not a pawn
For you to play in your fucking game
I've got dignity
And a dream that I want to achieve
Under pressure
You crumbled and you let me down
And I'm not deaf
And all I hear are your empty promises

Does it run in your blood
To betray the ones you love? [x4]

(Blood!)
The ones you love [x3]

Does it run in your blood
To betray the ones you love?
Yes it runs in your blood
To betray the ones you love
Yes it runs in your blood
To betray the ones you love
Yes it runs in your blood
To betray the ones you love
Yes it runs in your blood
To betray the ones you love

I will forgive but I won't forget
And I hope you know
You've lost my respect

Yes it runs in your blood
To betray the ones you love! [x2]
