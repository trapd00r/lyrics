Blinded Eyes

[M: Groth, L: Persson]

I've been convicted, for something that I have not done
There is no meaning, this whole scenario is unreal
Sometimes it's hard to read the signs
And see what is good, and what is not
Fear of the unknown, ignore what is real

All the signs of witchery have been given to you
Blinded eyes, so you can't see what is reality

Avoiding answers for the questions that I seek
A given answer from those who say that they believe
Sometimes it's hard to read the signs
And see what is good, and what is not
Fear of the unknown, ignore what is real

All the signs of witchery have been given to you
Blinded eyes, so you can't see what is reality

[Solo: Per / Jacob]

No sense of pledging, cuase the decision has been made
I shall await the sentence, that is soon to end my life

All the signs of witchery have been given to you
Blinded eyes, so you can't see what is reality
