Leap on down into the trees
Brush against the glowing leaves
Islands floating in the sky
With sails like moons leading me
All of this happened so fast
To feel your breath knocked out of me
Islands floating in the street
The street will lead us to the sea

-Get over you-

I try to carry my sweet love with me
But oh! his mind is making food for worms
And only he remembers the sweet parts of me
They're the ones I can't recall
