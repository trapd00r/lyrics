I can't believe we've come to this 
No one cares to tell 
Right from wrong 
Cause it feels like we're 
On a fast train run 
Speeding far away from home 
Some things should be paid to see 
But it doesn't make much sense at all 
Cause no matter how we twist it 
How we turn it around 
We're still wondering 
What's going on 

Oh ain't life just crazy 
Everyone keeps saying 
Nothing's Wrong 

Chorus 

I'm no ordinary girl 
Caught up in the middle 
Of the class crowd 
Cause I don't know how 
To behave and be good 
I'm just a little out of line 
Trying to make a long in 
A cynical world 
But I don't know how 
To pretend I'm an ordinary girl 

We're strangers when we look inside 
No one dares to tell you how they feel 
God I wish that we cold find 
A way to put trust back into the world 

Oh ain't life just crazy 
Everyone keeps saying 
Nothing's wrong 

Chorus 

I'm starting at the subway sorrows 
Imagining how it could be 
No we can't even look at each other 
And feel a little harmony 

Chorus
