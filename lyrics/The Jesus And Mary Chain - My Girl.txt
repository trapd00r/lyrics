I got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (my girl)
Talking 'bout (my girl) my girl

I've got so much honey the bees they envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'll say
What could make me feel this way
My girl (my girl)
I'm talking 'bout (my girl) my girl

A hey, hey, hey
A hey, hey, hey

I don't need no money that * ? *
I've got all the riches one man could take

I guess you'll say
What could make me feel this way
My girl (my girl)
I'm talking 'bout (my girl) my girl

I got sunshine on a cloudy day
I even got the month of May, hey
I got, I got what she
A hey hey hey
Talking 'bout my girl
