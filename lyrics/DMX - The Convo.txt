You tell me that there's love here. 
But to me it's blatant. 
Nothin' but all the blood here. 
I'm dealin with Satan. 
Plus with all the hatin' 
it's hard to keep peace. (uh huh) 
Thou shall not steal, 
but I will to eat. 
I tried doin' good, but 
good's not too good for me. 
Misunderstood, 
why you chose the hood for me. 
Me I'm aiight, 
I just had to work hard at it. 
Went to grama for answers, 
she told me that god had it. 
So now here I am, 
confused and full of questions. 
Am I born to lose, 
or is this just a lesson. 
And who it's goin' choose 
when it gets turned around. 
And will it be 
layin' in my own blood 
and on the ground. 

My child, 
I've watched you grow up 
and I've been there. (uh huh) 
Even at those times 
you least suspected it 
I was there. 
And look at what I've given you 
a talent to rhyme. 
I may not come when you call, 
but I'm always on time. 

Somebody's knockin'. 
Should I let em in. 
Lord we're just startin, 
but where will it end. 
Somebody's knockin'. 
Should I let em in. 
Lord we're just startin, 
but where will it end. 
But when the funds are low 
the guns'll blow. 
Lookin' for that one that owe, 
make em run that dough. 

No! 
Put down the guns 
and write a new rhyme. 
You'll get it all in due time. 
You'll do fine. 
Just have faith 
cuz you mine. (uh huh) 
And when you shine 
it's goin' be a sight to behold. 
So don't fight to be old, 
or lose sight when it's cold. 
See that light down the road, 
it's goin' guide you there 
Two sets of footprints, 
I was right beside you there. 

But what about them times I 
only saw one. 
Those were the times that I was 
under the gun, 

It was then I carried you my son. 
Led you to safety. 
It just wasn't your time to face me. (uh huh) 

Ayo a few of them times I thought you would erase me. 
But all you did was embrace me. 
Prepared me for the worst. 
Offered me eternal light, 
and scared me with the hearse. 
And the curse 
turned to grace. 
When the hurt 
turned to faith. 
No more runnin', (uh huh) 
and slidin' in the dirt 
cuz I'm safe. 

Somebody's knockin'. 
Should I let em in. 
Lord we're just startin, 
but where will it end. 
Somebody's knockin'. 
Should I let em in. 

So if I'm yo' man 
I'm in yo' hand. 
Wus yo' plan. 
Never had a friend 
cuz you couldn't trust your man. 
Learned to stand before I crawled. 
Things were twisted! 
And if you showed me anything at all 
then I missed it. 
Looked the wrong way. (uh huh) 
I've done some wrong things. (true) 
Kept a bad attitude, 
but that's what wrong brings. 
And now you mean to tell me that 
after all this time, 
it was you that kept the dog from goin' out of his mind. 
It was you that breathed life 
into my lungs when I was born. 
And it was you that let me know 
what was right, 
from what was wrong. 
And it was you that let me do 
what I knew what could be done. 
And it was you that gave me a good wife 
and a beautiful son. 
And It's been you speakin' to me 
inside my mind. 
And it's been you who has forgiven 
time after time. 
It was you who opened my eyes 
so I could see. 
And it was you who shined yo' 
light on me.
