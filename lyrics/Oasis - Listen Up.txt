Listen up, what's the time said today?
I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I wanna see my crime
Day by day there's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think and the words
They won't let you say

One fine day
Gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad
If I had more time

Sailing down the river alone
I'll be trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic, life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own

But I don't believe in magic, life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own

Sailing down the river alone
I'll be trying to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic 'cause life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
