When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changin' world in which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya?
When ya got a job to do, ya got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changin' world in which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
