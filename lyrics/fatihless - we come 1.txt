All the subtle flavors of
My life have become
Bitter seeds and
Poisoned leaves without you
You represent what's true
I drain the color from the sky
And turn blue without you
These arms like a purpose
Flapping like a humming bird
I'm nervous cuts
I'm the left eye
You're the right
Would it not be
Madness to fight?
We come one

In you the song
Which rights my wrongs
In you the fullness of living
The power to begin again
From right now
In you, in you, in you

We come one
We come one
We come one

I'm unafraid
Never never scared
You always watched
Pressed air
I'm the left eye
You're the right
Would it not be
Madness to fight?

We come one
We come one
