I've come a long way
And I thought it was possible to love someone new
To forget about you

I've come a long way
And I thought it was possible
To love someone new
I'm stronger than you

Mary, Mary - can't get you out of my head
Mary, Mary - I won't forget what you said
Mary, Mary - can't get you out of my head

We play a new game
Can you feel it racing through my veins straight to you?
So shallow and blue

This is a good day and you're an acquired taste
That I learnt to brew now I got to have you

Mary, Mary - can't get you out of my head
Mary, Mary - I won't forget what you said
Mary, Mary - can't get you out of my head

Love me sister friend, love me until the end

You are all that I've got
I won't forget what you said
You are all that I'm not
Can't get you out of my head
You are all that I've got

Mary, Mary - can't get you out of my head
Mary, Mary - I won't forget what you said
Mary, Mary - can't get you out of my head

Mary, I need you to say (You are all that I've got)
Mary, my love we're the same (You are all that I've got)
Mary, I wan't you to stay (You are all that I've got)
Mary, my love we're the same
