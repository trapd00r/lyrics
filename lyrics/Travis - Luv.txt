What's so wrong? Why the face so long? Is it over?
And where you going that you no longer belong here?
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
Where have you been, Luv? When the mistake we made
Was in never having planned to fall to fall in love, Luv

Singing this song, singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so, in letting you go
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you

Singing this song, singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so, in letting you go
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you

So what's so wrong? Why the face so long? Are you changing?
And where you been to that you no longer remember?
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
Where have you been, Luv? When the mistake we made
Was in never having planned to fall to fall in love, Luv
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv, Luv
