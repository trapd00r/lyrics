You're my love, my dolce vita
With no doubt, the one I dream of
The movie scene, with James Dean
That's for sure
Life's too short to live without you
Rivers flow and time's so precious
Here we are, you and I
Let's grow older

You can tell me what to do
You can tell me what to say
Because of you I'm here today
You touch my soul
All my troubles blown away
In your arms I wanna stay
Come with me, come with me, come with me
I need you baby

I, I know, know that it could be
So great for you and me
I need you, I want you
I know, know that it could be
So great for you and me
Stay with me, stay with me

I remember when I met you
You said words, I won't forget them
I took a step, into your world
Oh, you're special
You were sweet and nice directly
With your eyes I felt connected
I believe it was that sign
That we belong together

You can tell me what to do
You can tell me what to say
Because of you I'm here today
You touch my soul
All my troubles blown away
In your arms I wanna stay
Come with me, come with me, come with me
I need you baby

I, I know, know that it could be
So great for you and me
I need you, I want you
I know, know that it could be
So great for you and me
Stay with me, stay with me

All my life I wanted you
Someone I could hold onto
Together with you I feel free
Like a bird in the sky, I surrender when you smile
In your arms I wanna stay
I need you baby, 'cause..

I, I know, know that it could be
So great for you and me
I need you, I want you
I know, know that it could be
So great for you and me
Stay with me, stay with me
