So many lonely people
Who only have themselves to blame
So many broken hearted
Who get a chance but throw it away

Out of my window I see a picture
It's a different view out of my window
Something so good is something that you hold in to
I'll never ever let a chance go by ...
So many wounded soldiers
Who still don't know the value of life
Their war is never over-
They never win or lose they just survive

Out of my window - I see a picture
It's a different view out of my window
Something so good is something that you hold on to

I'll never ever let a chance go by
L'll never ever let a chance go by

So many lonely people
Who only have themselves to blame
So stay with me you won't be sorry
There's nothing to lose everything to gain

Out of my window I see a picture
It's a different view out af my window
Something so good is something that you hold on to
Out of my window I see a future
Maybe that's the reason why

I'll never ever let a chance go by
I'll never ever let a chance go by
I'll never ever let a chance go by
I'll never ever let a chance go by
