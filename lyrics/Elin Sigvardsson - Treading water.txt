He's out there making shadows in the snow, 
Pretending he's a star. 
He's running around there now, trying to steal the show, 
But probably he'll never get that far

He's perfectly ordinary and he has made mistakes, 
But he claims it's all gonna end up his way. 
It's all gonna end up his way.

He's inside my head and I'm treading water.
Cause every time he catches a breath I'm feeling much smaller, 
Every time he shuffles a step I'm falling much harder. 

He's worst of them all maybe, but he plays a little foolish game with me 
And I swear it's all gonna and up his way.
Every restless hour is gonna end up his way.

He's inside my head and I'm treading water. 
Cause every time he catches a breath I'm feeling much smaller,
Every time he shuffles a step I'm falling much harder. 

Then him, then now, then him.
