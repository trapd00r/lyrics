I've been hurt by love
Too many times
Not to know the signs of breaking up
When they have been

Don't try to hurt me
Don't try to harm me
Don't try to hurt me
Or You pay

'Cause You know I get magic or bad
And when I get mad
You know I do things
I really shouldn't do

I've told You once before
And I'll tell You once again:
Don't try to hurt me, or You pay

I've told You first time - easy girl
But that was almost second time
But there won't be forgive

Don't try to hurt me
Don't try to harm me
Don't try to hurt me
Or You pay

'Cause You know I get magic or bad
And when I get mad
You know I do things
I really shouldn't do

I've told You once before
And I'll tell You once again:
Don't try to hurt me
Don't try to harm me
Don't try to hurt me
Or You pay
