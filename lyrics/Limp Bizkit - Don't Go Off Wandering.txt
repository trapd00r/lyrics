Everyday is nothing
But stress to me
I'm constantly dwellin'
On how you got
The best of me

Wanna know somethin'
I can't believe the way
You keep testin' me
And mentally molestin' me

Would you think any less of me
If I said that I'd be there
Would you think any less of me
If I said I really cared

Of course you would
'Cause you
Only want what you can't have
As for me
I'm stuck with my dick in my hand

Because you don't feel
Nothing at all

You don't feel
Nothing at all

Maybe there's more
To life then it seems
I'm constantly runnin'
From reality chasin' dreams

Wanna know somethin'
I can't believe
Just how much misery
Comes with humility

Do you think any less of me
Now that I'm gone
Look at me now
Everything is gone

I can't seem to do anything right
But I've figured out
Why you don't let me inside

Because you don't feel
Nothing at all

You don't feel
Nothing at all

You need nothin'
From me now
So you think
I'm useless to you now

But I need one thing
From you now
I insist that you
Feel me now

You said you needed me
You said, you said
You said you needed me
You said, you said

You said
You said

You said
You said

You don't feel
Nothing at all
You don't feel
Nothing at all
