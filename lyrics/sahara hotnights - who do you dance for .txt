Yeah I've been lookin' all over his place
For something missing or some little change
Thought I could see a sign in his face
Oh what a waste I can't help it

I think I'm falling out of his sight
The smiles around him are catching his eye
Confirm my suspicion I bet I am right
Oh what a waste I can't help it

Every night I wonder who do you dance for
Who's got your heart and who do you care for
(every night)
I'm only throwing it away
(every night)
I think I'm losing all the way

Yeah I've been sitting alone for so long
With a war in my head
Wondering where you have gone
Don't be surprised
I was never that strong
Oh not again I can't take it

One little victory is all I need
I'm tied to his arm but still I don't see
What it is that I got that brings him back to me
Oh not again I can't take it

Every night I wonder who do you dance for?
Who's got your heart I'm not taking a chance no no no
