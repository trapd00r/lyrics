(Ira Louvin/Charlie Louvin)

If I could only win your love
I'd make the most of everything
I'd proudly wear your wedding ring
My heart would never stray when you're away.

If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love.

Oh how can I ever say
How I crave your love when you're gone away
Oh how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight.

If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love.

Oh how can I ever say
How I crave your love when you're gone away
Oh how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight.

If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love...
