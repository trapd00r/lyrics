So, all of you Africans, all of you Africans that wanna do thangs that's workin' for other people, y'all need to open your own business
Save your money
Quit payin' motherfuckers for jheri curls
Quit payin' motherfuckers for perms
Save your money, start your own business, and you true Africans, will have put hundreds to work
This is our future right here, this out future right here
(This some shit
The new generation is on
The new generation)
Hey, I'mma tell you right now, if-if if I have to die today, for this little African right here, to have a future I'm a dead motherfucker (You right)

Snoop Dogg:
Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs
Gettin' a rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with yo' shank 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots ta handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time

Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway:
Them say me grow up to be nothin', look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am, it's only me
(Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?)

Dr. Dre:
Now, I'm holdin' a dub, sitting on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, off on parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I'll be making as soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatchu wanna do
Didn't know he had a .22
Straight sitting behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands, I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (For what?)
For trying to jack them little homies for they grip

Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway:
Me learn many things from what me on the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
(Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets
Whatchu gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?)

Snoop Dogg:
Something for the real OG's to get with
Some facts, made our made, now you wanna run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enuff to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's but they serve down
In a G ride, east side where they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county with nothing but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip

Daz Dillinger and Donny Hathaway:
Now me finally grown as you can see, still an OG
For life and always remain to be
(Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?)
