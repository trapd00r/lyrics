Straight away I learned to pray
He preys upon the sky
You go to heaven when you die
But keep that lake of fire in mind

Broke all the rules at Catholic school
Turned to a life of crime
When I stole that motorbike
I left a trail of tears behind

Had casual sex, smoked cigarettes
Threw caution to the wind
Was a winding path that I always plan
To get back to you again

Till the ground 'neath under clouds
The rain follows the plow
But it was never as profound
As I had wanted it to be

The birds, they sang the rites of spring
In summer's La-Z-Boy
I sat down to enjoy a world
That's comfortable in green

A red feather hawk and a Celtic cross
Are pierced into my ear
No matter where I went I meant
To make my way back here

Well, I don't need God or common law
To tell me right from wrong
'Cause when you press me to your chest
I know where I belong
