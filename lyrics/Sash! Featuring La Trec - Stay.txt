I had a dream last night
You were there
You held my hand so tight
I thought I'd just die
Do you remember
When we use to have so much fun
I used to cry sometimes
Those days are gone
Do you remember?

I wanna go back to
Back to the days
When I needed
A little more fun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay!

Come on and stay
Stay
Stay

Turning back time to
Times we made love
All day
Under the sun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay!

Come on and stay
Stay
Stay

I had a dream last night...
