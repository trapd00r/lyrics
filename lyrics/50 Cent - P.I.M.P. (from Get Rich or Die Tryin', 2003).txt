Get Rich or Die tryin'

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

Now shorty she in da club, she's dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She's feeding fools fantasies they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later had her ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in they ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform while she in the bed
Bitches that try catch a date and come and play the kid
Look baby this is simple you can't see, you fucking with me you fucking with a P-I-M-P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

I'm by my money you see, girl you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair bitch I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne, and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you need some one, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I could solve them, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't about shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

Shorty I told you fools before, I stay with the twos
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a hoe till I got a bitch confused
She got on payless, me I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for Chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this ho, you could have her when I'm done I ain't gonna keep her
Man bitches come and go, every nigga and pimp they know
They say mystique but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch tutor me how you strippin in the street
Put my other hoes down you get your ass beat
Now lick my bottom bitch, you always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe outta pocket I put a charge on the bitch
'Cause I need 4 TVs and they Mgs for a 6
Hoe make the pimp rich, I ain't payin' bitch
Catch a dick, such a dick shit... trick

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
