Now get on up and do this dance
Move your body feel the trance
Feel the basses are clappin' snappin'
Take a race for me and hear me rappin'
I wanna take ya I wanna make ya
I wanna get this beat to shake ya
Burn the house down  make some noise
Feel the rhythm you've got no choice
I want your body can you feel it
I want your body oh my baby oh my baby
I want your body can you feel it
I want your body oh my baby oh my baby
It's showtime get up and get crazy
Land the dancefloor don't be lazy
The beat is pumping  the crowd is jumping
The all  our  humping is what you want
And you know that the beat get your life for free
But if you don't make sure that you get a receive
Like one two let's get on the move
Back on the track and end with the groove
I want your body can you feel it
I want your body oh my baby oh my baby
I want your body can you feel it
I want your body oh my baby oh my baby
Now get on up and do this dance
Move your body feel the trance
