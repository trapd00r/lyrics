I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun

I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun

I'm a loser, that is a fact for sure
I am happy even if you don't want
To invite me out for a dance tonight
I'm not normal, I know it, I don't care

I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun

I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun

I'm always here like a sun
I'm always here

Like a ghost I follow your steps so true
You don't have to bribe me or fill me up
Give me just a minute to shine with you
I can make you so happy, make you laugh

I am never gonna say I'm sorry
For the essence of my soul
There's so many ways to change my life
'Cause I want to, woah-oh
I'm like a clown, I have fun for everyone
I'm like a clown, I have fun for everyone
I'm like a clown, I have fun for everyone
I'm like a clown, I have fun for everyone

I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here like a sun

I'm never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
I'm never gonna let you down
I'm always here

I am never gonna say I'm sorry
I'm a clown for everyone
