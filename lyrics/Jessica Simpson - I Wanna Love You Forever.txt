You set my soul at ease
Chased darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too
I know you do
I've got so much more to give
this can't die, I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me
and I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

Chorus
I wanna love you forever
and this is all I'm asking of you
ten thousand lifetimes together
is that so much for you to do?
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
and felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew.
I'm gonna to love you forever.

My mind fails to understand
what my heart tells me to do
and I'd give up all I have just to be with you
and now I do
I've always been taught to win
and I never thought I'd fall
be at the mercy of a man
I've never been
now I only want to be right where you are.

Chorus

In my life I learned that heaven never waits, noooo
let's take this now before its gone like yesterday
'Cause when I'm with you
there's no where else that I would ever wanna be, no
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you lovin me

Chorus

Forever (ooh)
I wanna love you forever
Everyday, everyday
