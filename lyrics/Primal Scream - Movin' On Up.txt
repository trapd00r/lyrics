I was blind, now I can see, you made a believer out of me
I was blind, now I can see, you made a believer out of me

I'm moving on up now, getting out of the darkness
My light shines on, my light shines on, my light shines on

I was lost, now I'm found, I believe in you, I've got no bounds
I was lost, now I'm found, I believe in you, I got no bounds

I'm moving on up now, getting out of the darkness
My light shines on, my light shines on, my light shines on
(My light shines on) my light shines on
(My light shines on) my light shines on

My light shines on, my light shines on
My light shines on, my light shines on
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
I'm getting outta darkness, my light shines on (my light shines on)
