You're caught in a lie
Living someone else's dream
No one takes you that seriously
Well I can relate
The story's writing me
But the facts are false
What good does truth bring?

Is this what you want?
Is this who you want me to be?
I'll take a shot of whatever you've got
But it's not going down that easily
