No way to compromise
I'm giving you the message
I really don't futurize
We're entering the space age
It's time to wake you up
Before you find it's too late
Can't you see you're in a trap
Why don't you free the pressure?
It's about time - Let us try
To find another place
Where we could live much better
Together we'll win the race
As now the world's a failure
Please take a look around
See what they've done to the earth
Nothing but dying crowds
But there's a chance of rebirth
Space is wide - Let us fly
Run to the stars
See the sky wide-open
Run to the stars
Who knows what will happen?
Run to the stars
Starting mass mutation
Run to the stars
New civilization
Million miles beyond the cosmic darkened seas

We've made it to the sky
Travellin' trough emptiness
Meteorites passing by
Automotion careless
Leaving lightyears behind
Always going further
Wondering what we'll find
Is there any border?
Endless night - Endless flight
Run to the stars
See the sky wide-open
Run to the stars
Who knows what will happen?
Run to the stars
Starting mass mutation
Run to the stars
New civilization
Million miles beyond the cosmic darkened seas
