We'll dress your guts up
Convince you to stay
At first we'll rush
But that's 'cause we're both afraid
Forget about trust
We'LL toughen you up
You've got the right stuff.

You're rolling with the guys... NOW.

You chewed on the crust,
That's soaked in your gut
We'll stress your guts up

You're rolling with the guys... NOW.
You're rolling with the guys... NOW.
