[Drake]
I am on a 24 hour champagne diet
Spillin while i’m sippin it
Encourage you to try it
I’m probably just saying that cause i dont have to buy it
The club owner supply it
Boy i’m on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don’t want me to be
Guess what i made it
I’m the muthaf-cking man
I just want you to see come take a look
Get a load of this n-gga
Quit frontin on me
Don’t come around and try come gas me up
I like runnin on E
I, I, I,
Im on my Disney shit goofy flow
On records i’m captain hook and my new car is roofio
Damn
Where my roof just go
Im somebody that you should know
Get to shakin somethin cus thats what Drumma produced it for
Yes i make mistakes that i don’t ever make excuses for
Like even girls that love me and Constantly seducing hoes
I’m losing my thoughts i say damn
Where my roof go?
Top slipped off like Janet at the super bowl,
I got em

[Chorus]
they can’t help it, and I can’t blame ‘em
Since I got famous but b-tch, I got money to blow
Im gettin it in, letting these bills fall
All over your skin
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh

[Birdman]
Richer than the richest
We certified gettin it CM YM Cash Money business
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird hit the gucci store
And later get served
We smoked out with no roof on it
Them people passin so we smash on them
Ballin out we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider
No lie i’m higher than i ever been
Born rich born uptown born to win
Fully loaded automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint foreign lights with my b-tch in
Born hustlin too big n-gga to strive me up
Cant stop me more money burn em up

[Chorus]

[Weezy]
When I get paid every 24 hours money and the power
Come to VIP and get a Champagne Shower
I don’t have to worry because everything ours,
and I got a big bouquet of Mary Janes Flowers
That kush I promise Thats My Dude
But we don’t smoke that Reggie Bush
And I’m with two women make you take a second look
We poppin like Champagne Bottles But We Never Shook
and We Goin Be Alright If We Put Drake On Every Hook

[Chorus]
