She's a 5 foot 10 in catsuit
and bambi eyes,
Everybody who's staring wouldn't
believe that this girl was mine

I should have known I was wrong
When I left her for a life in pity but
they say you never miss
the water until it's gone (yeah)

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that

She's all dressed up for glamour and
rock and roll
Wanna squeeze her real tight
Get out of this place
If only I could take control

But she's out of my reach forever
And just a week ago she lied
next to me
It's so ironic how I had to lose
Just to see
That I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

(Chorus)

I don't wanna forget you
I don't even wanna try
How am I supposed to walk on by
When you're looking like that

How am I supposed to leave you(when you're looking like that)
I can't believe what I just gave away(oh no, no)
'Cause I can't take it back, I'm lost
I don't wanna live my life without you(live my life without you)
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that

(Chorus)
