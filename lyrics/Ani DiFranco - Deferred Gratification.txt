Deferred gratification
You are my new best friend
I got kids and so do my friends
It'll never be our world again

But look how weary the chief
It'll be a relief
To someday hear her say
Get it yourself
Get it yourself

Frozen soldier mannequin
In the back of the wax museum
Weekdays it's only 5 bucks to get in
See him fighting a battle he'll never win

And look how weary the chief
It'll be a relief
To someday hear him say
Get it yourself
Get it yourself

Deferred gratification
You are my new best friend
I vote in every election
Hope someday these kids
Are gonna help us win

And look how weary the chief
It'll be a relief
To someday hear him say
Get it yourself
Get it yourself
