Hey Mom, why didn't you tell me? 
Why didn't you teach me a thing or two? 
You just let me go, out into the world, 
You never thought to share what you knew. 

(Chorus): 
So I walked under a bus, 
I got hit by a train, 
Keep fallin' in love, 
Which is kind of the same, 
I've sunk out at sea, crashed my car, gone insane, 
And it felt so good, I wanna do it again. 

Hey Mom, why didn't you warn me? 


'Cause about boys there's something I should have known, 
They're like chocolate cake, like cigarettes, 
I know they're bad for me but I just can't leave 'em alone. 

(Repeat Chorus) 

Hey Mom, since we're talkin', 
What was it like when you were young? 
Has the world changed or is still the same? 
A man can kill and still be the sweetest fun. 

(Repeat Chorus)
