I only knew you for a little while
Did we run out of reasons
Did we run out of time
I told you my truths
Things we bury and hide
It came easy with you
I put the rest aside

You were offering more than I could ask for
That night
You were holding me up when I was on my way down
But as well as I knew I never realised
When it gets to you I can't straighten it out

Hey are you still hanging out
It's late did your spinning head carried away
Come on who were you thinking about
I was up and awaiting still you wanted to stay
Now your hand is still holding mine
But your eyes look far away

I found my thrills and I got my kicks quick
Stop me from using the cheapest of tricks
I was too nervous to walk a straight line
The biggest of failures
Can't believe that I tried

Stripped of my senses
I don't hear I don't see
Can't smell the trouble
Coming right back at me
If you look right through me
I'm sure you would see
I'm always haunted by my childish ideas

No explanation you haven't heard before
Bad excuses a thousand times or more
And there was I with my pathetic defence
Oh how useful to sometimes
Slip into somebody else

Hey are you still hanging out
It's late did your spinning head carried away
Come on who were you thinking about
I was up and awaiting still you wanted to stay
Now your hand is still holding mine
But your eyes look far away
