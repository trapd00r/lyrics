I wish
I wish
But it's all in vain
But it's all in vain

I wish
I wish
But it's all in vain
But it's all in vain

I wish
I wish
But it's all in vain
But it's all in vain

Different colours, different faces
Different schools in different places
Scour the morning papers, all in vain

Evening after, who remembers?
Say your prayers for the great pretenders
I see nothing but flowers, all in vain

I wish
I wish
But it's all in vain
But it's all in vain

I wish
I wish
But it's all in vain
But it's all in vain

All the gravestone elegies
I-never-met-you memories
And every TV picture, all in vain

All your questions, deep as skin
Seperate worlds to put them in
Another might-have-been, all in vain

I wish (colour blind as tse-tse flies)
I wish (sucking all our difference dry)
I wish (and as we sleep they multiply)
I wish
I wish (and as we sleep they multiply)
I wish
All in vain
I wish (and as we sleep they multiply)
I wish
All in vain
I wish (and as we sleep they multiply)
Multiply
