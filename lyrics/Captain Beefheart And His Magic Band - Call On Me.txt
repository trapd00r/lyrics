Call on me whenever you're in your lonely blue
In my house whenever you ever need me to call on you
At any time baby that you need love
And a little of that understanding too
Feel free love, call on me love 'cause I'm gonna call on you

I'll be there most any, most any time of day, call on me
To see you baby in the same old loving way, call on me
And if in the night you call and I'm away
Leave a little note baby, I'll be there when you say
Whoo, call on me

I'm so lonely, love, when you're away, call on me
And if I should ever, I should ever call on you, I want you to call on me always
I hope your love will always be so true
You call on me babe and I'm gonna surely call on you and uh
You call on me babe and I'm gonna call on you

Call on me baby, ooh come on baby
Come on baby, come baby
Don't you know I'm down on my knees?
Baby baby please
Call on me, call on me
