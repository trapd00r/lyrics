(Music:Magnusson / Lyrics:Jarrebring)

Darkness is fading
The mystic dawn is near
Our horde is ready
The final war is here

Armed to the teeth
Battleaxes and swords
Crossbows and spears
Armed to the teeth

Nothing has changed for a thousand years
But now the final moment is hear
Within the deepest holes of the abyss
New swords are made for our warrior host

Morning has broken
Blood will be spilled
Fire and destruction
It will be the end

We lighten our tourches
And turn towards heaven
We pray for a sign
A sign for war
