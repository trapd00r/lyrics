Do you know the sad fact of a victim
Their life is wasted for our life
How is this comfortable system
We just overlook something

It may have been a mistake
It may have been necessary
There may have been difficulties
Now the time that we express gratitude to everything
Oh please pray heartily to the soul

風の中で　消えゆく願い
すぐ傍にある声に
気づかず　笑いあって
失われてく　儚き願い
いつか思い出したい
あの日の温もりを

Do you know the sad fact of abuse
Their life is wasted for our life
How was the experiment done
We just overlook something

It may have been a mistake
It may have been necessary
There may have been difficulties
Now the time that we express gratitude to everything
Oh please pray heartily to the soul

風の中で　凍える命
置き去りにされた夢
静かに目を閉じる
冷たい雨に　怯える命
いつか思い出したい
あの日の温もりを

風の中で　凍える光
彼方の星明りに　この手を差し伸べて
信じるままに　捧げる祈り
いつか思い出したい
未来へ続く道

Stardust is falling down to the ground
We found small light in the wind
We raise our hands for the starlight
We pray with reverence
Stardust is falling down to the ground
We found small light in the wind
We raise our hands for the starlight
We found small light in the wind
We raise our hands for the starlight
