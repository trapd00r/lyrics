They say that your kiss is like a pill
Designed to change the way that I feel
For every heartache you gotta cure
That's why I put my trust in you

Everybody's looking for what they want
And everybody's looking for what they need
Gotta keep on looking for what I want
Gotta keep on looking for what I want

But I don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame

Don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame

A Medicine
Running through my veins

But I don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame

Don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame

Trapped in emotions, you've got me hooked
The cure that you give is not in the book
To you I'm addicted, I can't deny
To shake you off, I won't even try

Don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
Running through my veins

But I don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame

I don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
Running through my veins

But I don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame
