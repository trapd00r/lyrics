(This is, this is one of those songs that you can sort of clap along too)

Hides the eyes beneath the bill of the cap
Walks amoungst the flies that hover over the mat
He lies, but only when there's a reason
Mentions life by the tragedy, the comedy, the season

Poor at handling and managing income
Got enough love to pass around and then some
Been done, that there a name you can trust
Read the whole matchbook and put a flame to the brush

Good with packs and rips up sacks
Put the show in biz, try to give what you get
When you let him run free with the thought
Pull the line in, try to see what you caught

I ain't all that bad, but I ain't all that great
Went back to the lab and began to mutate
Wait, I still look the same, still got the same dumb name
Ain't a damn thing changed

But if you like surprises, I know of a party
Where they all dance around to your heartbeat
Bring your own agenda and embrace your flaws
Let's put a face on this common cause

And he said, some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, well right on

Stay gold Pony Boy, stay true outspoken
Make a record Mr. Gangster and get 'em all open
The theories, the stories, the truth, the myths
Its all therapy on top of turntable riffs

This industry's big, so big in fact
We can all get some and we can give some back
And if its done correct, we'll make more than noise
So pick it up and pick me up when you're bored with the toys

As a child Hip Hop made me read books
And Hip Hop made me wanna be a crook
And Hip Hop gave me the way and something to say
And all I took in return was a second look

Son, you're shook, 'cause ain't no such thing as half way there
Gettin' good at actin' like you just don't care
The circle of life trying to make it square condition
And self sit still and stare

Where have all the sheep gone
Burnt down the farm and turned the TV on
John Coltrine, Marvin Gaye and Bob Marley
All get invitations to my party

He said, some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, well right on

And if I spent anymore time inside my head
I'd probably need some leather straps attached to my bed
And if I go another day without eatin' a meal
I'm gonna show you what it means to keep it real

And if they keep shootin' guns up and down my block
I swear to God I'll be the first one to call the cops
And if I gotta hear that song ever again
You gonna have to share some of that beer, my friend

They mistake me as happy-go-lucky
Just another bass-head bobbin' nobody
But from where I stand, they sound like spies
Fillin' all the children's heads with lies

Well alright, get your money right
But right now tonight I want you to pick a side
So when you got your power and you got your cheddar
Let's get together soldier overthrow this hold and make these roads better

Bring it on (right now)
He said bring it onâ€¦ (right now)
He looked you in the eye and said bring it on (right now)
Ain't nothin' but a party y'all, lets get it on

He said, some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, well right on

He said, some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, well right on

He said, some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, well right on

He said, some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, well right on

He said, some got pencils and some got guns
Some know how to stand and some of them run
We don't get along, but we sing the same song
Party for the fight to write, well right on
