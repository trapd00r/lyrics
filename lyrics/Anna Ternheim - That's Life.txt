That's life
That's what all the people say
Right and high, in April and you shut down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that too
When I'm back on top
Again in June

I said that's life
And as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stumping on a dream
But I don't let it get me down
Cause this final world keep spinning around

That's life
That's what all the people say
Right and high in April and you shut down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that too
When I'm back on top
Again in June
