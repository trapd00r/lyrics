as we were talking outside it was cold
we were shivering yet warmed by the subject matter
my wife is in the next room 
we've been having troubles you know please don't tell her or anyone but i need to talk to somebody
you said wouldn't it be a shame if i knew how great i was 
five minutes before i died i'd be filled with such regret
before i took my last breath
and I said you're willing to tell me this now and
you're not going to die any time soon
and I said I haven't been eating chicken or meat or anything 
and you said yes but you've been wearing leather and 
laughed 
and said we're at the top of the food chain and yes you're still a fine woman and i cringed

i was hoping i was hoping we could heal each other
i was hoping i was hoping we could be raw together

we left the restaurant where the head waiter (in his 60s) said good-bye sir thank you for your business sir you're successful and 
established sir  and we like the frequency with which 
you dine here sir and your money and when i walked by thank you too dear
I was all pigtails and cords and there was a day when
i would've said something like hey dude I could buy and sell this place so kiss it I too 
once thought i was owed something

I was hoping i was hoping we could challenge each other
i was hoping i was hoping we could crack each other up

I too thought that when proved wrong i lost somehow
i too once thought life was cruel
it's a cycle you think i'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you 
i think you're insensitive
and i don't feel heard and i said do you believe we are fundamentally judgemental? fundamentally evil?
and you said yes i said i don't believe in revenge in right or wrong good or bad you said
well what about the man that i saw handcuffed in the emergency room bleeding after beating his kid and
she threw a shoe at his head.
i think that what he did was wrong and i would've had a hard time feeling compassion for him
i had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged.

i was hoping i was hoping we could dance together
i was hoping i was hoping we could be creamy together
