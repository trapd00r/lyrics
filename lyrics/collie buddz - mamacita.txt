I tek the next shot of tequila
The vibes tonight yeah so sweet yah
I mon spot this sweet senorita
Who a bounce to the bass and the tweeter
She look muy bonita (very beautiful)
The way she move remind me of Selina
She rock slow she dip slow
She only dance to reggae and calypso
Look how the dress hug up pon her hips 
Look how she move fast and a do it slow
Muy bonita
