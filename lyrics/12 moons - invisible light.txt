At the doors of Babylon, You are my Zion, 
Pacing Tiger, The keeper's cage, 
Invisible light shoots from your eyes, 
A sign I can see from my high rise, 

Another castle crumbles, another monkey falls, 
Just open up your joy and let the sailors climb the walls, 
I thought I saw you laughing 10 feet in the air, 
It doesn't matter if they touch you where because you can give me... 

An Invisible light, An invisible light uh-oh, 
An Invisible light, An invisible light uh-oh, 
An Invisible light, An invisible light uh-oh, 
An Invisible light, An invisible light to keep me alive oh, 
looking for the tension 
I can feel it with the fingers in my mind... 

Opiate Utopia is hotter by the hour, 
I found you a flower in a field, 
My invention, among the tired, among the poor, 
Among the broken, the huddled masses, 
Its your time... 

You answer to a new name that changes all the time, 
I'll call you anything you want if I can say it's mine. 
This story's never ending. 
My footprint's been erased. 
Here you are, kiss of Evil, 
I see your mouth, Or is it really... 

An Invisible light, An invisible light uh-oh, 
An Invisible light, An invisible light uh-oh, 
An Invisible light, An invisible light uh-oh, 
An Invisible light, An invisible light to keep me alive oh, 
Something really gets dimension, 
Can't you feel it bend your sense of time... 

Babylon, 
Where bricks of water and diamonds tower, 
Sailor's lust and swagger lazing in the moon's beams, 
Who's laser gaze penetrates this sparkling theater of excess and strobed lights, 
Painted Whores. Sexual Gladiators. Fiercely old Party Children. 
All waked from their slumber to debut the Baccara. 
Come to the Light! Into the Light! The Invisible Light...
