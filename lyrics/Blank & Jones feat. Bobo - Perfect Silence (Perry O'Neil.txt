The most perfect silence is 
When there's no need to speak 
The most perfect silence is 
When there's no need to explain 

The most perfect moment is 
When we just come from different circumstances 
But a stream of lust flows into the same direction 

The most perfect silence is 
When there's no need to show 
Something is true 
When you see the same picture 
From another point of view 

When there's no need to search the outside 
No need to linger on 
Not a single something left to distract you 
No need to want 

Don't you see how I long long 
How I long long 
For that moment to come? 

The most perfect silence is 
When there's no need to speak 
The most perfect silence is 
When there's no need to explain

When there's no need to search the outside 
No need to linger on 
Not a single something left to distract you 
No need to want 

Don't you see how I long long 
How I long long 
For that moment to come? 

Don't you see how I long long 
How I long long 
For that moment to come?
