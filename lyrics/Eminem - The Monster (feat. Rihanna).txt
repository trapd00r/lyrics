I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me

Been wanting my cake and eat it too, wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh, hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet

Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cuckier as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm

Rihanna:
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

Eminem:
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it could all be over

Tomorrow so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, Do you want this?
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders.)

Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think you've been wandering off
Down yonder and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen

'Cause I needed an intervention in this
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very things that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it

My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

Rihanna:
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing

Eminem:
Call me crazy but I had this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
I'm coming straight at MCs, blood get spilled

And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped the feelin' and shit that say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children, but if one kid

Out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw in the gold chump I will spend Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack

Maybe I need a straitjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the

Rihanna:
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
