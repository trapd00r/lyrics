Swing low
When you speak, speak low
Sing low
When you swing, swing low
I wonder how you found now that you're older again

Give me
And scare me with your fears
Tell me
'Cause I can't say what I don't hear
And I told you when I left this that I'm older now

But I wish I didn't have to grow up so fast

Leave me
Usually I'm better alone
Take me
Away and leave me at home

But I wish I didn't have to grow up so fast
Still feel like such a kid
Monsters in the closet, they know who I am
They know who I am
They know who I am

Prettiest horses they scream out your name
Prettiest horses they scream out your name
Tell me what you wanted for christmas
Tell me what you wanted for christmas
