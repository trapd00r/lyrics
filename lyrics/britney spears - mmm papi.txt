Baby
I can be your sweet baby
When things get crazy
Make sure you come and save me (Save me)

With this fast car
I can really get far
And don't break my heart
Let's make out (Let's make out! Let's make out!)

You can come take me away
There's no pressure play all day
Hold me tight and don't let go!
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You will always be there for me
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you

Stuck in
the middle of it all
To many people around me
Can you hear me call?
I look this way
And you're not there
If you don't mind
My soul out there

Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa

You can come take me away
There's no pressure play all day
Hold me tight and don't let go!
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You will always be there for me
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you

Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papi
Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi
Mmm Luvi, Mmm Luvi, Mmm Papi

You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt

You can come take me away
There's no pressure play all day
Hold me tight and don't let go!
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you
You love it when I'm freakin' out
Things get rough and there's no doubt
You will always be there for me
Mmm Papa love you
Mmm Papa love you

Now see
I'm mommy
And that makes you Papi
And that makes us Luvi

Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa
Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa
