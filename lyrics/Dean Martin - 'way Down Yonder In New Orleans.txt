Way down yonder in New Orleans
In the land of the dreamy dreams
There's a garden of Eden that's what I mean
Creole babies with flashing eyes
Softly whispering with the tender sighs
Stop, won't you give your lady fair
A little smile
Yeah, stop, you bet your life you'll linger there
A little while
Well there is heaven right here on earth with those beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans

Yeah, stop, you bet your life you'll linger there
A little while
