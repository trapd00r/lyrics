You're hallow and shallow
All the cowards said in silence
It's so hard to swallow,
When you're someone that nobody wants
(I'm the one asking questions here)
About all the devils and tyrants
(I hope you hear me loud and clear)
I'll be the only speaking out

Just call my name out loud...
Just call my name
When it feels like you're slipping away
Don't look back, don't you ever look back
Until we meet again

Just call my name
When it feels like you're slipping away
Don't look back, don't you ever look back
Until the judgement day

We're battered and broken
All the members said in frustration
(We're not getting any younger here)
So how about a declaration?

Just call my name out loud...
Just call my name
When it feels like you're slipping away
Don't look back, don't you ever look back
Until we meet again

Just call my name
When it feels like you're slipping away
Don't look back, don't you ever look back
Until the judgement day

Battered and broken
These words are spoken in despair

We're battered and broken
These words are spoken in despair
And you don't even care
[x3]

Just call my name
When it feels like you're slipping away
Don't look back, don't you ever look back
Until the judgement day

Just call my name
When it feels like you're slipping away (feels like you're slipping away)
Don't look back, don't you ever look back
Until we meet again (until we meet again)

Just call my name
When it feels like you're slipping away (feels like you're slipping away)
Don't look back, don't you ever look back
Until the judgement day
