toy boy -

Everbody's talking when ther see me walking
with this little boy of mine

He's my play thing and I love him

I dress him up looking fine.
He ain't got money
people think it's funny
he gives me everything I need

He's my playboy and my love toy and I want everyone to know:

He's my toy boy
toy boy
I'm out with my toy boy
toy boy

When I want a lover
don't need any other

I know he'll come rvnning to me

He's my gigolo and my Romeo

And I want everyone to know:

He's my toy boy
toy boy

I'm out with my toy boy

..
And when I get to take him

I know he's gonna love me right.
He's my toy boy
