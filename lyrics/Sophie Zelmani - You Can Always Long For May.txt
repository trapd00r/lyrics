Don't go after him
Don't go after him
Don't go after him
Don't go
On our walk today
You were about to lift and stir against
Where he's been blowing to
Don't get fooled by him
It isn't him, it's just may
You feel on your skin
It's making love to you
As it didn't know
How love can make
One's sorrow grow
Take me home again
I will lock you in
Until you've rested on the couch
I loved it yesterday
You took me out of play
But for every laugh
I hear a cry and a prayer
So when day is done
Please don't go
He doesn't want you to
He doesn't want you
To go his way
You can't ask for him
He won't let you in
You can always long for may
I'll bring your lovers here
Steal them from everywhere
All lovers you might need
One to make you sleep
One to make you live
And one to make you breathe
Please don't go
Don't be thinking of
You will find him on the way
He is gone, he'll never come
But you
Can always long for may
Don't go after him
Don't go after him
Don't go after him
