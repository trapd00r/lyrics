(Chorus)
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kissing spring.
My Summerwine is really made from all these things...
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingle too,
a song that I had only singed to just a few.
She saw my silver spurs and said 'let's pass some time
and I will give to you
summerwine
Oh!, summerwine
(Chorus)
take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
and I wil give to you
summerwine
Oh, oh!, summerwine
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar lie
and then she gave to me
more summerwine 
More summerwine
(Chorus)
take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
and I will give to you
summerwine
Mm, mm, summerwine
When I woke up the sun was shinning in my eyes,
my silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
and left me craving for
more summerwine
more summerwine
(Chorus)
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
and I will give to you
my summerwine
Oh, oh! summerwine
