Another sleepless night
I open my eyes
I found the reason why

I feel the time has come
To make it on my own
I'm heading for the sun

I'm walking away
To find a brighter day
I'm walking away
No reason left to stay

I'm walking away

I'm walking away

I'm walking away

I'm walking away

I'

I still feel safe and sound
But it's time to break new ground
And turn my life around

I've wasted too much time
On things I could not find
I leave this place behind

I'm walking away
To find a brighter day
I'm walking away
No reason left to stay

I'm walking away

I'm walking away

I'

I'm walking away

I'm walking away
