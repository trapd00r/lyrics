You might see me in the street
But nigga you don't know me
When ya holla on the street
Rememba you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the poppin'
Nigga you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas you my partna
Nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie keep it movin
Nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp the truth is
Really you don't know me
Ya you know they call me T.I.
But you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why
'Cause you don't know me

I think its time I made a song fo niggas who don't know me
I graduated out the streets, Ima real OG
I been trappin shootin pistols since I stood 4 feet
So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon have to show me
You gone make me bring da chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin', wonder when it's gonna cease
Choppa hitchu on the side and create a slow leak
We can end the speculation 'cause today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I giva fuck about the feds investigation on me
I don't care they at my shows and they waitin on me
Ima keep a flossin poppin' long as Toomp is on the beat
Tell police that I ain't stoppin' Ima keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo believes, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings nigga you don't know me.

Hey once again let me remind you nigga you don't know me
So don't be walkin' up and askin what's the deal on a key.
I don't know if you wearin wires you could be the police
If I was slangin dope you couldn't get an OZ
See me at the PSC follow through and tha show deep
Police holdin' up the door, 'cause they know we tote heat
I just wanna wrap a C, blowin' dro ina fleet
Only hittin 'bout a dozen different bitches ina week
I just wanna chill with Kuntry and his daddy Freddy G
Ballin out @ anytime, hit every store and spend a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas curtousy of KT
MacBoney gotta Mill. as well as a dolla DP
Ak house on the hill right next to JG
Everyweek meet there for lunch, restaurant and eat free
Get inda paid Lil Craig an G
That's the only shot we got at gettin' Cap back on the streets

You see a nigga hatin' on a G
Ask 'em what's it gonna be
Whatcha lookin' at, pussy nigga you don't know me
At the club, in the streets
Or where ever we should meet
It's choppas choppin pistols poppin' nigga you don't know me [2x]
