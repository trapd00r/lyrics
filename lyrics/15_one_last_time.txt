I won the talk show
Guess that'll have to do
Up all night
BBM-ing you

Outta Tylenol
Head still aches
Got enough strength
To flip a pancake

Got the luggage packed
Waiting by the front
Quarter after five
It's already one

I'll say it one last time
Walking out the door. 4:59

5:15. Not a minute more
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15. Not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

I think I've gone dumb
Sick on puppy love
Wanna break out
[Album version:] Think I've had enough
[Acoustic version:] Never had enough

The walls are caving in
And my thick skin
Is feeling kinda thin
You find your way back in

Never thought in May
When we came to June
I would feel this way
About you

But I'll say it one last time
I'm walking out the door at 4:59

5:15. Not a minute more
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15. Not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

At 5:15
Ready for the knock on my door
5:15. Not a minute more
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

I won't wait another minute, no
When the waves are at my shore
Ready for the waves on my shore
And at 5:16 if you're not with me
You can catch me in the next city
Never knew you meant that much to me
Until 5:15

Five
I'll be waiting for you
Until 5:15
