My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight

I'd like to put you in a trance

If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try to reject it

If I'm in charge
And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up
Do as I say
Give it up
And let me have my way

I'll give you love
I'l hit you like a truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to

Uh
I'd like to put you in a trance
All over

Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic

Once you put your hand in the flame
It will never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
And a little bit of pain

I can see you understand
I can tell you're the same
If you're afraid, we'll rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

Give it up
Do as I say
Give it up
And let me have my way

I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to

Uh
I'd like to put you in a trance
All over

Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic

Erotica romance
Put your hands all over my body

I don't think you know
What pain is
I don't think
You've gone that way
I could bring you
So much pleasure

I'll come to you when you say
I know you want me
I'm not going to hurt you
Just close your eyes

Erotic
Put your hands all over my body

All over me
All over me

(Give it up, give it up)
I'd like to put you
In a trance

Erotica romance
(Give it up, give it up)
I'd like to do a different
Kind of uh

Only the one that hurts you
Can make you feel better
Only the one that inflicts the pain
Can take it away
