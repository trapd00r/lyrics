Hello, you don't know me
But I stole your laptop and I took your TV
I sold your granny's rosary
For 50 p.

And I even pulled an odd hijack
Said I had a hypodermic in me backpack
But I was only bluffing

Oh, so long I've been a junkie
I ought to wrap it up and mind my monkeys
I really want to mend my ways
I'm gonna call that number one of these days
It's not too late

I'm the one who sits in the back room
I'm the one who doesn't know how to have fun
I'm the one to smoke amiss all around me
'Cause I don't like no one around me

'Cause if I love someone
I might lose someone
'Cause if I love someone
I might lose someone

Oh so long I've been a junkie
I ought to wrap it up and mind my monkeys
I really want to mend my ways
I'm gonna call that number one of these days

I'm gonna reach a hand out to you
Say, would you pull me up, now could you?
I don't want to waste the life God gave me
And I don't think that it's too late to save me
It's not too late

Reason with me
Let's reason together
Let's reason together

Reason with me
Let's reason together
Reason with me
Let's reason together
Reason with me
