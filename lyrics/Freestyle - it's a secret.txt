Well maybe I'n being foolish
But I can not pretend
It's no secret
What is happening to me

I wonder if you realise
and what you intend it's no secret
and it's not meant to be

And all the boys that I once knew
Have disappeared from view
All the things that used to please
Are nothing now it's true
I offer you this Kingdom
To share for awhile

It's no secret
I offer you my life
It's no secret
I offer you my life

It's funny when I look inside
To find that other girl
She is watching and whispering to me

I tell her all about you
and she cannot believe the difference in the way things used to be
