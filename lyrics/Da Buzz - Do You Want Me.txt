Do you want me?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me?

You came in everyone turned around,
Just to see your beautiful face,
The stars and the moon shining in your eyes,
Could not believe that you wanted me.

A little kiss, and I thought I could die,
I was standing so close to you,
My heart beated faster as I started to say,
In other words, baby, you are all I need.

I can’t understand that you are here,
Do you want me?
I just can’t believe that you are real.
Do you really want me?
I can’t understand that you are mine.
Do you want me?
I just can’t believe that you’re so fine.
Do you really want me?

Everytime, when I see you around,
Don’t understand how you make up your mind,
You choose and pick up every girl that you like,
You wouldn't be the angel for me.

But now I see that your heart is so pure,
It must be good, too good to be true,
My heart beats faster as you start to say,
In other words, baby, you are all I need.

I can’t understand that you are here,
Do you want me?
I just can’t believe that you are real.
Do you really want me?
I can’t understand that you are mine.
Do you want me?
I just can’t believe that you’re so fine.
Do you really want me?

Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Do you want me?

Take my hand,
Look in my eyes,
Take your time, and make me wanna fly.
I think I love you, do do do you want me?

Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Do you want me?
Do you really want me?

I can’t understand that you are mine.
Do you want me?
I just can’t believe that you’re so fine.
Do you really want me?
