I won't make no commiments no
I can't let myself just go
as much as I want to my heart says no

I'm sorry but I can't stay
I hope that you'll forgive when I say

(chorus:)
Darling I
Don't have a heart for you right now
Somebody's playing with my mind
But all I'm dreaming of is to be able to love

I can't give you no guarantees
If that's what you want from me
I should have known better but now you see

I'm sorry but I can't stay
I hope that you'll forgive me when I say

(chorus)
All I want is treat you right but I know I can't pretend
It will take just a litttle longer finding the key to love again
