Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away you rolling river
I'll take her across the water
Away, I'm bound away
Cross the wide Missouri

My Shenandoah, I long to meet you
Away you rolling river
I'll not deceive you
Away, away
Cross the wide Missouri

For seven years I've been a rollin'
Away you rolling river
Seven years I've been a rollin'
Away, I'm bound away
Cross the wide Missouri

Shenandoah, I love your daughter
The way you rolling river
I'll take her across the water
Away, bound away
Cross the wide Missouri
