Everything here, close to me
Is just the way I want it to be
It's all about faith, it's all about trust
All about luck, not about lust
My wish comes true 
My wish comes true 

I don't mind showing for you
I reveal everything for you
Just about anything

Could it be night, could it be day
Floating in space I was drifting away
You're making me warm, you're making me high
I feel like laughing where I used to cry
My wish comes true


My dream comes true

I don't mind showing for you
I reveal everything for you
Just about anything for you
I reveal everything for you
Just about anything

I don't mind showing for you
I reveal everything for you
Just about anything for you
I reveal everything for you
Just about anything for you
Everything for you
Anything for you
