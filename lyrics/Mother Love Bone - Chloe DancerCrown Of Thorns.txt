Chloe don't know better
Chloe's just like me, only beautiful
A couple of years' difference
But those lessons never learned
Did you know?

Chloe does the tables in the French Quarter
She's always been given
So I can't always make her laugh
But I'm proud to say
And I won't forget

The times spent layin' by her side (ooh yeah)
The times spent layin' by her side (ooh yeah)
Dreams like this must die
And a dream like this must die
Dream like this must

You ever heard the story of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say he who rides the pony must someday fall
Talkin' to my altar, say life is what you make it
And if you make it death, well rest your soul away
Away, away, yeah child

It's a broken kind of feelin', she'd have to tie me to the ceiling
A bad moon's a-comin', better say your prayers, child
I wanna tell you that I love you but does it really matter?
I just can't stand to see you draggin' down again, again
My baby again, oh yeah

So I'm singin'
And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone
Yes it does

And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone

I used to treat you like a lady
Now you're a substitute teacher
This bottle's not a pretty, not a pretty sight
I owe the man some money, so I'm turnin' over honey
See, Mr. Faded Glory is once again doin' time, oh yeah

And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind the leaves me alone
Yes it does

And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, it's the kind that
It leaves me alone, yeah

Like a crown of thorns
It's all who you know, yeah
So don't burn your bridges woman
'Cause someday, yeah

Kick it, oh yeah

And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone, yeah

This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, it's the kind that, yeah yeah

Baby
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, do it
I said baby
Don't burn your bridges woman
Don't come back here
I said good times
I said tu tu tu
