Like when you told me that my love was just aesthetic
And I fell into the beauty of another
And it was in the summer
Confusion was a-bloom in every little corner
Oh don't you understand
don't you understand
don't you understand
don't you understand?

How lonely it gets
How lonely it gets
How lonely it gets
How lonely it gets?

And then you said to me that I was cold and stern
and said it like you meant I wasn't a woman
and then you intellectualized my emotion
and called me baby baby baby baby in a wrong way,
oh Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste
Such a lack of taste lack of taste
Such a lack of taste lack of taste!

I never wanna see your pretty face again
I don't think I'll be your lifelong friend
I don't wanna carry any of your pain
I'm never gonna talk to you and
I'll never explain 'cause
you never get me right
never get me right
never get me right
even if you'd try
you'd never understand
you never get me right
you never listen tight
you never get me right
oh
