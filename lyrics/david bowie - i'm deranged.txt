Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return
No return

I'm deranged
I'm deranged down down down
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe, cruise me babe beyond

And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby

The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged

And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, babe

I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
