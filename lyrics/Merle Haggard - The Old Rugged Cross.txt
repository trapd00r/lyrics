On a hill far away, stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

In the Bible, we read of the beauties of Heaven
And the place Christ has gone to prepare
And eyes have not seen and ears have not heard
What awaits us in Heaven, in that city four-square
We'll walk and talk with our loved ones
And we'll see the savior face-to-face
And we'll sing praises to Him forever
And forever we'll thank Him for his amazing grace
But we must prepare while we live here below
So to claim our inheritance that waits
And if we neglect so great a salvation
We can never enter Heaven's gates
You know, we'll be joint heirs with Christ in that home
And together, we'll walk the streets with Him made of pure gold
And we'll live in a mansion not made by human hands
And forever watch the mysteries of Heaven unfold

These words were written by my Mother. And as of the recording of this album, which was finished in April of '81, she's of sound body and mind and I'm proud to say she's about to celebrate her 79th birthday. And with the exception of some mental scars brought about by her youngest and most wayward son, I believe she's fine. And I want to dedicate this album to her, which I've titled For The Mama That Tried. Mom, this one's for you.

But I also want to dedicate it to an old friend of mine who is a leading character in these recordings and gave his life for all of us.

I will cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
