I was five and he was six
we rode on horses made of sticks
he wore black and I wore white
he would always win the fight

bang bang, he shot me down
bang bang, I hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, my baby shot me down.

down down d-down......

Bang bang, I shot you down
bang bang, you hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, I used to shoot you down.

Now he's gone I don't know why
until this day sometimes I cry
he didn't even say goodbye
he didn't take the time to lie

bang bang, he shot me down
bang bang, I hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, my baby shot me down.

Bang bang, I shot you down
bang bang, you hit the ground
bang bang, that awful sound
bang bang, I used to shoot you down
