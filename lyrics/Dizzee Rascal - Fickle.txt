Deep -- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind...
Deep -- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind...
Deep-de-deep Roll Deep through the depths of my mind...

Lord knows what I'll find when I re-re-rewind

Deep-- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind...
Deep-de-deep Roll Deep through the depths of my mind...
'Cause I deep-- Roll Deep through the depths of my mind...

Lord knows what I'll find when I reach

'Cause I've got so much to say... in so little time...
In such a short space, I've got so much to do...
But if I can't find a way around, I'll find a way across
And if I can't find a way across, I'll bore straight through...
I find myself in a pickle... this music ain't fickle...
Surrounded by big dawgs and I consider them lickle...
As they crash the particle... the other giants...
I might apply some knowledge and wait for a ripple...
On my shoulder is a ripple
Some love it... some hate the idea of (no idea)
Squeeze a dollar from a nickel...
