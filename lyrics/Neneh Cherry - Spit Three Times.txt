I thought you were gone, out of my life
I'm not surprised, clever disguise
But you're like a demon, want to feed
Into satisfy real lies

Monkeys on my back
Holding me down
Black dogs in the corner
Looking up at me

I'm superstitious, spit three times over my shoulder
I hit the ground hard
It's you
I got the fever in me

Sneak in the dark, snuck to my bed
Crawling my spine, time has gone by
Know how you hide, clever disguise
Little time flies, it's how I get by

But you're like an old friend or an enemy
Holding me down
Black dogs in the corner
Looking up at me

I'm superstitious, spit three times over my shoulder
I hit the ground hard
It's you
I'm addicted to you
You're the fever, baby
I got the fever in me
You're addicted to me

How is it gonna go?
Baby you know
You're the fever that's me

I'm superstitious, spit three times over my shoulder
I hit the ground hard
It's you
I got the fever in me
It's you
Hit the ground hard
It's you
I'm addicted to you
You're the fever, baby
I got the fever in me
You're the fever that's me
How is it gonna go?
Leave me alone
You're addicted to me
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I'm addicted to you
