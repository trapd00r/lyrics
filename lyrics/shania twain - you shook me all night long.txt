She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen

She had sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs

Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there

'Cause the walls started shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was achin'
And we were makin' it and you...

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long

Walking double time on the seduction line
She was one of a kind
She's just mine all mine

Wanted no applause
It's just another cause
Made a meal out of me, and come back for more

Tried to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

But the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you...

Shook me all night long
Yeah you, shook me all night long
Knocked me out, I said you
Shook me all night long
Had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Had me shaking
Well you shook me...

You really shook me and YOU
Shook me all night long
Aaaaahaaaahaaaah You...
Shook me all night long
Yeah yeah you
Shook me all night long
You really got me and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me
Yeah you shook me
All night long
