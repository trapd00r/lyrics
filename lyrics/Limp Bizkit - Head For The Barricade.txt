Fight! fight!
Fight! fight!

Sometimes you gotta fight for your right when you're
Not sure you're in a fight for your life, right?
If you ain't packin' any tactics you might get your ass kicked
Even if you are a little knuckle head
I'm kinda sick of being aggravated, I'm glad I'm hated
I guess I'm doin' somethin' right
That's what happened back in columbine
You gotta know when to stop and don't go over the top
'Cause there's a chamber deep inside the brain
That's covered with chains, so don't be shakin' 'em loose
And if ya do, I'd be runnin' for the hills
'Cause I'm ready to rock and now I'm playin' for real
I gotta, fight! fight!
You'd better watch out when my adrenaline kicks
I gotta, fight! fight!
It's too late you already been hit! damn!

Stick 'em stick 'em
Stick 'em ha ha ha stick em
Stick 'em stick 'em
Yeah, head for the barricade
(x2)

This world can make you sick to your stomach so i
Put on my headphones, listen to the deftones
It's gettin' crowded in my spaceship
Livin' in a dream, runnin' from a hate machine
Ya know it's such a drag when there's people talking down to ya
Such a drag thinking everything sucks (do ya?)
Walk away with the spit on your face?
Or do ya draw the line just to give 'em a taste?
'Cause I know it's never gonna end,
If it happens again I'm going straight for the throat
Another note, don't forget your had a chance
Now off of the side lines and ready to dance
I gotta, fight! fight!
You'd better watch out when my adrenaline kicks
I gotta, fight! fight!
It's too late you already been hit! damn!

Stick 'em stick 'em
Stick 'em ha ha ha stick em
Stick 'em stick 'em
Yeah, head for the barricade
(x2)

If you got the guts (head for the barricade)
Then come on down (head for the barricade)
If you got the guts! (head for the barricade)
Then come on down
And head for the barricade!

Fight! fight!
Fight! fight! (get up! get up!)
Fight! fight! (get up! get up!)
Fight! fight!
Head for the barricade

I ain't playin' around
Head for the barricade
I ain't playin' around
Head for the barricade

Stick 'em stick 'em
Stick 'em ha ha ha stick em
Stick 'em stick 'em
Yeah, head for the barricade
