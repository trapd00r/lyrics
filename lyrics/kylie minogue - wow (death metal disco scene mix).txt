Read my lips, I'm into you
I'm into you
Can't resist, you're so hot
Get me into the shade

The spotlight's on, you take me to it
You like it and
Just the way that you dance
Just the way that you dance

Yeah, yeah, is enough to love me baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, is enough to send me crazy
Yeah, yeah, such an angelic motion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know you're made in heaven

The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you smells of desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

The more I try, I try to stop
The more I can feel
My antenna just sensing you up

And what can I do? I'm into you
I'm into you
Love the way that you move
Just love the way that you move

Yeah, yeah, such an angelic motion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know you're made in heaven

The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you smells of desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you smells of desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you smells of desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

Wow
