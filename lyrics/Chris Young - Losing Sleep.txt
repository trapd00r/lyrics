Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby let's just lose control
Lose control

I can handle
Every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you
Oh

Fall into me
Let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you want to be
When it comes to us
Every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets

Yeah we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Real life
When it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby so

Fall into me
Let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you want to be
When it comes to us
Every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets

Yeah we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep, yeah

Fall into me
Let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you want to be, yeah
When it comes to us
Every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets

Yeah we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep, yeah
Yeah we're winning when we're losing

Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
