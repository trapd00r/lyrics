Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone from the frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall
Father didn't like you at all
Do you remember the reason why we marries in the fall
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well here we are just above the Seine
Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

(Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall)

Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight
Bon soir Bon nuit
