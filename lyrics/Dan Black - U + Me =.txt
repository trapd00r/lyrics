With you I'm brighter
My eyes like lighters
They shine inside my parka

Up with the wind
Up with the skies
Up with the fears
But you know with you I'm fine

You and me, we're just fine
One million invisible lines
Out your head and into mine
You and me, we're just fine
One million invisible lines
Out your head and into mine
You and me, we're just fine
