I can never forget
The way you held your arms around me
I guess I have to admit
I was afraid to end up lonely

Can't imagine life without you
'Cause I don't wanna have another lover
Yes I adore you
But I won't be coming back

Did it make you feel good to see me hurt
To see me hurting
Happy to see you broke me first
Hey baby do you believe
You gave me what you thought I deserve
Do you believe you conquered what

Are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely
Baby are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely

How could you forget
I was the one you kept on blaming
You said I made you upset
It wasn't true what you were claiming

And there will be no regrets
This time I think I leave you hanging
No there is no longer you and I you and I
Cause you later ground stranded
So tell me baby

Did it make you feel good to see me hurt
To see me hurting
Happy to see you broke me first
Hey baby do you believe

You gave me what you thought I deserve
Do you believe you conquered what

Are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely
Baby are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely

Hey, for leaving me
Leaving me
For leaving me
Leaving me

Lea, Lea, Lea, Leaving me
Lea, Lea, Lea, Leaving me
Lea, Lea, Lea, Leaving me
Lea, Lea, Lea, Leaving me

Are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely
Baby are you lonely
I hope you're feeling lonely

Are you lonely
So tell me
Baby are you lonely
Baby are you lonely

So tell me
Baby are you lonely
Baby are you lonely

For leaving me
