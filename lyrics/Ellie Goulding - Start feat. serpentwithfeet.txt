I was old when I was younger
All the lives I'm not living
Always trying to pull me under
Feel like I've been barely living
But I keep getting struck by the thunder
Maybe we don't need the bigger picture
Cause all I see is everything I've done called into question
Sorry what was the question?
And you don't know how much I missed the winter
It's been the longest summer, game without a winner
And you can't even begin to understand
The magic she had before you killed her

I could call a truce for anyone but you
And I could change the truth for anyone but you
I guess what I'm trying to say is, you changed me
Oh why can't things just stay the same, stay the same
I'm thinking about how many times I've had to recover
All I do is start again
I'm thinking about a new beginning
It's never too late to start again

Start again, start again, start again
All I do is
Start again, start again, start again

I separate my colours like a prism
I try to be myself but I'm stuck in your religion
Love keeps blurring my vision
I can't beat the narcissism
I think I'm gonna reinvent myself again
Wash off all the paint cause it runs away but I know it stains
You were always there, but you never stayed

I could call a truce for anyone but you
I could change the truth for anyone but you
I guess what I'm trying to say is, you changed me
Oh why can't things just stay the same, stay the same
I'm thinking about how many times I've had to recover
All I do is start again
I'm thinking about a new beginning
It's never too late to start again

Start again, start again, start again
All I do is
Start again, start again, start again

Every summer my friends prevent me from using the grill
They believe Cancer men don't have the will to play with fire
But I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm cutting my man off
Yes, I will burn this bridge
No, I do not want him
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm cutting my man off
Yes, I will burn this bridge
No, I do not want him
I'm gonna prove them wrong
I'm cutting my man off
Yes, I will burn this bridge
No, I do not want him

Fighting against what I'm fighting for
Another walk to the liquor store
Trying to break me down a little more
You fuck with me I'll start a war
Fighting against what I'm fighting for
Another walk to the liquor store
Trying to break me down a little more
You fuck with me I'll start a war
(You fuck with me I'll start a war)
(I'm moving on from him)
I'm moving on from him
