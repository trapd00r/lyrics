And the wills of the river
Leads you here
Where the wind it is yielding
And the light it is clear

To rest upon forever
Or to live for one more day
No I won't restrain the morning
I'll get ready for this spring

Oh see them planets shining
To the south to the north
Headed out the west wind
Going to find myself a home

Where the night it is guarded
By the shores of the sea
And the moon it is resting
While the sun it breaks free

And the world is all alone now
While it's children still sleep
Silently
