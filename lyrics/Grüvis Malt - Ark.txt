Threw caution as far as we could
And built a house there
Surrounded by simple things
To make our lives hard

Our night guarded the door
With the precision of a guillotine
Tried to hold 'em back
But it only served to lead

Keep building
You'll get there
Even if you're not supposed to change
The more you expand the closer you get to breaking


Falling from the sky, guests arrive
So drag 'em in and prop 'em up
Come on baby bear and don't be scared
It's gonna be a new suit morning

From the sky, guests arrive
So drag 'em in and prop 'em up
Go on little one and get the gun
It's gonna be a new suit morning


The walls they start the giving in
A thousand hearts stop beating
But you'll wake up in a new suit tomorrow


All this open land
On top of the best of both worlds
Was too good to last
Past a photograph
It's blurry so it looks like we're moving fast

But we stood still watched as the bridge fused itself to our front porch
And with it's legs planted firmly
This open lipped, hip city crept up
Populated by a runaway snowball
That was soon enough through the door

Our guests turned the walls into windows
And brought some wine that made us spill our guts and thensome

Multiplying
By the minute
Even if your house can't hold the weight
The more you let in, the closer you get to living
