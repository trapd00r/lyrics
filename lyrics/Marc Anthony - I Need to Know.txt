They say around the way you've asked for me
there's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I wanna hear
But thats just talk until you take me there, oh 
If it's true don't leave me all alone out here
Wonderin' if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feelin' 'cause I need to know
Girl you gotta let me know which way to go 

'Cause I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know 

My every thought is of this being true
It's getting harder not to think of you
Girl I'm exactly where I wanna be
The only thing is I need you here with me, oh
If it's true don't leave me all alone out here 
Wonderin' if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell Me What you're feelin' 'cause I need to know
Girl you gotta let me know which way to go 

'Cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know

If it's true don't leave me all alone out here 
Wonderin' if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feelin' 'cause I need to know
Girl you gotta let me know which way to go 

'Cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know

Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know
If it's true don't leave me all alone out here 
Wonderin' if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell Me What you're feelin' 'cause I need to know
Girl you gotta let me know which way to go 

'Cause I need to know

Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know
