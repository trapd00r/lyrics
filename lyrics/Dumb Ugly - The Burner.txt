(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
(Ayo, Dzimi got the sauce, boy)
Still a robber from the paul bearer, from the burner
Still right out from the burner

Dumb shit, you know that I'm walking with it on me
I say stomp him, then that's when they stepping on your homie
I say stretch him, catch me murder walking then I bang
Pushing next to them, rip down, draw down on you, what you saying?

This no facade, we up the rod, we known to send shit up to God
You say it's war, I do your asses like I done them fucking boys
Hold on say, why they tryna play like Top ain't raw
Been up inside beef for some years but still ain't dead yet in this foreign car
PTR on me, looking like this bitch a sewing saw
Son say in my passenger seat just like a pornstar
Murder gang, two handles on that .223 like devil horns
Call the police, don't call the reverend for him (Fuck that boy)
Bah-bah-bah, he already dead, yeah
Caught that nigga fumbling then they did him bad
Gang baby had to fight in jail in different parish
Check off shit with PayPals with certain assassins
His family know we stepped on him, I wish I could spit in his casket
Fuck him, I been thugging, and bet nan one of you bitches still gon' touch this shit
This shit ain't pretty since I came in, it been ugly
I whip out my blicky, tell my bitch just for to kiss it if she love me

Hold on, stop the static, yeah, slang that ratchet
Wait outside his home and put shit up the fastest
And just in case this shit get hectic, the FN tactic
You know them hollows coming through shit soon as I blast it
I say this a murder zone, right here where my granddad home
Make sure that I got "Gravedigger" engraved in my tombstone
Them pistols beating up off a beat, since he wanna make a song
Tell him I'm that same nigga with holes in my shoes walkin' around
Fuck it, we gon' knock him down
Green dot, millionaire up in the Cutlass and this bitch not T top
Jumping out that gang mobile, it smell like reefer
I am not no rapper, I'm your fucking teacher
Bloody nigga walk in cocaine white tryna turn up the meter
Talk your shit, you gon' lose your life the same day I meet you
This that real right shit can't keep cool say 5 soon as I swung that heater
This that hitchhike shit, paul bearers bring him out, drag him to the reaper
