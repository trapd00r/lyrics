Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
The people who saw, they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewheres else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
Visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold is high, eternity near
She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
Visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
