I wake up
And the day feels broken
I tilt my head
I'm trying to get an angle

'Cause the evening
I've always longed for
It could still happen

How do I master
The perfect day
Six glasses of water
Seven phonecalls

If you leave it alone
It might just happen
Anyway

It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you

If you wake up
And the day feels broken
Just lean into the crack
(Just lean into the crack)
And it will tremble
Ever so nicely
Notice how it sparkles
Down there

I can decide what I give
But it's not up to me
What I get given

Unthinkable surprises about to happen
But what they are

It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
No, it never really was
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you
(It's not up to you)
(It's not up to you)
(It's not up to you)

There's too much
Clinging to peak
There's too much
Pressure
