My everything, everything, everything
You are my everything, you are my everything
You, my everything

It's all because of you
I'm never sad and blue
You brighten up my day
In your own special way
Whenever you're around
I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend
On you I can depend

[chorus]
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And then on a cloudy day, you brought sunshine into my life
It never occurred to me, the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced
You are my (you are) everything (you are my everything)
Love so good (love so good, so good, so good, so good) only you can bring
You are my (you are my) everything
You are everything, and everything is you

My darling, only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything

(When your loving me) 
with your loving arms around me 
(When your loving me) 
said i feel so safe about security 
(When your loving me) 
forever oooo i want you to hold me 
my every every every everything everything 

(Repeat Chorus til End) 

Take me away
[fading]
