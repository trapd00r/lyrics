So tired, tired of all this drama
You go your way
I'll go mine
(No more, no more)
I need to be free
I'm so tired, tired, tired of all this drama

Broken heart again
Another lesson learned
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee
That I'll be fine

(No more pain) No more pain
(No more pain) No more pain
(No drama) No more drama in my life
(No more in my life)
No one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
But maybe I liked the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

(No more pain) No more pain, no more pain, no
(No more games) No more games
Messin' with my mind
(No drama) No more drama in my life
(No more in my life)
No oneï¿½s gonna make me hurt again, no more
(No more tears) No more tears
I'm tired of crying every night
(No more fears) No more fears
I really don't wanna fight
(No drama) No more drama in my life
(No more in my life)
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind
Wanna speak my mind

Oh it feels so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (free from all the pain)
Free from all the games (free from all the games)
Free from all the stress (free from all the stress)
To find your happiness

I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or lose
And I choose to win

(No more pain)
No more pain, no more pain, tired of hurting
(No more games)
Tired of you playin' games with my mind
(No drama) No more drama in my life
(No more in my life)
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
(No more tears)
No more tears
No more crying every night
(No more fears)
No more waking me up in the morning
With your disturbing phone calls
(No drama) Leave me alone, go ahead
(No more in my life)
(No more pain) No more, I'm tired
(No more game)
No more games, I'm tired, I'm so tired
(No drama) No more, no more
(No more in my life)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
(No more drama)
I'm tired of all the drama
(No more drama)
Go ahead, go ahead
(No more drama)
You demons gettin' out of my face
Goin' out my life
(No more drama)
I'm about to lose my mind
Lord help me, help me sing
(No more drama) No more drama
(No more drama) No more, no more
(No more drama) No more drama
(No more drama)
Oh, help me sing
I need a peace of mind
(No more drama)
A piece of mind, piece of mind
Well, I need
(No more drama)
Oh at night to sleep
I need to know that you agree

Oh no, oh no
No more, no more, no more drama
No more drama in my, in my life
So tired, I'm so tired, so tired, tired of all this drama
Go ahead with all your drama
Wherever...
