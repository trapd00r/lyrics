I'm a one boy, one boy girl
You know I'm a one boy girl

Some girls, say in their world
They couldn't bear to have just him
But I, don't need a load of guys
To pump up my self esteem

Girl what you doin' with just one guy
Givin' all my lovin'
What you gonna do when
There's lipstick on his collar
You're gonna get old before your time
You can't tell me nothing,
'Bout this man of mine

No other love could ever
Compare to my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other touch could mean half as much
As my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl

Check it out
Some guys never realize
What a girl needs from a man
But my guy always satisfies
It's a love we understand

Don't you wanna go out and play
I'm sorry but I'm busy
What if you call and there isn't any answer
You're gonna find him gone one day
He'll always be with me no matter what you say

No other love could ever
Compare to my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other touch could mean half as much
As my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl

No other kiss is the one that I miss
With my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other man could love like he can
As my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl

Hey you Kylie... mmm hmmm
What's up with this one boy girl thing... well
Let me break it down like this, yeah right

It doesn't play to stay or be good
You know how guys are, I don't think he good
Be with just one, and what if he cheats ya
Girl just have fun go out and meet ya

Two or three more... I don't think so
You should see more... no I don't think so
How could you be sure... I believe him
You're in for heartbeat you don't need him

What if he hurts you... he won't do that
Are you sure... yeah that's a fact
There's lots of guys in this world
Not for me, I'm a one-boy-girl

No other love (no other love)
My lover, oh
One boy, one boy girl
No other touch (no other touch)
My lover, oh
One boy, one boy girl, yeah

No other love could ever
Compare to my lover
I'm a one boy, one boy girl
No other touch could mean half as much
As my lover
You know I'm a one boy girl
