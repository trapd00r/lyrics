I feel you moving on a different course
Making the way for a distant coast
You say you love me and you roll your eyes
Turn to stare at the empty skies

I thought it was over and we passed all that
All we've done is to pass back to frame number one
Come on now, now
I wanna show you all again what it would be like
If you just let go and let me love you

Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll die
Make you mine again

Hold me closer, oh, so good
You make me feel just like I should
I know what you're thinking, aha, good
Now the rest of the world is overruled

Tell me what you see in other girls all around
Come on closer and tell me what you don't find here
Come on now, now
I wanna give you everything, you've been missing out 
Just let go and let me love you

Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Everyway that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll die
Make you mine again

I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me wanna huh-huh
Make me wanna huh-huh-huh
I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me wanna huh-huh
Make me wanna huh-huh-huh

Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
Ooh... No no no no no!

Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll die
Make you mine again
