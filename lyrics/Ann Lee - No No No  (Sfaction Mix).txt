C'mon Gimme some company
I've got all dressed up now
Let's go out and have a laugh c'mon
Mmm should'a known

No no no no no!
No no no no no!
You just go alone oh oh
No no no no no!
Hm mm mm mm mm

Out to eat or for a drink
But you're too tired you gotta think
"I'll let you know" is what you say
"I'll tell you later on in the day"
But I know you'll say "no"
They're your friends
You just go alone

We've got friends out there you know
Why they still call I just don't know
"I'll let you know" is what you say
"I'll tell you later on in the day"
But I know you'll say "no"
They're your friends
You just go alone

"I'll let you know" is what you say
"I'll tell you later on in the day"
But I know you'll say "no"
They're your friends
You just go alone

"There's a nice film on the telly"
I've already seen it
No matter, I'll read a book or something
C'mon honet please say Yes!
But I know that you'll say
"No they're your friends you just go alone"

The same every time
C'mon change your mind
Say yes just this time
