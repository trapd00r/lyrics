Come here, please forgive me now
Don't know ff I dare to try
Come here, let me turn you by
Don't wanna cry again
Come on, let me kiss you now
Don't know if I dare to fly
Come on, let me turn you by
Don't wanna cry

I don't wanna break your heart
I just want a brand new start

Ba ba ba ba ba ba... 

Come here, don't be stiff and proud
It wasn't me who did the crime
Come here, it's hurts so bad inside
That's what they try for me
Come on, let me do you right
Well I didn't start the fight
I know, and I promise to be kind
Make up your mind

I don't wanna break your heart
I just want a brand new start

Ba ba ba ba ba ba... 

Let's stop breaking eachothers heart
We both want a brand new start
Lets forget about the pain
We both know our love will last

Come on! Ba ba ba ba ba ba...
