Won't you take me
Be my love next door
When you run out
I can bring some more
Won't you throw down
This heart of mine
And I'll roll out
My stretch of time
Oh my stretch of time...

Billy Opened
Up a can of worms
So I lit up
Smoke and let it burn
Will you come back
If I turn and run

Will you come find me
If I crash & burn?
If I crash & burn?
If I crash & burn?

Look so pretty when you brush your hair
Won't you be so kind to take me there
Will you come back if I turn and run?

Will you come find me
If I crash & burn?
If I crash & burn?
If I crash & burn?

Won't you take me
Be my love next door
When you run out
I can bring some more
When you run out
When you run out
