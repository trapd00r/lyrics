Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning as I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying (Ah what did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort this heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me, leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me, leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one

The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I've gotta get up and go
As in go home... (It's a cruel, cruel)

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me, leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me, leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one

Cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
Cruel summer
It's a cruel summer

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me, leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me, leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone, you're not the only one

Cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
Cruel summer
It's a cruel summer

It's a cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
It's a cruel summer

Cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
Cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
Cruel summer
It's a cruel summer
Cruel summer
