My life lasts forever
Let me be with you
There's still so much silence
That I'm going through
My tears are in heaven
But I must survive
When angels are crying
I'm ending my life

Take the radio melody
Sing with me
Play the song oh let it be
With the radio symphony
Set you free
What you get is what you see
Take the radio melody
Sing with me
Play the song oh let it be
With the radio symphony
Set you free
What you get is what you see
On the radio symphony

My dream lasts forever
So where are you now
I'm searching for nothing
Cause love dies somehow
No tears left in heaven
That help me survive,
The angels were crying,
While I lost my life.

Take the radio melody
Sing with me
Play the song oh let it be
With the radio symphony
Set you free
What you get is what you see
Take the radio melody
Sing with me
Play the song oh let it be
With the radio symphony
Set you free
What you get is what you see
On the radio symphony
