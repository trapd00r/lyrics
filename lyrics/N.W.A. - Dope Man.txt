Yo man what you need?
Yo ah man I need something, man
I need a 20 man.
How much you got man
I... I got this real chain man.
Man this shit look like that gold on a roll shit, man
It's real man
This shit ain't real, man, you better get the fuck outta here
And comeback wit some money, man
C'mon man be cool man
You Mexicans always come wit dis shit

Yo Dre, Kick in the Bass

Verse One: Ice Cube

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
Dope man please can I have another hit
The dope man said clucka, I don't give a shit
If your girl kneeled down and sucked my dick
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her
Nigga didn't care, she ain't nothin' but a smoka
That's the way it goes that's the name of the game
Young brotha gettin' over by slangin cane
Gold around his neck in 14 k heaven
Bitches jockin' on his dick 24-7 plus he's makin'
Money keepin' tha base heads waiting
Rollin' 6.4. wit tha fresh ass daytons
Livin' in Compton, Cailfornia CA
His uzi up yo ass if he don't get paid
Nigga begging for credit he's knockin' out teeth
Clockin much dollars on tha 1st and 15th
Big wad of money nuttin less than a twenty
Yo you want a five-oh the dope man gots plenty
To be a dope man boy you must qualify
Don't get high off your own supply
From a kid to a G it's all about money
10 piece for 10 base pipe comes free
If people out there are not hip 2 tha fact
If you see some one gettin' money 4 crack he's
Tha...

Dope man dope man
Hey man give me a hit
Dope man dope man
Yo man fuck that shit
Dope man dope man
We just can't quit
Dope man dope man
Well suck this bitch

(Dr dre)
Wait a minute who tha fuck are you talkin' 2 do you know who I am
Man I can't believe this shit this bitch iz tryin' 2 gank me
I'll slap you up side yo head wit 9 inches of limp dick

(Ice Cube)
You need a nigga wit money so you get a dope man
Juice that fool 4 has much as you can
She likes his car and he gets wit her
Got a black eye 'cause tha dope man hit her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind
Find that he's slapping you all tha time
That's ok 'cause he'z so rich and you ain't
Nuttin but tha dope man'z bitch do what he say and
U keep yo mouth shut poppin' that trash
Might get you fucked up you'll sit and cry
If tha dope man strikes you he don't give a fuck
He gots 2 just like you
There's a another girl in tha dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife
She's called strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry strawberry iz tha neighborhood ho
Do any thing for a hit or 2 give tha bitch a rock
She'll fuck the whole damn crew
It might be yo wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on tha dopeman's dick
Strawberry just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around she'll give you ghonnorhea
If people out there ain't hip to the fact
Strawberry iz a girl selling pussy 4 crack

Dope man dope man
Hey man give me a hit
Dope man dope man
Hey yo man fuck that shit
Dope man dope man
In yo face
Hey yo dre kick in tha bass
Icecube (lastverse)
If you smoke 'cane you'e a stupid motherfucka...
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucka
Doin' that crack with all the money ya got
On yo hands and knees searchin for a piece of rock
Jonzing for a hit and you looking for more
Doug stole a Alpine of out Eazy's 6-4
You need yo ass whooped 'cause it's out of this earth
Can't get a 10 piece need a dolla fifty's worth
Knucklehead nigga yeah you turned into a crook
But swear up and down boy that you ain't hooked
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long
'Cause he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone
You robbin and stealin', bugging and illin'
While the dope man's dealing
What is killin' your pain, cocaine, this shit's insane
Yo, E, she's a berry lets run a train

(Eazy E)
Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch

(Dre)
Me niether Ho go home and wash out yo beaver
And niggas out there messing up people's health
Yo what the fuck yo gotta say for yourself

Eazy e (as dopeman)
Well I'm the dopeman yeah boy wear coduoroy
Money up to here but unemployed
You keep smoking that rock and my pocket's getting bigger...

(Dre)
Yo, got that five-0 double up nigga

(Eazy)
Yeah high rollin' big money I'm foldin
Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holdin'

Ho you want a hit you gotta get your knees dirty
Well that's my life that how it's cut

(Girls)
