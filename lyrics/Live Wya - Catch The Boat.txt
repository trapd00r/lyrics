Rainy days in my city
But we working
I hope you’re working
Look…

I’m a loner, I’m a stoner
Weed residue on my PS2 controller
Blunt roller, lime juice and club soda
’til I’m sober, hung over
Like a choker, keep my finger on the pulse of the culture
Twelve AM, media noche
Out-of-towners go to Ultra
Catch me posted, cuban coffee, Calle Ocho
Fuck your party, I’m a no-show, antisocial, that’s a fo-sho
Bow down like you’re about to step on the mat at the dojo
Headshots, Grassy Knoll flow
This SoFlo
Uh, more lines than a Miami boat load
Tell my kids how their grandfather crossed shark infested waters
Landed at the harbor, years later had Arthur

I’m here baby
When I’m gone, my name’ll live on but for now
I’m here baby
I’m here baby
When I’m gone, my name’ll live on but for now
I’m here baby
It ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you’re at
It ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you’re at
I take where I’m from to where I’m at
I take where I’m from to where I’m at

This is the wave
On my surfboard on a tidal wave, I just wave
Misbehave, nowadays I just disengage
What can I say? This is the way they done paved
Birthday cake isn’t my fave
I don’t smoke blunts no more
I buddha vape in my Dead Pool cape
I work tomorrow, why am I up late?
Middle fingers up in your face if you relate
I don’t need no mosquitos in my air space
If I need to get to heaven then I’ll take the staircase
I feel like a fox trapped in a bear’s cage
I’ll cock slap all of y’all for that spare change
I’m a clown drinking a Smirnoff
Walking around with half his face smeared off
I’m Holyfield with his ear off
I’m Carl Malone and Post Malone playing beer pong
I’m on more songs than I appear on
I’m a stoner, boner pill popper
Whore hoarder, cocaine snow boarder
You can be my fucking show’s door holder
My balls drag longer as I grow older, hold up

I’m here baby
When I’m gone, my name’ll live on but for now
I’m here baby
I’m here baby
When I’m gone, my name’ll live on but for now
I’m here baby
It ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you’re at (Miami)
It ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you’re at (Miami)
I take where I’m from to where I’m at (Miami)
I take where I’m from to where I’m at (The county of Dade)
