I’ve got a secret I’m dying to tell you
You’re sound asleep, I don’t want to wake you
I’m about to break your heart and you don’t know
You don’t know

I’ve got my suitcase, it’s locked and loaded
Just in case you haven’t noticed
I’m about to break your heart or so I hope
So I hope

Ten steps from your bed to your door
Ten steps and I’ll see you no more
I’ve tried and I can’t cry tonight
I’ve tried and I can’t cry tonight

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

You look sweet like when I first saw you
Heaven knows how I once adored you
I’m about to kiss your mouth one last time

But no dream under your eyelashes
Could ever prepare you for this
I’m about to break your heart
Like you broke mine


Ten steps from your bed to your door
Ten steps and I’ll see you no more
I’ve tried and I can’t cry tonight
I’ve tried and I can’t cry tonight

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Ten steps from your bed to your door
Ten steps and I’ll see you no more
I’ve tried and I can’t cry tonight
I’ve tried and I can’t cry tonight
Five steps from your door to my car
Tiptoeing across your front yard
Don’t move, you stay right where you are
