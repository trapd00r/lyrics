Baby get close to me,
Read another story,
You got golden books for times like these,
To stop me from crying,

Baby get close to me,
Its time for a feeding,
Take your blouse so slowly,

I wanna touch, my head to your soft pillow
And if you ever give me the chance,
I'm never letting go,
If this ain't bout pleasing me,
Why you releasing me,
Why why whoa

Baby don't give up on me,
Your skin on mine feels lovely,
And the trust it comes so naturally,
Except when you have gone away,

But when your here I sense you're near,
I feel your overarching care,
Teach me to feel you everywhere,
I wanna feel you everywhere,

I wanna feel you everywhere,
I wanna feel you everywhere,
I wanna feel you everywhere,

I wanna touch, my head to your soft pillow,
And if you ever give me the chance,
I'm never letting go,
If this ain't bout pleasing me,
Why you releasing me,

Baby don't give up on me,
Experience comes slowly,
How optimistic can you be,
To wait for things you cannot see
