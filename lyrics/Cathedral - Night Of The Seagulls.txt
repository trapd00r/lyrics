We are the blind dead 
No eyes inside our head 
Our senses lead us to your nightmare 
Centuries of death we wear 
Pharaoh's cross in dust we bare 
Immortal horses slowly ride us to you 

Through the black mist 
They ride 
Knights templar - arise 

The shores unearthly dead 
Mournful mothers chilled with dread 
Leave their offspring to knights templar
They rise from the sea 
At midnight the prize you see 
Tied to the post - a virgin screaming 

Through the black mist 
They ride 
Knights templar - arise - oh!!! 

Into our castle led 
Seagulls howling overhead 
The ritual you face 
You shall no after 
Your blood we drink for eternity 
Flesh unto the crabs we leave
And feed your heart unto Aquarian master 

Through the black mist 
They ride 
Knights templar - arise
