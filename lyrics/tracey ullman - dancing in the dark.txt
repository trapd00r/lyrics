Hey

Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
It's the place that we meet
We can jump to the beat
Everybody, go dancing at the club
Friday night is here and everything is fine
We'll be going downtown to have a good time
Dancing's fun with everyone
Dancing close is the thing I like the most
Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Get up, up on your feet
Come on jump to the beat
Everybody go dancing at the club
You spend your money on the clothes you wear
You spend your time on how you stile your hair
But at the club you haven't got a care
You feel so good, it's just because you're there, hey

So if you're tiered of work and can't stand the heat
Go down to the sound that's moving your feet
Dancing's fun with everyone
Dancing close is the thing you like the most
Go dancing, go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Come on in from the street
You can jump to the beat
Everybody go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
It's the place that we meet
We can jump to the beat
Everybody go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Get up, up on your feet
Come on jump to the beat
Everybody go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Come on jump to the beat
Everybody, go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
