[Verse 1]

I was sittin' at home
Thinkin' to myself
I started thinkin' bout you
How much I do love you
I really do
I would never trade you
Never forsake you
cause nothin' could be better
That's why I wrote you this letter
I love you always lady

[Chorus]

Last Night
I wrote a short letter
And it went this way
Dear baby I love you just thinkin' of you
Love always
(repeat)

[Verse2]

Now I know I could've called
But it seemed much better this way
Cause I'm missin' my baby
I'm so blessed your my lady lady
Now I know I can't wait till tomorrow
When your in my arms again
Holdin' and kissin' you doin' thing thing we love to do
But till then

[Chorus]

Last Night
I wrote a short letter
And it went this way
Dear baby I love you just thinkin' of you
Love always
(repeat)

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo,....

[repeat chorus 4X]

Oh baby I love you, I love you, I love you,
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
Just to prove that I really, really love you
Baby I want you, I want you, I want you
And there's nothing that I'd rather do
Than to love you..... I love you always
Every night and every day.
