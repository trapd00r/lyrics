Remembering me
Discover and see
All over the world
She's known as a girl

To those who are free
The mind shall be key
Forgotten as the past
Cause history will last

------------------------------

Refrain:
God is a girl
Wherever you are
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
Whatever you say
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
However you live
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
She's only a girl
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

---------------------------

She wants to shine
Forever in time
She is so driven
She's always mine

Clearly and free
She wanted to be
A part of the future
A girl like me

There is a sky illuminating us
Someone is out there that we truly trust
There is a rainbow for you and me
A beautiful sunrise eternaly
