I can see it in your eyes 
No more tears no allabies 
I'm still in love with you 
There's so much I gotta show 
I will never let you go 
but still i know for sure 
Come take me by the hand 
This summer never end 

*Chorus* 
And I wanna know 
That you believe in love again 
Please tell me now its not the end 
Cause this i promise you so true 
This summer belongs to you 
but you believe in love again 
How can I make you understand 
but this i promise you so true 
This summer belongs to you 

This summer belongs to you 

Would you catch me if i fall 
Crash and burn and lose it all 
Tell me what to do 
Cause i need you night and day 
Will you ever run away 
Just one more thing to say 
Come take me by the hand 
This summer never end 

*Chorus* 
And I wanna know 
That you believe in love again 
Please tell me know its not the end 
Cause this i promise you so true 
This summer belongs to you 
but you believe in love again 
How can i make you understand 
but this i promise you so true 
This summer belongs to you 

This summer belongs to you
