Living on a diet of Chocolates and Cigarettes
I wanna call you again
Ill drink tea sometimes when its cold
This is getting old
I call you again

Still too young to fail, too scared to sail away
But one of these days Ill grow old
And Ill grow brave and I'll go
One of these days

Blowing out the candles from my cake
I choke on the smoke as I look around the room
Everybodys wishing for no more mistakes
And all that I can think about is you

Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
But one of these days Ill grow old
And Ill grow brave and I'll go
One of these days
La da la da la da

Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
But one of these days Ill grow old
And Ill grow brave and I'll go
One of these days
La da la da la da
