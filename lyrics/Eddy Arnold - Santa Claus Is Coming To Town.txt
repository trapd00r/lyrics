Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's a making a list, checking in twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out you better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

With a little tin horn and a little toy drums
A root a toot toot and a rum a tum tums
Santa Claus is coming to town

And curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is coming to town

The kids and girls in boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland town
All around the Christmas tree

Oh, you better watch out you better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
