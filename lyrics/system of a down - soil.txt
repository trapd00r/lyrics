The phoenix, he helped create
Out of control, boy without a dad
Shot the gun that startled my life
While I drove him with a forty-five

Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, dreams, insecurity
Men fall unrealized
Unrealized, unrealized

Making a decision of death
While everyone around you plead
Now you fly in peace
I hope, my friend
A man can't avoid what he's meant to do
When he's meant to do it
Even if he doesn't really want to

My memories are of fun and friendship
Of weakness within the strength of youth
For reasons undefined, reasons undefined
Reasons undefined, reasons undefined

Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, dreams, insecurity
Your men fall unrealized

Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in the skin

Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil
Lives in a motherfucking skin

Why the fuck did you take him away from us?
You motherfucker!
