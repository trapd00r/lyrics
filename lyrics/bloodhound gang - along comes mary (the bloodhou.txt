Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me 
And every now and then, I spend my time at rhyme and verse and curse those faults In me

And then along comes Mary 
Mary, Mary 
Then along comes Mary 
Mary, Mary 

And does she want to give me kicks and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories? 
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees? 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 
Sweet as the punch 

When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play 
And when the masquerade is played and neighbour folks make jokes as who is most to blame today 

And then along comes Mary 
Mary, Mary 
Then along comes Mary 
Mary, Mary 

And does she want to set them free and let them see reality from where she got her name? 
And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch of hers will make them not the same? 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 
Sweet as the punch 

And when the morning of the warning's passed, the gassed and flaccid kids are flung across the stars 
The psychodramas and the traumas gone, the songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars 

And then along comes Mary 
Mary, Mary 
Then along comes Mary 
Mary, Mary 

And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains she left the night before? 
Or will their wakin' eyes reflect the lies and make them realize their urgent cry for sight no more? 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 
Sweet as the punch 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 

When we met, I was sure out to lunch 
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch 
Sweet as the punch
