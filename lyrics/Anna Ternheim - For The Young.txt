Anyone in there?
Knock, knock, knock
I think I see you among the shadows
They still cling to the wall
And your mind feeds them
You're the victim of lack of meaning
Feeling sorry is your favorite feeling

Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
Give me a reason to lay down my guns
Who said youth is only for the young

You shut out the light in your home
All that remains is the echo of laughter
Someone left it there a half lifetime ago

Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
Give me a reason to lay down my guns
Who said youth is

Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
Give me a reason to lay down my guns
Who said youth is only for the young

Why am I supposed to excuse you
Nod my head as if I'm amused
You never gave up, you never begun
Who said youth is only for the young
