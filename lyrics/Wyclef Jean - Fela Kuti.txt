"Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the sexiest one of the all?"
He replied, "Girl, you are
A shooting star"
I can see through the dust
You're my diamond in the rough
Can't nobody get to us
We real and they faking the love
And we found our way
Out of the maze
From walking the block to running from cops
Now we shower in [?]

To buy you a ring
And we go back to Vegas
What happened in Vegas we don't gotta say
