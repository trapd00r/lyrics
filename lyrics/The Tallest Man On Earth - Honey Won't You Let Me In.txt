Now the snow will fall and the lover's call
Will be drenched out by the shatterin' of verse
As the seasons shift, lonely minds will drift
On the ocean in a build above its lore

As I knock your door from inside once more
How I wish a soothin' breeze would let me in
Shake my tambourine at your glowing dreams
So honey, won't you let me in, oh

As we cease to know where our fate will go
We won't see the rivers tied up in the vines
Branches will untie every mumblin' lie
Every frayed word in your lullaby is heard

Oh, when I catch the thorns of our first divorce
How I wish the turning sunset could record
Blow my engine steam at your glowin' dreams
So honey, won't you let me in, oh

Now the dust will rise, dress the open skies
Just a gallery of words we've used too much
It's a feather's weight but what if it's too late
To be building up our muscles in the draft

Put me on the mornin' ship and I will take the trip
To return with all the treasures of the past
It will always seem like a glowin' dream
So honey, won't you let me in
I said honey, won't you let me in, oh
