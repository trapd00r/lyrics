Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh-hoo, ooohooo

I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there

Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this, oh

Would you tell me I was wrong, would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me, are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back

Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohoho

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Ohoho, it's dangerous, it's so out of line
To try to turn back time

I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
