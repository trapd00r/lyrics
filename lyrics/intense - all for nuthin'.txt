All Or Nothing (Overland/Goldsworthy/Jupp/Barnett)
I still remember all the promises we made
This bond between us will never fade away
We ain't got much and that's no lie
But we got something money can't buy
We got each other, that's all we need
Maybe we're crazy, chasing a dream
When the sun goes down we gotta leave this place
Disappear without a trace
'Cos it's all or nothing
It's now or never, it's make or break
All or nothing
It's a chance we gotta take
Leave no clues, leave no tracks
Keep on running, don't look back
Trust in me, I'll always be there
When you need a friend, somebody who cares
Lean on me, I won't let you down
I know nothing's gonna stop us now
When the sun goes down we gotta leave this place
Disappear without a trace
'Cos it's all or nothing
It's now or never, it's make or break
All or nothing
It's a chance we gotta take
Two souls loving on the run
Two hearts that beat as one tonight
Don't give in, never say die
Just call my name
I'll be by your side
Lean on me, I won't let you down
I know nothing's gonna stop us now
All or nothing
All or nothing
Ask yourself do you believe in fate
All or nothing
It's a chance we gotta take
