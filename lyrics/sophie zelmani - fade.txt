Fade you star
Fade from my heaven
Fade for the promise
Of forgetting
If I stared and you'd
Be shining through
I would probably still see you

Farewell my guest
You were the only one
Who saw the door
Might be open
If I only could have
Told you then
That the lock just was broken

There was no place
There was no time
There was no place
There was no time
