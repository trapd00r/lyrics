Faded dreams and blue jeans,
A Rangers cap with sweat rings,
There's a hole in the sole of my favorite boots.
Well I've been at it a long time
Working on that bottom line
And every shirt I've worn,
The collar's been blue.
One of these days I'm gonna jump right off that shelf
And hit the ground runnin'-
At least that's what I keep telling myself.

I've been sittin' on the fence for way too long
Warming that bench as chance moves on
And believe me, that ain't no way to live.
And this barely gettin' by is really gettin' old
And it's hard to turn a wrench on a rusty bolt
But someday something's gotta give.

Busted hands and broken land,
And black gold turned to sand,
The whiskey's the only well that's running deep.
Yeah the dust devils dancin' on the mesa again
At the mercy of that west Texas wind,
And the tumbleweeds, well, they seem to know more than me.
Yeah they always find their way right out of town
They never turn back,
They keep on rollin' and they don't slow down.

I've been sittin' on the fence for way too long
Warming that bench as chance moves on
And believe me, that ain' no way to live.
And this barely gettin' by is really gettin' old
And it's hard to turn a wrench on a rusty bolt
But someday something's gotta give.

Ooh, I've been sittin' on the fence for way too long
Warming that bench as chance moves on
And believe me, that ain' no way to live.
And this barely gettin' by is really gettin' old
And it's hard to turn a wrench on a rusty bolt
But someday something's gotta give.

Man, I've been sittin' on the fence for way too long
Warming that bench as chance moves on
And believe me, no that ain' no way to live.
And this barely gettin' by is really gettin' old
And it's hard to turn a wrench on a rusty bolt
But someday something's gotta give.
Something's gotta give.
