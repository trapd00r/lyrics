I'm not threatened by every pair of legs you watch go by
I don't cringe when you stare at women it's just a thing called guy
I don't notice your sideways glances or where your loyalty lies
I'm secure and out of me it's hard to get a rise

I'm not jealous
I don't get moved by much
I'm not enraged
Not insecure as such
Not going insane
Rational stays in touch
Doth I protest too much

I'm not tortured by how oft you're busy 'cause I've got things to do
I'm not disappointed about how you don't miss me 'cause I don't need you to

I'm not needy
I don't get clingy much
I am not scared
I'm not afraid as such
I'm not dependent
Rock solid stays in touch
Doth I protest too much

So much energy to prove to you who I can't possibly be
So much energy to prove to you I'm not who you hate for me to be

I'm not saddened and I don't miss you 'cause I have moved on too
I'm not concerned about your new lover 'cause I've a new lover too

I'm not depressed
I don't get down that much
I'm not despondent
I am not dark as such
I'm never sad
Keep chin up stays in touch
Doth I protest too much
