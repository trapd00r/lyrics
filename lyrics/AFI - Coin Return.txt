I have slipped, I have fallen
So far down I can't get out
Overwhelmed by my doubt

Things I said I'd never do, I've done
Those I said I'd never be, I've become

I have broken, I'm still breaking
Cracked and wrecked, beyond repair
I can see that no one cares

Things I said I'd never do, I've done
Those I said I'd never be, I've become

Things I said I'd never do, I've done
Those I said I'd never be, I've become

Smacks me in my face every time I fall
I cannot disregard
With each new fall, I hit twice as hard

I cannot disregard
With each new fall, I hit twice as hard
I cannot disregard
With each new fall, I hit twice as hard

With each new fall, I hit twice as hard
Would you be there for me? I would
I would be there for you, I would
Would you look up to see? I would
Falling forward and looking up
