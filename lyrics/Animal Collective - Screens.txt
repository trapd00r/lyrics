If I could take my eyes away it might not get so dark out 
If I could keep my hands out it might not feel so dry out 
And when I would feel I'd know that it was real 

I'd like to stay with natural things organic as my skin that peels 
And not so often enter in to outer space that I can never 
Touch backlit and bite 
Fields in a mine to turn it off and to make sure 
I keep it real with myself and never let obsessions with conncections to an outside source 
Be crippling my abilities to breath and take a step out from my usual places 
Just to make sure I keep it real with my own and never let a tendency to tread in water with no target 
Cripple my abilities to do the thing that needs be done  
Why am I seeing screens? 
I feel a screen I think I'm lost in so many screens that I am seeing screens appear behind my eyes 
But I feel a screen what am I lost in so many screens that I am seeing screens appear behind my eyes 
Why am I seeing screens? Why am I before screens?
