Took my chances carelessly
Choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby
But you ain't seen the worst yet

Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead
Who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one

And I ain't standing, never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love

Wrote my changes helplessly
Yeah but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
So I booked with all the bets

Living like a lemon ain't so hot
And you ain't my idea
Of one high-rollin' shot

No I ain't standing, never standing

Big dark clouds hanging over your head
Hope you've heard, baby all I've said
You've been told, what I've said
No use crying, you're as good as dead

Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
And the woman who is dead, who is out all right
Now I'm not the only one

And I ain't standing, never standing
