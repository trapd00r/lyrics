Behold, the eighth wonder of the natural world!
Come one and come all, see the two-headed girl.
Stupendous! Revolting!
You’ll be shocked, you’ll be awed!
A true freak of nature, a blunder of God!
But possessing such talents,
Hear them sing, see them dance.
As seen in the highest class parlors of France.
Just ten bucks a photograph,
Get your seats while they last.
We take Visa and MasterCard, debit or cash.

Isn’t it nice that they’re being so nice to us?
If I’m not mistaken I think they might like us.
Aren’t we lucky to be here?
Stop moving, they’re taking a picture.
Smile for the camera, Evelyn.

Come in, come in, must be cold out there gentlemen.
Take off your coats, and just guess what the wind blew in.
I know you like twins, have I got a surprise,
They’re identical sisters attached at the side.
Just imagine the fun you could have with these chicklets,
And they’re so well-behaved, not a single complaint yet.
Just look at these photographs, while I pour you a cocktail,
I don’t know whether I should charge double or triple!

Ladies and gentlemen, critics and hipsters,
Have you heard the new disc by the Evelyn sisters?
Seamlessly floating with grace between eras and genres,
They sing timeless new songs, rife with double entendres.
As featured in Rolling Stone, Spin, The New Yorker and Pitchfork,
There’s an in-store appearance today at the corner,
Of Bedford and Seventh Ave., some get a photograph, sticker and autographed shirt.
