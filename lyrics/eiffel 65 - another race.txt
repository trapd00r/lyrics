It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away

It's another race
It's another race

They seem to walk on air
And they act pretty strange
They live around us
But you can't recognize them
We can't communicate
With their one-way brain
No matter how you try
You just can't understand them (them, them, them...)

It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away

It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away

They seem to walk on air
And they act pretty strange
They live around us
But you can't recognize them
We can't communicate
With their one-way brain
No matter how you try
You just can't understand them (them, them, them...)

It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away

It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away

And they think they've got it made
And they're right, but they're wrong
And they try to use our words
But it's a lie...

It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away

It's another race from outer space
It's another race away, away
It's another race from outer space
It's another race away
