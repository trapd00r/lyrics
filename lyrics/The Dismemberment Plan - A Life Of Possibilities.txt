You dig down underground now 
Through the soil, through the cooling clay 
As the din fades above you 
You're moving 
You're secret 
You're nowhere 
It's all good 

And no lights lead you onwards 
No signs point you on your way 
You're just earth in all directions 
It's endless 
It's mapless 
No compass 
No north star 

You're all gone 'cause they can't find you 
You're lost 'cause they don't know the way 
They blame themselves, they blame each other 
They're angry 
They're sorry 
They're worried 
You don't care 

The shovels scrape somewhere up there 
They just want to know if you're okay
Morse code tapped with hammers 
You hear it 
You know it 
Ignore it 
You're on your way 

Oh, but some point, oh, you've got to come up for air 
You wipe the rocks and mud and dirt out of your hair 
You're blind and queasy with a growing sense of despair 
You don't know anyone 

You look around trying to find someone you know 
You put your hand up in the air, you kinda wave hello 
But if they do care, oh, they're not letting it show 
This can't be new to you 

There's a feeling coming back, connected by one thread 
It's pulling at your hands like a spider web 
Like a kite that isn't there

If it's a life of possibilities that pulls you away 
That claws and tears and challenges you to stay, well, then 
If it's a life of possibilities that you've got to live 
Then don't be surprised when they don't remember you 
Or simply don't want to, yeah yeah yeah
