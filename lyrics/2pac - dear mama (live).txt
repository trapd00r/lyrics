When I was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin' from the police that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama 
You always was a black queen mama 
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand.

You are appreciated.

Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin' 
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin' home after work, late
Your in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Just workin' with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, your alone
Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.

You are appreciated.

Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (And dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I got to thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.

You are appreciated.

Sweet lady. Lady. Lady. Lady.
