Polly wants a cracker
Think I should get off her first
Think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, you have been told
Promise you, I have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, you have been told
Promise you, I have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct

Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, you have been told
Promise you, I have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
