Want you back in my life

I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
'Cause that's where you belong
And I, I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong

I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
'Cause that's where you belong
And I, I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong

Look at me standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
Calling out your name again
Look at me standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
Calling out your name again

Remeber when you told me you
You didn't want anybody else but me
Well I'm that same girl is all you need to see

I want you back in my life
Want you back by my side
'Cause that's where you belong
And I, I won't give you up
I will never stop
My love is much too strong

Look at me standing here
Crying out my final tears
Look at me in the rain
Calling out your name again
