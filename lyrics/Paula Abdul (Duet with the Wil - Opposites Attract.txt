I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it 
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it 
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool 
With my homegirl, Paula Abdul 

Baby seems we never ever agree 
You like the movies 
And I like T.V. 
I take things serious 
And you take 'em light 
I go to bed early 
And I party all night 

Our friends are sayin' 
We ain't gonna last 
Cuz I move slowly 
And baby I'm fast 

I like it quiet 
And I love to shout 
But when we get together 
It just all works out 

[Chorus:] 
I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 

Who'd a thought we could be lovers 
She makes the bed 
And he steals the covers 

She likes it neat 
And he makes a mess 
I take it easy 
Baby I get obsessed 
She's got the money 
And he's always broke 
I don't like cigarettes 
And I like to smoke 

Things in common 
Just ain't a one 
But when we get together 
We have nothin' but fun 

I take--2 steps forward 
I take--2 steps back 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 
And you know--it ain't fiction 
Just a natural fact 
We come together 
Cuz opposites attract 

[Repeat Chorus]

Baby ain't it somethin' 
How we lasted this long 
You and me 
Provin' everyone wrong 
Don't think we'll ever 
Get our differences patched 

Don't really matter 
Cuz we're perfectly matched 

[Repeat Chorus Twice]

[Sung in the "ShutUp & Dance" version and in the "Opposites Attract" Music Video]

Nothing in common but this trust 
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus 
One going up, one coming down 
But we seem to land on common ground 

When things go wrong we make corrections 
To keep things moving in the right direction 
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack 
Its true- this- Opposites Attract
