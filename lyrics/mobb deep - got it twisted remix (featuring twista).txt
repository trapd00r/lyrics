A-a-alchemist
Yeah, once again and we have the remix
Yeah, uh, huh, what we got?
Twista, I see you, my nigga, c'mon now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, huh, go, go

Ain't no party, once we crash the party
Shorty, I'm only here for one night
Meet me in the lobby, take a sip of this get nice
I'ma get you bent but fuck it, it's only right

The martinis, them Belvy's, the Hypnotiq's
Turned you out, wanna see what's up in your closet
You got a man, that's cool, I just wanna be friends
I ain't tryin' to get hooked like phonics

We on the low, so, you won't be spotted
Front window tinted, so, you safe in the cockpit
Fools wild in the club, I just play the wall
My niggaz pray and pray for my downfall

Man, how I scoop them broads and get that groupie love
One look and your chick is dug
Y'all ain't real, y'all some home thugs
Please don't make me show you what I snuck in the club, yeah

Y'all niggaz got it twisted, huh?
That liquor up in you, you charged
That truth come out when you drunk
Yo' ass won't make it to see tomorrow

Y'all niggaz got it twisted, huh?
That liquor up in you, you charged
That truth come out when you drunk
Yo' ass won't make it to see tomorrow

We step up in the club with one thing
On our mind, that's leave with something
Get rid of that ring, get rid of those cuffs
We about the girl

We about the girl
We about the girl, girl
We about the girl
We about the girl, girl

They call me Twista but homey don't get it twisted
Fuck specifics, or the ballistics hollows'll get you rifted
Fuck with the gifted, take a look at what my machines did
That I got from my niggaz from Queensbridge, you ain't seen shit

Take a shot of my liquor, then I pull on the trigger
Rollin' in with the Mobb Deep, and we steady gettin' thicker and thicker
For the lords and the gangsters, thugs and the killers
We got too many toolies floatin' between us, you can't get wit us

It's that killer Twista in the house and I'm
Quick to put the pistol in your mouth and uh
Got pounds like got seventy-five to cop twenty
But I'm only spendin' sixty, the rest is new glock money

Distribute 'em to the click that we steppin' up in the club
Where the freaks pop that ass on the dick, showin' us love
Tryin' to get out of line, you gon' get hit with the biscuit
You got Seagram's in front of you, so get twisted, don't get it twisted

Y'all niggaz got it twisted, huh?
That liquor up in you, you charged
That truth come out when you drunk
Yo' ass won't make it to see tomorrow

Y'all niggaz got it twisted, huh?
That liquor up in you, you charged
That truth come out when you drunk
Yo' ass won't make it to see tomorrow

We step up in the club with one thing
On our mind, that's leave with something
Get rid of that ring, get rid of those cuffs
We about the girl

We about the girl
We about the girl, girl
We about the girl
We about the girl, girl

If you really wanna party with P
Put your hands where my eyes can see
And shorty, right there, she come with me
And I hope she got friends 'cause we Mobb Deep

No bullshit, Timb boots and gangster clothes
We don't follow trends, we set those
You see us gettin' dressed up, ain't nuttin'
But some fresh white on whites and that ol' folks

Infamous a new label
Don't confuse our shit with no other labels
Come through that bitch just force and lay shit down
We don't gotta send people, we bang for real

You won't know if I did sum'n, I won't tell
Or rap about it songs 'cause that's goin' to jail
But come fuckin' with me, that's goin' to hell
You rap about me? That's how I can tell

Y'all niggaz got it twisted, huh?
That liquor up in you, you charged
That truth come out when you drunk
Yo' ass won't make it to see tomorrow

Y'all niggaz got it twisted, huh?
That liquor up in you, you charged
That truth come out when you drunk
Yo' ass won't make it to see tomorrow

We step up in the club with one thing
On our mind, that's leave with something
Get rid of that ring, get rid of those cuffs
We about the girl

We about the girl
We about the girl, girl
We about the girl
We about the girl, girl
