1. In land of darkness, where shadows are living
Rose has grown...

It's petals are lightened by wintermoon
Mourn, newborn...

Brilliant starlight reflecting from flower
Shining around...

Snow-white petals are so look like
Burial gown...

- Now die, you won't survive.

- Never! I fight, I am still alive...

2. Keeper of darkness, the silent harvester
With name not to be said...

Looks on a rose, and the time before time
Reminds him his maid...

When gods were young and thought never of death
When new world was born...

His maid was slain by a demon of chaos,
First living fall...

- Silent tears fall in the winternight.

- Only Moon and the stars shining brilliantly bright.
