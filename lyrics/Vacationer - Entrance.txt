[Verse 1]
Hidden message in a common trait
Begs repeating more than most things
In and out, out and in I breathe for the life
Closer to it than I’ve ever been
More tremendous than I have seen
I want it all, all to come home with me for the ride

[Chorus]
It could take a whole turn
All in a moment’s time
Everyone comes to learn
All in a moment

[Verse 2]
Heaven’s entrance and I’m on the verge
Of heading through it with no concern
I want to know how to keep this place in my eyes
Closer to it than I’ve ever been
Closer to it than I’ve ever been
I am closer to it than I’ve ever been in my life

[Chorus]
It could take a whole turn
All in a moment’s time
Everyone comes to learn
All in a moment’s time
It could take a whole turn
All in a moment’s time
Everyone comes to learn
All in a moment’s time

[Bridge]
Is it that which can’t begin?
Or that which has no end?
They both could be the case
That lucid dreams could never replace

[Outro]
Hey, Hey, Hey
Whoa-ah-ah
Whoa-ah-ah
Whoa-ah-ah
