You know, the night-time (wah-do-day),
Oh, is the right time (wah-do-day)
To be (wah-do-day)
With the one you love (wah-do-day).
I said the night-time (wah-do-day),
Oh, is the right time (wah-do-day)
To be (wah-do-day)
With the one you love (wah-do-day).
I said the night-time (wah-do-day),
Oh, is the right time (wah-do-day)
To be with the one you love
(Wah-do-day, wah-do-day).

"Baby (wah-do-day),"
I said, "A-baby (wah-do-day),
Baby (wah-do-day),
Come on, and drive me crazy, Lord (wah-do-day).
You know, I love you (wah-do-day),
Always thinkin' of you (wah-do-day)."
"Hey, baby (wah-do-day),"
Oh, I said, "A-baby (wah-do-day),
You know, the night-time (wah-do-day)
Oh, is the right time (wah-do-day)
To be with the one you love
(Wah-do-day, wah-do-day)."
Alright, sing a song!

I said the night-time (wah-do-day),
Oh, is the right time (wah-do-day)
To be (wah-do-day)
With the one you love (wah-do-day).
I said the night-time (wah-do-day),
Oh, is the right time (wah-do-day)
To be (wah-do-day)
With the one you love (wah-do-day).
I said the night-time (wah-do-day),
Oh, is the right time (wah-do-day)
To be with the one you love.
