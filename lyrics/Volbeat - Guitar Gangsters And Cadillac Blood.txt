There's a Cadillac out in the dark
There's a guitar gangster lighting a smoke
And he feels the night, and he feels the fire

Driving into the city unknown
10 small houses is what he face in the cold
And he feels the night, can you feel the fire

Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood
They came from the road and out of the dark
Went into a place even darker
Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood

Walking into a place called The Bar
People looking like a ghost has arrived
And he feels the eyes, can you feel the eyes

Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood
They came from the road and out of the dark
Went into a place even darker
Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood

Dear ladies,gentlemen, don't be afraid
We are here to ease your pain
Let it all start with a song
I'm sure we'll get along

Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood
They came from the road and out of the dark
Went into a place even darker
Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood
