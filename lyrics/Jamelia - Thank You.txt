Thankyou

oh oh no oh yea yea

(Verse 1:)
The fights, those nights
I tried to pretend it don't hurt
The way, I prayed
Someday that you would love me
Really, completely
Just how I wanted it to be
But no, so wrong
Can't believe I stayed with you so long

(B-Chorus:)
You hit, you spit, you split, ever-y bit of me, yeah
You stole, you broke, you're cold
You're such a joke to me, yeah

(Chorus:)
For every last bruise you gave me
For every time I sat in tears
For the million ways you hurt me
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you
Messed up my dreams, made me strong
Thank you

(Verse 2:)
My head, near dead
Just the way you want it
My soul, stone cold
Cos I was under you're control 
So young, so dumb
Knew just how to make me succum
But I un-derstand
To make yourself feel like a man

(B-Chorus:)
You hit, you spit, you split, ever-y bit of me, yeah
You stole, you broke, you're cold
You're such a joke to me, yeah
thankyou

(Chorus:)
For every last bruise you gave me
For every time I sat in tears 
For the million ways you hurt me
I just wanna tell you this
You broke my world, made me strong
Thank you
Messed up my dreams, made me strong
Thank you

(Middle eight:)
You coulda had it all babe
It coulda been so right (so right)
I woulda given you everything (everything)
Morning through night
Yeah, you taught me some lessons (lessons)
Those are my blessings (blessings)
That wont happen again (again) 
Thank you

(chorus till end)
