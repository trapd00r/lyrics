Do you dare
'Cause if you do
Do you dare
I just wanna know

Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Do you dare
'Cause if you do
I'll take you there
Do you dare

What's holding you back
(Can you feel it)
(Can you feel it)
What's holding you back
(Can you feel it)
(Can you feel it)
I just wanna know

Do you dare
'Cause if you do
I'll take you there
Do you dare

Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Do you dare
'Cause if you do
I'll take you there
Do you dare

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
