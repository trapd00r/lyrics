But now we're coming full circle
Riding the airplanes
Only the best things
Are good enough for you baby

As a matter of fact
I wish I knew I'm good enough for your love

Somebody told me that
I gotta leave it alone
That there ain't a reason to be fixing what isn't broke
I gotta leave it in the attic
Leave it under cover

You love me but you don't even know what you do to me
And I try to let ya go but it's ecstasy
I'd pull away if I could but you're good for me
And I don't wanna lose you cause

You love me but you don't even know what you do to me
And I try to think it through but it's fantasy
I'd pull away if I could but you're good for me
And I don't wanna lose you cause

You love me you love me yeah
You love me you love me

And we don't need to talk it through again
I know what I know
If I ever said it then I meant it, let go
Leave it alone

But you love me, but you don't even know what you do to me
And I try to let go, but it's ecstasy
And you pull me away just like ya won me
And I don't wanna lose you cause

You love me but you don't even know what you do to me
And I try to think it through but it's fantasy
I'd pull away if I could but you're good for me
And I don't wanna lose you cause
You love me

Every - one lies to me
I know you wouldn't lie to me
I know you wouldn't lie to me
I know you wouldn't lie
I know you wouldn't lie

Every - one lies to me
I know you wouldn't lie to me
I know you wouldn't lie to me
I know you wouldn't lie
I know you wouldn't lie

You love me but you don't even know what you do to me
And I try to think it through but it's fantasy
I'd pull away if I could but you're good for me
And I don't wanna lose you cause

You love me but you don't even know what you do to me
And I try to think it through but it's fantasy
I'd pull away if I could but you're good for me
And I don't wanna lose you cause
You love me

You love me you love me yeah
You love me you love me
