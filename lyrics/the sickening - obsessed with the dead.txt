Once again I dreamed of rot
Macabre visions inside my bloody morgue
Rigidness... Rigor Mortis
I'm obsessed by dead bodies
I exhumed them for the autopsy
I just live for this moment

The surgeon mask covers my face
as I hold a jigsaw in my hand
Fascinated...by the loathsome
Crished heads...limbless torsos
Bloodstained...eyes of horror
My ecstasy is your sorrow

...Upon the rotting innards
...My forensic carnage
...The sickening Disembowelment
...Surgery for the dead

I unearthed the buried ones
for their morbid organs I lust
I desecrated those silent graves
Searching anatomical preys

...Upon the rotting innards
...My forensic carnage
...The sickening Disembowelment
...Surgery for the dead
