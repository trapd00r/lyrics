When I was a young man I'd never been kissed
I got to thinking about what I had missed
I found a girl. I kissed her and then...
Oh Lord, I kissed her again

Oh, kisses sweeter than wine
Oh, kisses sweeter than wine

He asked me to marry and be his sweet wife
We would be happy - all of our life
He begged and he pleaded like a natural man, and then...
Oh Lord, I gave him my hand

Oh, kisses sweeter than wine
Oh, kisses...

I worked mighty hard and so did my wife
Working hand in hand to make a good life
Corn in the field and wheat in the bins, and then...
Oh Lord, I was the father of twins

Oh, kisses sweeter than wine
Oh, kisses...

Our children numbered just about four
And they all had sweethearts knocking on the door
They all got married and they didn't wait, I was...
Oh Lord! A grandmother of eight!

Oh, kisses sweeter than wine
Oh, kisses...

Now we are old and ready to go
Thinking about what happened a long time ago

We had lots of kids and trouble and pain, but...
Oh Lord, we'd do it again

Oh, kisses sweeter than wine
Oh, kisses...
Oh, kisses sweeter than wine
Oh, kisses...
