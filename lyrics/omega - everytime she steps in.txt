Slowly the hours were creeping
Silence felt on my little room
I watched the door to open
Needed light, oh, instead of gloom
I heard the wind blow
And I was feeling low

Every time she steps in
All the world is bright and gay
Yes, she takes the silence
Makes it music in her way

Slowly the dawn is breaking
When we drowsly go to sleep
A nice tune we've heard many time is
Ringing on in our dream so deep
Now I'am not lonely
I'm happy as can be
