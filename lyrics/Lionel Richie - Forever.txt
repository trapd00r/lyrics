Don't know why we had an argument, all I know is that my baby left
Now I'm looking at a photograph thinking all about the time we spent
And I can't even begin to start you not here it tears me apart
But you gotta know that I need you
Girl I'm lost and don't know where to go to
(Girl I'm lost and don't know where to go to)

Girl I'm missing you, need you in my life
'Cause I thought we'd be in love for a long time
Even if you're gone, you'll be on my mind, forever and ever and ever
And ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever forever girl

I don't wanna hang out no more (if she ain't there)
Tell me what am I going for
If you ain't been in love (you won't understand)
And I don't wanna see you with another man (another man)
This is crazy, all you gotta do is come back
Baby if you want the world then I'll get that
Girl you know that I need you please tell me what I need to do
(Tell me what I need to do)

(Ooh)
Why I gotta keep going through changes
(Reason that I breathe)
You're the reason that I breathe
(Ooh)
Every girl to me is nothing but a stranger
(You're the one for me)
On the real you're the one for me
Tell me what I would be without your love, to be your friend is not enough
(Ooh) come back to me girl
