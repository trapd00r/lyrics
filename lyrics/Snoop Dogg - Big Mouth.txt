You know there is always some big mouth-ass motherfucker talkin' shit
There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'
Always a nigga hatin', there's always somebody that is displeased with what you do you can never make motherfuckers happy
There is always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled
There is always some bitch on the side line talkin' shit with her big mouth
There is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda do with your money and what you coulda or would or shoulda, it's just..
You understand me? Big Mouth with your big mouth ass!

You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)

A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not heard of it yet or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Cause I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass

You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

People used to say you got a big mouth
Now I understand what they're talking about
Because what we do is just between me and you
And that's something that you ran and tell your crew
But you had to told Sheran and she told Cara
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarah
Cara told Bibi and she told [?] talking to her mam
[?]
And somehow my nigga [?]
He told somebody new from town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn show is been changed around
And that's the reason why ain't fuck with you now
Cause you never shoulda open your mouth at all
And I wouldn't have no reason to make this call

You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

Now you're the dime dropper of the neighborhood
And everytime I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
