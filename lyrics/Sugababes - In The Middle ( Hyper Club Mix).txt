All:
I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh)
'Cause everybody's making trouble
Someone's burst their bubble
But we'll be getting by all right (uh uh uh)

Mutya:
Sooner or later this drunken elevator
Is gonna stop where I'm supposed to be
It's ten past eleven, I'm half way up to heaven
But I'm stuck in reality

Night's kind of funny
Not in it for the money
But I know that I've got to pay
Love's gonna get ya
But only when I let ya
And I don't wanna turn away

Why can't the boys be the toys
That the girls want the boys to be
And why can't the girls see the world
That the boys want the girls to see, yeah

Keisha:
At night it's on the low
No front just sing the flow
We're speaking all in code
To get to the place we know
Sweat running down my back
I'm wearing leather, black
Falling into a trap
There is no turning back

I got my ladies with me
Fellas get cool and freaky
But we've gotta keep them tame
'Cause we don't wanna play that game

Everybody from the block
Needs to be feeling nice
It ain't no weakest party
But get up enjoy the ride
What you see and what you hear
Can never be exposed
Acting out of character
Is everything we know

Heidi:
My mind's kind of tender
My body's tired
It's freaky but I'm ready for this bumpy ride
Everybody's tripping
It's all insane
But the voices in my head are saying it's okay

Trying to slow it down
I raced against the rush
Gotta keep it cool to avoid the crush
Adrenaline is spinning and it's starting to show
That I've moved it on
'Cause I've changed the flow
