You always hear the shouts from my batallion
And send toy soldiers out to help me stand
And when I see you hide behind those curtain folds
I cross the room to turn the lights down low

On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
With more and more you know it won't take long
Where it burned orange let it burn gold

I wouldn't like to learn a lesson every day
Good times, bad times, it's just a price to pay
But given half a chance at turning back the tide
I'll stay at home and keep my boys in line

On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
And more and more you know it won't take long
Where it burned orange let it burn gold

And given half the chance to turn the hands of time
I'm always the bridesmade
Couldn't live with myself if I tried to be the bride

On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
With more and more you know it won't take long
Where it burned orange let it burn gold

On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
With more and more you know it won't take long
Where it burned orange let it burn gold

On common ground we'll build our castle walls
We'll build them stone by stone, and how
With more and more you know it won't take long
Where it burned orange let it burn gold
