Todays forecast, a slight chance of flurries
A slightly slim chance they might dance to worries
I won't know to say, break thru a cut away
Doom like the rain known to come back another day
Like this day like now-a-day be right there
Like [I, O, A], gimme half a light year
Same time it take y'all to drink a light beer
Feel the wrath of the tooth just like the cast of nightmare
Whoever got the cash, the mic, they both right here
What more can I say? keeps your sights clear
Bare facts, strip you naked to bare backs
The [owner] cant do jack rare tracks for your earwax
Oh snap! You hear that? Naw
Doomsday way up in the cut like maw and paw
When he come out he dumb out
There he go!
The villian with the illest flow in all of mexico
All foes on some when he leave out let me know
Just soes I can breath out before I let go
Rappers is like saschmo that you best know
Invested free dough like matthew lets go!
Sh-- followed by hail storm, snow and earthquakes
Give out more toothaches than first birthday cakes
The more we reverse scripts the worse they fate
To beat cha'll with dimes on dummy [ambesol shake]
Now u got a rhyme tummy ache by mistake
Can't call it, can't call jake, call cannonball face
[dig tapes] and stay in great shape,
Today's rap game is like one big date rape
M-F! the name ring bell like ring ding dong
He can never be wrong like ling ting tong
Once heard a hit song, sounded like an annoying gong
Tt's so wack, I didnt wanna hit the bong
Now who get iller with the pen than I do?
And in it just to get the benjamin like netenyahu? [not you]
Let the god bless you like Achoo!
Get you like whats that on your chest clook! gotchu
[PMS deep] good for you its shredded wheat
As well as getting shredded by the metal headed lead feet
Sun 'em and done 'em like a dad thats dead beat
Beat him like a dead horse nasty as red meat
Doom memorize rhymes and still forgot
Call it how he see it and kill a shot, like willard scott
In the place to be like no iller spot
To spill a knot, it's like a chilling thriller plot
Starring the villian as the black jesus
If it ain't yack or the jack is the grey goose
[stoke] can stay loose off grape juice regardless
Never-the-less did his best on the retarded test
Was trick questions, always kept a cheat sheet
On the microphone, a repper before beat street
And beat meat that MF doom he stay tru
