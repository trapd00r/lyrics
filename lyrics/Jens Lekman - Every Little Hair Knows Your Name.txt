Every cell in this body
Has been replaced since I last saw you
But the memory is in the DNA
And through the vessels and veins
It weaves a halo round the brain
Every little hair knows your name
Every little hair knows your name
Every little hair knows your name
I started working out when we broke up
I can do 100 pushups
I could probably do two if I was bored
I wrote some songs when we broke up
But nothing came out so I stopped
Every chord I struck was a miserable chord
Like an F-minor 11
Or an E-flat major 7
It all sounds the same
Every chord knows your name
Every little hair knows your name
Every little hair knows your name
