I won't ask you why
No I won't play devil's advocate
Don't wanna try and fix it
And make it about me
When you're lost and all alone in your pain
And nothing seems to make sense all in vain
You find in here a safe space to cry
And I'll just meet you there
Wherever low or high

And you can share your heart
Show yourself
I'll listen
And you can say it all
Reveal yourself
I'll listen

I'll listen, I will listen
I'll listen, I'll listen

And you can share your heart
Show yourself
When you need it
Just believe it
I'll listen
And you can say it all
Reveal yourself
When you feel it
Just believe it
I'll listen

I'll listen, I will listen
I'll listen, I'll listen

And you can share your heart
Show yourself
I'll listen
And you can say it all
Reveal yourself
I'll listen
