all in all attendant memories
Crowd the day with unrelated histories
Each year leaves its unresolving fantasies
To hang around each corner
Hang around each street

Thick with ghosts, the wind whips round in circuitries
Carrying words as strangers exchange pleasantries
Do they intrude upon your private reveries?
As they meet you on every corner
Meet you in each street

Watch for daily braveries
Notice new found courtesies
Finger sudden legacies
As they clean up every corner
Wash down every street

Mark the month and all its anniversaries
Put away the drafts of all your eulogies
Clear the way for all your private memories
As they meet you on each corner
Meet you in each street
Make the time for all your possibilities
Live on every street
