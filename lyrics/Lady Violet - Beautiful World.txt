Beautiful world
On the planet of love
Only lovers and friends
In this wonderland...
In a beautiful world
I'm going out of control
Nothing to hide
Everything is right...

There's a game to play
It brings u so much joy
There's a special place
So close to heaven

Don't be scared to fly
Beyond the moonlight
If you ease your mind
Well be together...

Start over again
Connection to heaven

You know what I mean
We'll have a good time
I'm the freak you need
It could last forever
