I wrote your picture
I hang it on my walls
I love that picture
I take it through the fall
Hanging strong
(Free for a little time)
Turn off the lights
Jump the scene

Tell me it′s not the same no
I like it better when you say my name no
Tell me it's not the same no
I like it better where the siren sings

All my loves on the battlefield
All my, all my loves
All my loves a tower it′s a deal
Steal the night

Fading picture
I paint it
It's growing through the fall
They fade with glances and chances
They live only by my spark
Turn on the lights
Jump the scene

Tell me it's not the same no
I like it better when you say my name
Tell me it′s not the same no
I like it better where the siren sings

All my loves on the battlefield
All my, all my loves
All my loves it′s a tower it's a deal
Steal the night

Steal the painting
Steal the night
Run the knife
Along the lines
Of the lives never lived

All my, all my loves
Steal the painting
Steal the night
All my nights
