Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

We've both been sound asleep
Wake up little Susie and weep
The movie's over, it's four o'clock
And weâ€™re in trouble deep

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your Mama
What are we gonna tell your Pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, I told your Mama that you'd be in by ten
Well, Susie baby, looks like we goofed again
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
We gotta go home

Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up

The movie wasn't so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie

Well, what are we gonna tell your Ma-ma
What are we gonna tell your Pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say, "Ooh la la!"

Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
Wake up, little Susie
