With a w and a w and a w dot
With a w and a w and a w dot
With a w and a w and a w dot
Ooh Mr. Murdoch can I show you around?
A new religion, no beat no rhythm
Just Wal-Mart wall to wall
A Kodak baby in the land of plenty
Honey, I blew up the world
With a w and a w and a w dot
With a w and a w and a w dot
With a w and a w and a w dot
