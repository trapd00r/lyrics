If you show me your body do you think that I'd like it
Would you stand up there proudly
Would you feel like you're dying
I don't care if your jeans don't fit that well

So don't be hiding
I am not that bothered by this stuff
You're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting
You don't have to sell it I am sold
So give me all your garbage and your gold

If I opened your wallet what would I discover
Are you cashed up or struggling with a hole in your pocket
If we spent hour late you should see the junk I spend my money on

So don't be hiding
I am not that bothered by this stuff
You're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting
You don't have to sell it I am sold
So give me all your garbage and your gold

Don't be hiding
I am not that bothered by this stuff
You're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting
You don't have to sell it I am sold
So give me all your garbage and your gold

So don't think twice
I'm not that nice
It's just the way I feel for you and any other

Don't be hiding
I am not that bothered by this stuff
You're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting
You don't have to sell it I am sold
So give me all your garbage and your gold
