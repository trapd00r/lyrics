Gee, but its great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
I've been on the road so long, my friend
And if you came along I know you wouldn't disagree

It's the same old story, yeah
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the bible

And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
I'm just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied

Deputy sheriff said to me
Tell me what you come here for, boy
You better get your bags and flee
You're in trouble boy and now you're heading into more

And it's the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the bible

And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
I'm just trying to keep the customers satisfied
Satisfied

But it's the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the bible

And I'm so tired
I'm oh so tired
But I'm trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied
