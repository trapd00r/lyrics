Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own
Why do you have to leave me?
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
Hold on onto me

Now I see, now I see

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way and it's okay
Ladadadada, it's okay

It feels like nothing really matters anymore
When you're gone, I can't breathe
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
This can't be happening

Now I see (now I see), now I see

Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way and it's okay

Ladadadada it's okay

Lalalala

So many questions, so much on my mind
So many answers I can't find
I wish I could turn back the time
I wonder why

Everybody hurts some days (some days)
Everybody hurts some days (some days)

Everybody hurts some days (some days)
It's okay to be afraid (I'm afraid)
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way and it's okay

Ladadadada it's okay
Lalalalala it's okay

Everybody hurts some days
(Some days)
It's okay to be afraid
(I'm afraid)
Everybody hurts some days
Yeah, we all feel pain (It's okay)
Everybody feels this way
But it'll be okay (some days)
Can't somebody take me away
To a better place?
Everybody feels this way

(Ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh-ahhhh)

Ladadada it's okay
Lalalala, it's okay
Ladadada it's okay
Lalalala, it's okay
