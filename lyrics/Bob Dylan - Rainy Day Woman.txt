Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good
They'll stone you just like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to go home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you when you're walkin' on the street
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walkin' to the door

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say good luck

Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar

Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright

Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say you are brave
They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave

But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
