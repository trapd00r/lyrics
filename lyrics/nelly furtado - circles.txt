The day is getting late
It's a lot to take
Looking at your face
It hides nothing
Emotions are recycled
I open the window
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling stifled

Then I get just a glimpse
I see where our love is
Please look into my eyes
Baby you gotta try to

Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Don't talk in circles

You don't know what to say
How did we get this way
It's like we just press play
And run on automatic (it gets so static)
I can barely breathe
You're filling up with steam
You say it's about me
But I'm just setting boundaries

Then I see a bright light
I see it's worth the fight
I know we'll get it right
Baby our love can shine if you

Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Don't walk in circles

We're after the same things
Bursting at the same seams
I cannot carry the whole load here
No I can't tell you what that means
I'm gonna carry my load
If you promise not to take your eyes off me
Don't take your eyes off me
Don't take your eyes off me
Let's break the circle
