i can tell by your eyes 
that youÂ´ve probably been crying forever 
and the stars in the sky 
donÂ´t mean nothing to you theyÂ´re a mirror 
i donÂ´t wanna talk about it 
how you broke my heart 
if i stay here just a little bit longer 
if i stay here wonÂ´t you listen to my heart 
my heart 
if i stand all alone 
will the shadows hide the color of my heart 
will they be blue for the tears 
black for the nights we spent apart 
and the stars donÂ´t mean nothing to you 
theyÂ´re a mirror 
i donÂ´t wanna talk about it 
how you broke my heart 
oh if i stay, if i stay here 
wonÂ´t you listen to my heart 
i donÂ´t wanna talk about it 
how you broke my heart 
if i stay, if i stay here just a little bit longer 
if i stay here wonÂ´t you listen to my heart 
if i stand all alone 
will the shadows hide the colors of my heart
