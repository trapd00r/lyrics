It comes from somewhere
To someone It belongs
It’s needing its hearts
It’s choosing among

It’s got no name
The one
With the most pian

How many days
How many nights
What will we do
To treat them right

It’s strange how time
Plays God sometimes

Sorrow calls
Sorrow takes
Sorrow nust be
God’s mistake

I’m losing a morning
Every time you’re not there
I’m losing my life
Now I don’t care
You where mine
And now stops time
