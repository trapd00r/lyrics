(feat. Linkin Park)

So I collapse, I'm spilling these raps
As long as you feel them to the day that I drop
You'll never say that I'm not killing them,
Cause what I am not, then I'mma stop penning them
Man, I am not hip-hop, and I'm not Eminem!
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and ... venom
Adrenaline, shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot, listen up!
You ... forgot .... does not give a fuck!

Hook:
(Again and again)
You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because
(We want our future back,
We want our own mistakes to take our own path
We wanna do it again!)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking?
I'll have to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve.
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth,
That would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse.
My thoughts are sporadic,
I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers,
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest!

Hook:
(Again and again)
You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough
Again and again
You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because
(We want our future back,
We want our own mistakes to take our own path
We wanna do it again!)

I will stand
Feels like no one can beat me down!
