'Scuse me girl, I know it's a bit... embarrassing but I just noticed some tan lines on your shirt...

See I reckon you about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in 4 beers' time
That blue top shirt top you've got on, is nice
Bit too much fake tan though but, yeah you score high
But there's just one little thing that's just really really really really annoying me about you, ya see
Yeah yeah like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh! don't you just know it

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue lookin' at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out o' the corner of my eye
Lookin' toward my direction your eyes locked on my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

Woa
Leave it out
Are you smoking crack or something?
Leave it out
Mike just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
It's not worth it Mike
Leave it out
Just leave it
Don't touch me
Leave it out
Don't touch me I'm all right
Don't... Look I'm all right...

For a while there I was thinkin', yeah but what if
Picturing myself pulling with bare white-heart wit
Staring as you standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing was clocking onto you too, yeah
I had to admit
That yeah yeah you are fit and yeah I do want it
But I stopped sharkin' a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier, due to the brew,
But I am digressing slightly so I'll continue
I didn't wanna bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you see yes yes you are really rude
And rude as in good I knew she said as she queued
But I just did not wanna give the satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
Your fit but my gosh don't you know it

Oi just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like "nah, I can't even, no you look grand"
But you looked sharp there smiling hard suggesting and,
Leaning away with your hearty hearty lookin' tan
But I admit the next bit was spanners to my plan
You walked toward my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

What do I give a fuck I've got a girlfriend anyway
(Whoa! We've all had a drink mate!)
Oi were all a bit drunk we've had a few fair play
I've got this stella I bombed from that last cafe
This nights not even begun
Yes yes oh yay

I did fancy you a bit though, yeah I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

Haha
Heh heh heh!

You're fit but you know it!
You're fit but you know it!
I think I'm going to fall over!
I think I'm going to fall o...

Fuckin' 'ell!
