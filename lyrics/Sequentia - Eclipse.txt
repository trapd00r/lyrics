My sequential circuits never last
Eyes without a trace
But that face is strange
It's playing games
With the ones I mostly love

Strictly out of phase
Phasing through the space
Using the wrong phrase

We are blind
We are colorful
Blossoms open up
No you can not fool
My detection tool
For the ones I mostly love

Strictly out of phase
Phasing through the space
Using the wrong phrase

Strictly out of phase
Phasing through the space
Using the wrong phrase
The wrong phrase
