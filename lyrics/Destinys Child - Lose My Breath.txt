Hit me!

Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant*
Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

Ooh...
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like you don't know what to do
After I done done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast, baby now I can't find you
Ooh...
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like you can't come through
All them lines like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel but you can't drive me

Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant*
Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

Ooh...
Two things I don't like when I'm trynna get my groove
Is a partner that meets me only halfway, and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifegaurd and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Ooh...
You understand the facts that I'm trynna get to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't momma teach you to give affection
Learn the difference from a man and an adolescent
It ain't you boo, so get ta steppin'

Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant*
Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath
Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant*
Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some
You ain't really want none
If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed

Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my *pant pant*
Can you keep up?
Babyboy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath
