The car zoomed past, I watched the passers by
Birds flew backwards, yet still arrived

Winter seemed to linger
But now the swallows have arrived
Won't be long until summertime

Walked through woods to the power lines
Saw birds fly backwards in perfect line

Oh, winter seemed to melt now
Now the swallows have arrived
Can't be long 'til summertime, summertime
