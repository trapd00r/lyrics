(Royce Da 5'9")
Yo, yo. It's several different levels to pickin' up shovels
And dumpin' you in ditches under sea-level, front and you can witness
Let me refreshen you niggas; tell you my position in this
Beef! — Leave you under Venice, opposition finished!
Here it is, we invaded, created a pyramid
of a haven of names, so blame Dre and that ear o' his
So (heavy breathing) breathe, I rather reach for your neck
And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me wit' less
I got a skunk in my trunk
I'm lyin' — I got a pump in my trunk
You dyin'. How many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all.
We too incredibly raw, for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open up that can of worms, I hope you ready for the dirt that's wit' it
Slap a ho, snatch a mic.
Bein' brought to y'all in black and in white
(It's the new!) Joe Jackson and Ike.
We renegades!

(Eminem)
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it wit' 'em a minute
'cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all 'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference — they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict — like you didn't experiment?
N—now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage! (Ha ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
Think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'cause here we go: he's Royce, he's the King of Detroit
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, he's just a—

(Eminem)
Renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
About anything. (Anything?) Anything.

I determine what time it's on, I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limón and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks
I'm tired of niggas that's like ("I'm 'bout to blow!")
'less you a bitch, we don't care if you 'bout to do that
Move back, youngster, the glock gon' speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco-meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
or flash the clip, or give you the picture (Developed it.)
Click-clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip-Hop Quotable tug o' war (Yeah!)
Who did you niggas beats, you bitches, who made it work?
That shit was (raspberry) — I got harder two-way alerts.
Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, he probably go get you the nina;
You talk about his momma, he won't even give you the finger
He's (Crazy!) Deranged! Not media eaters, we renegades!

(Eminem)
See I'm a poet to some — a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate, Satanist, scatter-brained athiest
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter — a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water — no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube — motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a mo'fuckin'
