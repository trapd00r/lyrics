(Dr. Dre)
Yeah, yo lets bring it

[Chorus](Eminem)
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
Will u be as hard as you say you are
Or you gonna run and go get your body guard I said

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
Show us you as hard as you say you are
Or you gonna run and go get your body guard

(Dr. Dre)
Niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend their whole life battlin' drugs
Slangin dope and hopes of one day
Bein able to own they own label
And give the game up
Some niggas came up
And some just didn't
It's just the way it is
If it aint minute just isn't
Some niggas'll get money
And pay niggas to back em
So they can act up
Feel comfortable an rap tough
And that's ass backwards
Them niggas'll keep comin back
And that's when extortion happens
To the struggle to get free
I know how this shit be
You give anything that look legitimately
But you gonna find if you do get in this industry
That it's best to do bussiness with me then against me
Niggas get behind mics and aint even emcees
Niggas get on mtv just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Watching you saddle life in my bentley
You niggas aint even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissing
I don't even listen to ya shit
To know who the fuck I'm dissing
And media just feeds into these feuds
Trying to add fuel to the fire
This little nigga Ja Rule
Talking about he's gonna slap me
Nigga please you gotta jump
And swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview em
All they doing is making fake threats to us through em
Ya pussy ya not Pac I knew em
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fucking insult to him
It's too bad, we had a fall out before he passed
Because if he could he see this shit now
He'd be whoopin your ass
You're talkin to a pioneer who engineered this shit
For nineteen years who ya got in ya ear Ssssss (Suge)
I aint even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit trying to be tough nigga,
You look like an asshole

[Chorus](Eminem)
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
Will u be as hard as you say you are
Or you gonna run and go get your body guard I said

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
Show us you as hard as you say you are
Or you gonna run and go get your body guard

(Obie Trice)
They say why don't we increase the peace
The only piece to crease
Is that which deletes ya peeps
Cuz niggas run mouths but they don't want streets
Till that 4-5 decease ya speech
Ya it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Coulda reached a peak
Now ya left with a horrible leap
I'm trying to be as bleep
With my speech as possible
Just incase a nigga try to throw me an obstacle
Nigga I'm not boxing you
I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you he don't rid you
You back on them streets
I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition ya tissue
Give a fuck if you bring all ten of them with you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentleman fickle
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pull ya skirt up ya got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off DAMN
And quit tellin all these magazines ya plans
How you gonna slap up my man, ya fictious
Nigga we'll send stan to come murder ya bitches

[Chorus](Eminem)
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
Will u be as hard as you say you are
Or you gonna run and go get your body guard I said

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man
Show us you as hard as you say you are
Or you gonna run and go get your body guard

(Obie Trice)
Hahaha. Yeah, go out and buy
All the gangstas you want nigga
Matter of fact go get every
Gangster from everyhood
In the United States of America
To back you nigga,
Aint nobody riding with you
You can't see that
You fell off nigga
