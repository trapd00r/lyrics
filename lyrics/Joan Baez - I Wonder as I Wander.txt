I wonder as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die
For poor on'ry people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander...
Out under the sky

When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall
And the promise of ages...
It then did recall

Ooh...

If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing
A star in the sky, or a bird on the wing
Or all of God's Angels in heaven for to sing
He surely could have seen it...
'Cause he was the King

I wonder as I wander out under the sky
How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die
For poor on'ry people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander...
Out under the sky
