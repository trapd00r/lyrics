(Obie Trice)
Can we re- can we re-enact Biggie's song?
C-can you shit on me?
I just want you to shit on me

(Hook - Eminem (singing))
Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherf**kin' emotions
I'll kill you
Bitch I'm f**kin'
For real I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you f**k me then I'll make you fall in love

(in the background of the hook)
Hey lady, hey lady
I don't think you really wanna be my girl
(be my girl, be my girl, be my girl)
F**kin' with me can be dangerous (dangerous, dangerous)
You never know what I really (be like, be like)
(be like, be like, I'm your type)
(And might even get a little bit crazy)

(Obie Trice)


Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
And Magnums to lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a ho I abuse (yes)
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
When I f**k the shit out you, then the next date (bitch)
I rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own
No, I'm in and out your home
And this in and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around (nah)
I bounce 'em around
Camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
How that sound?
If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown
F**k with them clowns until I pound on your crown
Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be
