Seven islands to the high side 
Of the bay, 'cross the bay
To the sunset through the blue light
Of a fiery autumn haze

We went walkin' on the high side 
Of the bay on a chilly morn
And we saw how leaves have fallen 
On the beds where trees are born

Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there 

Seven islands to the high side 
Of the bay if you're looking west
To the sunset you can see it
All in fiery autumn dress

Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused 

Living high in the city
Guess you think it's a pretty good way
You get to learn that when you get burned 
You got nothing to say
You seem to think because you got 
Chicken to go you're in luck

Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out'a luck 

Look around at the morning
Guess you're doing the best you can
Surely you know that when you go 
Nobody gives you a hand
Think of the air you're breathing in
Think of the time you waste
Think of the right and wrong 
And consider the frown on your face 

It's time you tried living on the high side
Of the bay, you need a rest
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away 
Could be so blessed

Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold 

If you feel it you better believe it, 
You're gonna see it, do you really know
It is rising like a feather, 
Dipping and dancin' from below
There's a new wave that is breaking
In the wake of a passing ship
Every nation gonna be shaken
Put it together, don't let it slip 

It's time you tried living on the high side 
Of the bay, you need a rest
Any man or a woman with a wish to fade away 
Could be so blessed 

Seven islands to the high side 
Of the bay, 'cross the bay
To the sunset through the blue light 
Of a fiery autumn haze

To the sunset through the blue light 
Of a fiery autumn haze
