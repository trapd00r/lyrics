I'm older than the moon
And twice as wise
But I keep myself together
As I make way through this crowd
For if I would breathe out
I would sweep everyone of there high, high heels

Now wont you please use me for my soul is grand
My brain's partly ?
And I'm excellent in bed
Let's forget about tomorrow and the price upon my head
Let's forget

And let us dance
All stiff and athletic
Over us the moon surrounded with stars
The consequent ascetics
Stand out so young, so fresh and modern
Next to the fading glory of all things living

Things in the world
You divide them in three
It's the light
It's the dark
It's what comes in between
My love I'm afraid we belong to the latter
Destined to dwell in the midst of all matter

Days are like islands
And nights are like oceans
Fortune and fame come and go with the tide
As there's virtue and vice
And love and denial and regret

And here we dance
All stiff and athletic
Over us the moon surrounded with stars
The consequent ascetics
Stand out so young, so fresh and modern
Next to the fading glory of all things living
