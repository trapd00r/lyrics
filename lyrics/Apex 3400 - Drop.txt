[Verse 1]
Popping pills til' I can't Dr. Phil my face
Got a bad bitch that's nothing less than great
Triple plays, man I might hit the base
Like porno bitches moans, man all these niggas fake
Turn a nigga ghost just like he wrote for Drake
The shit I've been through, boy you can't relate
And the same niggas that was starving with me is the only niggas eating off my plate
Lord, I'm praying for my enemies
And anyone that was a friend of me
Niggas hating that's a tendency
Just me making money is the remedy
I want a big diamond in a big ring, big team doing big things
Pull up on a nigga block with that big beam, let that bitch ring
You know...

[Hook]
I got some act in my cup, I'm gone sip it 'til it's empty
All these drugs gone keep me up, she gone suck me 'til I'm empty
I'm the one that's coming up, I'm the one these niggas envy
Smoking weed and praise the lord, all until my soul is empty
Empty

[Verse 2]
I got that dough, I got that dough
Yeah, you know
Make a bitch drop to the floor
I'm bouta glo, I'm bouta glo
Yeah, you know
I got no love for a hoe
Call me Pablo, got that coco for the low
White bitches can't feel their nose
I know, I know
Yeah, I know, I know ahhh
She see a nigga bouta glo, she see a nigga on the road, yeah
She gone do anything I want, just cause a nigga got that dough, yeah
One thing that I know for sure, just leave your morals at the door, yeah, yeah
Just leave your morals at the door
Theo Moralz at the door, girl
