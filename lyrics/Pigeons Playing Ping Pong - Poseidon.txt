[Chorus]
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to

[Verse 1]
You lift me up, throw me through the sky
You got me so excited, my wings can fly
I wander off, 'til we leave the Earth
The ground is so inviting, let's claim our worth
You got me so excited, I found you in my life
Wind me up, cause we're all just fishing line

[Verse 2]
He throws it down, 'til we're with the poles
The ground is so in silence, it's wet and cold
I burrow down, 'til I cannot see
The ground is cold and quiet, but you're so warmly
You got me so excited, I found you in my life
Wind me up, cause we're all just fishing line

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
Poseidon took my boat, I need a home to return to
