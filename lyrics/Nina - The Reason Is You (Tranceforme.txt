This train is riding slow
And that train never will
One is always heading for the sea
And the other wants to ride the hill

Both trains were our trains
All of our life, together
Now you say that you don't want to ride no more
On my train

Dam dam dam dee do do
I know I will lose you
Dam dam dam dee do do
The reason is you

Dam dam dam dee do do
Why do I lose you
Dam dam dam dee do do
The reason is you

The reason is you
The reason is you
My train is pink and brown
Colors you never liked

How could you have fallen in love with me
When there was so much more
You never liked
My train was our train

Oh look that life together
Now you say that you don't want to ride no more
On my train
