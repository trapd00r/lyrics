Turned on the station but there's nothing there
Changed our location but we don't know where
So we're swapping the position to the one we know
And we're setting on fire all that we ever let go

Turned at the corner, took the 105
Down to the quarter where the world slid by
It's the things that separate us never make it through
There's a break in the wire, bringing it over to you

Do you know the way to make us move?
Do you know the way to make it through?
I'll never get up again (til we do it together)
I'll never go out again (til we do it together)
I'll never check in again (til we do it together)
All the way to the end (til we do it together)

It's never easter over halloween
It's never seven over seventeen
There's another situation making it alright
It's the wrong information figuring how to be right

Do you know the way to make us move?
Do you know the way to make it through?
I'll never get up again (til we do it together)
I'll never go out again (til we do it together)
I'll never check in again (til we do it together)
All the way to the end (til we do it together)

So we'll never take the corner
Never take the score
Never take the money anymore
So we're swapping the position
To the one we know
And we're setting on fire all that we ever let go

Do you know the way to make us move?
Do you know the way to make it through?
I'll never get up again (til we do it together)
I'll never go out again (til we do it together)
I'll never check in again (til we do it together)
All the way to the end (til we do it together)
I'll never get up again (til we do it together)
I'll never go out again (til we do it together)
I'll never check in again (til we do it together)
All the way to the end (til we do it together)
