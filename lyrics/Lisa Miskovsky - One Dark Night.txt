When I came there, I was dressed in blues
Watched her dancing, without no shoes
I couldn't help it, but I was feeling down
Wanted her to disappear, when I led her down

She's your angel, she's your altitude
And I'm a broken Lady, and I act way too, way too rude

In another life, oh, what a strange excuse
I'm left here all alone, well, well, well, well I'm still having fun
When nothing matters, something changes inside
My eyes cried a thousand tears, my arms were open wide

Cause you don't love me, oh how I wanted you
It's always that extra hand that will pull you, will pull you through
