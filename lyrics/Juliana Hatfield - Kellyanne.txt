Kellyanne
I don't understand
The way you make me feel
The way you turn me upside down
The way my heart sinks when you come around
Like suddenly I don't know who I am

Kellyanne
The effect you have
You make me feel like animal
All my good sense goes out the window
And it tears me up to see you so composed

Kellyanne
You make me mad
You're so hard like a rock in my shoe
Like every bitch in high school

Do you love
Do you feel
Did you used to be real
Is there any blood underneath your steely mask

Kellyanne
You're on fire in my dreams
Your straw hair catches instantly
Your painted plastic face is melting
And you end up in a puddle at my feet

Kellyanne
You're a telegraph of vicious grace and pride
Turning truth into lies

Kellyanne
Are you ever sad
I wanna be the first one to make you cry
I wanna make you cry
Wanna make you cry
I can't take it anymore

Kellyanne
I light the match in my dreams
You burn
I watch you burn but you don't even squirm
Imperturbable until the end
You're smiling as your face is melting
And sliding off your skull down to the ground
