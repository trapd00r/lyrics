I love you, I love you

You say that you love me,
We both know you don't mean it every day.
But somehow you got me,
So I'll put up with anything you say.

Because I love you
Because I love you

I'd rather be with you, whenever,
Than without you all the time.
And I will forgive you, whatever,
Just to say that you are mine.

Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you

I love you, do you love me,
When tomorrow comes I guess we'll see,
When I push in, you pull out,
But you still need me.

Yes, I do,
Yes, I do,
Yes, I do now
Yes, I do,
Yes, I do,
Yes, I do now

Because I love you (Yes, I do, Yes, I do, Yes, I do now)
Because I love you (Yes, I do, Yes, I do, Yes, I do now)
Because I love you (Yes, I do, Yes, I do, Yes, I do now)
