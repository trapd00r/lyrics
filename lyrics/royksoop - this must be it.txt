Waiting for a beam to break through here
A chain way vision all bright and clear
And they talk and they dance 

I was expecting something pure with a golden hair 
Arms full of bracelets and smoke in the air 
And they talk and they dance

Here comes darkness just afternoon
Waiting for a sign 
If I survive I’ll worship the moon
Well something, anything

This must be it 
Longed for bliss 
First it was so quiet 
Now I know I’m not alone in here

And they talked, and they danced

Two elements collide in my open head
Making me a viewer
I am water and sand
And they talk and they dance 

Your hand on my hips speak friendly to me
I’ve been studying for years patiently 
Is this as far you can take me?

This must be it 
Longed for bliss 
First it was so quiet 
Now I know I’m not alone in here
 
And they talked, and they danced
