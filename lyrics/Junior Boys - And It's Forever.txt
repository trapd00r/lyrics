'Cause this phase is finally over
And there's only me and you
Cause the night can't wait forever
And I don't really know what to do

This flash escaped
To side your flare
You seize it moves about
You've lost me

Escape from the lights
Away from the nights we've known
With more broken hearts
No innocent flights that show
Cause it's the first time
And the last time tonight
But after awhile
You'll realize
That's how it goes

Your lips are full
Inside your coat
You reach the face
And fill this space

Escape from the lights
Away from the nights we've known
With no broken hearts
No innocent flights that show
Cause it's the first time
And the last time tonight
But after awhile
You'll realize
That's how it goes
