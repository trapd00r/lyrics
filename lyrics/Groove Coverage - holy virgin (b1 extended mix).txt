I'm a real lady,
Treat me like a baby;
I've been waiting weekly
For someone like you

Can you share my passion,
Earning my obsession.
I want satisfaction
All of the time.

If you want to taste me,
Try my paradise.
Come, and feel up my desire.

You can please me,
Taste me,
Take me to the sky;
Baby, we can burn like fire.

I am your holy virgin,
Be gentle all the time.
I am your holy virgin,
I'll blow your mind.

I am your holy virgin,
And if you touch me right,
I'll be your nasty virgin.

I can take you places,
Show you all my faces;
No, I don't wrap the paces,
We're gonna be there.

Do you wanna hold me
When I feel lonely?
Slowly you consume me,
Angel of mine.

If you want to taste me,
Try my paradise.
Come, and feel up my desire.

You can please me,
Taste me,
Take me to the sky;
Baby, we can burn like fire.

I am your holy virgin,
Be gentle all the time.
I am your holy virgin,
I'll blow your mind.

I am your holy virgin,
And if you touch me right,
I'll be your nasty virgin.

Now the curtain falls,

Hand just calls.
Open up your eyes
For someone like me!

I'm on my way,
Leaving today,
I'm gonna ride
To the other side.

If you want to taste me,
Try my paradise.
Come, and feel up my desire.

You can please me,
Taste me,
Take me to the sky;
Baby, we can burn like fire (like fire).

I am your holy virgin,
Be gentle all the time.
I am your holy virgin,
I'll blow your mind.

I am your holy virgin,
And if you touch me right,
I'll be your nasty virgin
