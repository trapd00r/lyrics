Looking counter clockwise
Knowing what could happen
Any moment maybe you
Maybe even you

Steadfast collapse
Always certain any moment
Maybe you maybe you
Maybe even you
Recline complete dream too sweet
I can't do it not with you
Not even with you
Maybe never with you

And I'd sell my soul for
Total control
Yeah I'd sell my soul for
Total control

Street wet tonight, lovers touch
It's pure delight
Always certain any moment
Maybe even you
Stay in bed stained sheets
My head hurts I repeat
Maybe you maybe you
Maybe even you

And I'd sell my soul for
Total control
Oh I'd sell my soul for
Total control

Over you
Over you
Total control over you
Over you
Total control over you
Over you
Total control over you
Over you
Total control over you
Over you
Total control over you
Over you
Total control over you
