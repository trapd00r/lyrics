Artist: kid rock f/ eminema shimmy shimmy go go motha fuckin pop
Itâs the k-k-kid rock with the k-k-kid rock shit
Iâm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been gettinâ laid and paid thatâs why I never complain
If I ainât in it for the money Iâm in it for the p (or is it d)
Itâs 1998 yo and you still canât fuck with me
You donât be fuckinâ with the blue eye
Fuckinâ with my 2-5 up your fuckinâ ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like voodoo
You do what we say and weâll do what we want to
Weâre fuckinâ up your city and weâre fuckinâ up your progam
Fuckinâ all your bitches we can fuckinâ give a goddamn
Twisted brown gets down with no assistance
We wonât quit until weâre banned from existence
Persistance pays if that holds true
Then Iâm gonna buy this fuckinâ planet before the time Iâm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no takings
So let me get what I got cominâ and the rest Iâm fakinâ
Iâm shakinâ like jerry lee lewis and shit
You act like the motherfuckerâs new at this shit
But Iâve been true to this shit givenâ my heart and soul
Been shininâ like a diamond but gettinâ passed as coal
So fuck off
Yeah

With my pants half hanginâ off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom trippinâ sippinâ shots of jack
âcause the kids donât listen gettinâ lots of flack
I be the do wa diddy up and down you block and
The 10 karat kid with my triggers cockinâ
The k the I the d r-o-c k motherfucker and you still donât know me
So blow me bitch I donât rock for *edited*
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Donât have no answers so pass the joint
Iâm just paid in full and made in detroit
I ride like setta in the indy 5
And get live with that which getâs me high
Strive for perfection this much is true
We do what we say you say what we do
Kid rock I couldnât be no bozo
And I get too much nina
*edited* and my glock rolls solo to arizona
Iâm an easy rider dreaminâ of wynonna
I roam the country like a greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
Iâm not peter pan I donât fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And harry carey couldnât call my game
Fucked so many hoes Iâm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I donât mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck off
Yeah right in your mother fuckinâ ass bitch
With that detroit city shit ainât shit swift weâre on the same script
Nothing new since 76 kid rock
Yo slim shady come break these mother fuckers off

(eminem)
Yo tell the world to hold their breath theyâre breathing the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and like noise
Hang around drugs loud music and like noise
Slim shady and brown trucker another bunch of mother fuckers
Who hate the world as much as each other
And I ainât leaving this party tonight
âtil I see some naked bitches dancinâ around drunk touchinâ each other
Rum and pepsi got your perception of me sketchy
âcause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
âcause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do âshrooms you all better give me two rooms
âcause Iâm fuckinâ the first one up
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
âcause you know Iâm losinâ it when Iâm rappinâ to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fool
And ever single teenager that hates school

Fuck off
