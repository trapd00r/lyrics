We all come in from the cold
We come down from the wire
And everybody warms themselves
To a different fire

When sometimes we get burned
You'd think sometime we'd learn
The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You ain't got no one
You better go back out and find her

Just like children hidin' in a closet
Can't tell what's goin' on outside
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten path
We get taken for a ride

By a parlor trick or some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think that thee one you love could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody, darlin'
Sometimes bites the hand that feeds

When I look around
Everybody always brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there ain't no peace to found

But if someone really cared
Well, they'd take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one's despair
Remember in this game we call life
That no one said it's fair

Ooh, yeah
Breakdown (let me hear it now)
Breakdown (let me hear it now, yeah)
Breakdown (let me hear it now)
Get down with yo' bad self, alright

I've come to know the cold
I think of it as home
When there ain't enough of me to go around
I'd rather be left alone

But if I call you out of habit
I'm out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me if I fit you needs
Like when we both knew we had it

But now the damage's done
And we're back out on the run
Funny how everything was roses
When we held on to the guns
Just because you're winnin'
Don't mean you're the lucky ones

Breakdown (let me hear it now)
Breakdown (yeah)
Breakdown
Breakdown (let me hear it now)
Hay yay

There goes the challenger
Being chased by the blue blue meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver
The last American hero
The-the electric sintar
The demi-god
The super driver of the golden west
Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting closer-closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile, yeah baby
They about to strike, they gonna get him, SMASH ! RAPE !
The last beautiful free soul on this planet

But, it is written
If the Evil Spirit arms the Tiger with claws
Brahman provided wings for the Dove
Thus spake the Super Guru
"Did you hear that"
