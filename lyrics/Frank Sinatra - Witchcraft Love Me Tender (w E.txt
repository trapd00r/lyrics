(Frank Sinatra)
Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

(Elvis Prelsey)
Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

(Frank Sinatra)
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will

(Elvis Presley)
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch

'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

(Frank Sinatra)
I love you
And I always will

(Elvis and Frank)
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will
