Let's close our eyes and walk across the sky (x4)

Whatever comes from me don't part from you
Whatever happens feel so close to you
Only dream is to save a dream
Only wanted to save a place
All I need is to feel release
like a whale would run through the sea

Let's close our eyes and walk across the sky (x2)

What will ya say as the rain fills up your mind
And whatever you do, will be that way for life
What will ya say as the rain fills up your mind
And whatever you do, will be that way for life
