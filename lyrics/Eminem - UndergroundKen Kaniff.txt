A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know, I'm back now
Haha!

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up
Broken tibia's, fibula's, yeah fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of 'em dying from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeve's Sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy Pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Whack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask and a boxing match
(He can't say that!)
Yes he can, I just did faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next o' kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy, especially when I flex again
And throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement
So faggoty, faggoty, faggoty, Raggedy Ann an' Andy
No, Raggedy Andy an' Andy. No, it can't be, it can't be!
Yes, it can be! The fucking Antichrist is back, Danny
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville — calamity, goddammit, insanity
Pills, fanny-pack filled with Xanies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilt on my silk negligée, looky
Razor b-lades with me to make you b-leed
Cases of Maybelline make-up lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Till he jumps out the fucking toilet when you're takin' a pee

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Six semen samples, seventeen strands o' hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can-opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fucking doctor I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fucking Vicodin like I'm a viking
Oh, lightnin' is strikin' it might be a fucking sign I need a psychic-
Evaluation. Fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking lesbian, shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missing both legs and begging to stay

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions then split a bag of Funions
Mad at me, Understandable, cannibal shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a Trick or Treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers
Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine
And sat him in the fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fucking Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, Ooh
Looking like I got into a fucking pillow fight with a Triple Fat Goose
Insanity, can it be vanity, where's the humanity
In havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm-and-leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred an eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
Cut your fuckin' head off and ask, "Where you headed off to?"
Get it? "Headed off to?" Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco!

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground


Rehab Meeting
Random Guy
I had to get sober.
It wasn't a choice, it was, I had to do this.
And now I got 90 days clean.
And uh, that's all I have to share. 
Thanks.

Meeting Coordinator
Well thanks for sharing Brian.
There anyone else who'd like to share this evening.

Ken Kaniff 
Yeah, I got something to share...

*Singing*
When you walk, through the door, you were queer to me (Is he tap dancing?)
So come here baby boy, just come here to me (Uhh why's he taking his clothes off?)
You're a cock boy, everybody wants you (That's gross)
You're gayer, than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So homie...
Lay down, down down (I'm gettin' out of here)
Lay down, down down
Lay down, down down (Have a good night)
Lay down, lay down

*Talking*
Uhh, where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay.A.
Ok wait, I got another one...

*Singing*
I just love condoms and lots of cum

*Talking*
No?
Oh, shit.
*Door Close*
