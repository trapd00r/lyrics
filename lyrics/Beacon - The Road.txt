And you were something I was waiting on
With every warning, I knew I wanted more
Until I can't breathe and it's coming on
And then there's nothing but skin and bones

And you were something I was waiting for
I heard the calling, I knew I wanted it all
Until I can't breathe and it's coming on
I'm left with nothing but skin and bones

Watch the time
I know there's something on your mind
You're giving everything, so there's nothing to hold back
We were off that train but now we're back on track
And we were off that train but now we're back on track

So don't ask to control
What we've become
No, don't ask for control
When we have none

And you know the time it takes
So go slow or you'll burn in a blaze, a blaze
So you know the time it takes
So go slow or you'll burn in a blaze, a blaze
