[Intro]
Dawg....I shouldn't have left, They wouldn't have tried this shit if I was wit ya
Maybe we would have picked another time
Or chose another way
Or maybe my prayers would have convinced him to choose another soul
Shit, it's just me and my man Tony now
Man you look so peaceful right now... how can I argue wit that
They say...

[Chorus:]
They say the good die young,
That's why I think that you should have fun (when your young)
Cos time won't wait for no one (uh huh)
When god calls, you gotta go home (go home)
They say the good die young, (die young)
That's why I know that we go' have fun,
In this life cos you only get one
When God calls for me, don't cry I just went home

[Kon Artis]
It's true that everybody heard, their mama say every days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the mist
In the struggle, went through circumstances
Arrested every day just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen to any man
A woman is dumb enough to pretend
That her, god won't hold them accountable for sins
If they commit, they try to repent the sense of Repent
But I guess (that's just the way things go)
I was blessed to see 24 (24)
To wake up to that "Hi, my name is" video
Motivated me to write what i wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
An mom and daddy want to move our road
I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show
I just which we ain't have to lose Bugz to the struggle
Cos you know...

[Chorus]

[Bizzare]
I know you used to Bizzare on some silly shit
But niggas in my cliq, is dying quick
In Detroit, niggas don't party
They pull a .44 out, snatch off Bacardis
That's why I keep the pistol under the trunk
I'm 27 years old, too old to be getting jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts, b-u-g-z
Tattooed on my wrist
Me and you in the jeep, listen to swing beats
It's a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is D
Peace to 31 and 51-50, miss you

[Kuniva]
I came back on that tragic day, my phone rung
And Bizarres voice telling me, Bugz was gone home
It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breath
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear with this weight dawg, I cried so hard
Literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now it's tearing me apart
But I had to let it out cos it was tearing at my heart
Cos he died over something so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious I hope you all
Understand how I'm feeling cos I love you bugz
I wanna rhyme wit you, laugh wit you, hug you bugz
But I can't and you was so close to seeing dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track as just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
Cos you know

[Chorus]

[Proof]
They say it's never too late, to have an early childhood
If I could, turn back the hands of time, God should
Forgive what i did as a kid to run blocks
Now my dreams are just dream cops and gun shots
The fun stops when your homies up in a box
My dudey bole, rest his soul, snuffed by the cops
I use to question a lot, if there's a guy by me say something
If you love her so much why didn't u gave nothing
When he took my homie, snuck was only in 11th grade
Now I hope to see your face at the heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, this hating remains
With a grudge to see slugs straight through my frame
My heart aches with the pain, the life in his breath
We gotta have fun now, theres only minutes left
In the depth, distress youngin's are sucked in
To get tats of my fallen homies, I ain't got enough skin

[Chorus]

[Swifty]
When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise
That crash and the driver died,
My partner on the passenger side was paralysed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride that the other peeps survived
Nine months later another one died
Somebody shot him in the side when he was starting up his ride
3 years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when funky got done, a joey playing wit guns
And tookie over funds, karty was my man
And reggy, I wish that I was wit you in that van
And Bugz if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standing in this booth,
That's the truth, I miss you all...

[Chorus x2]
