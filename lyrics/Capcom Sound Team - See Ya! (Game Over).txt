Everywhere I go, I bring the team with me
Everywhere I go, I bring the team with me
Everywhere I go, I bring the team with me
Everywhere I go, I bring the team with me
(Check me out, yo, boom)

All I'm tryna do is generate Ps, I'm a G
Tell them man there not to imitate me
I've been feeling like a motherfucking winner lately
Thinking "shall I go and cop another Bimmer?" Maybe
We'll see, furthermore I might cop the Audi
With the keyless entry, cuh don't wanna use key
Tell the filthy five-O that I just wanna be free
Tell me if you've ever heard another rapper like me
Who's he? Nah man, it's not that
Tell them man they can't do it like Skrapz
When them man there make tracks, it's not fluent like that
That's becuh they haven't never been through it like that
Rappers and their dead tracks, call it suicide raps
Me on the other hand, I've got the homicide flow
Put me in the studio, turn into psycho
I don't think that Ice City's got any rivals
With their handgun raps, man assault rifles
Boom, on the block with my weapon on my waist
Tell the lady in the shop "put some pepper on my steak"
I could either sell a tape or wrap a nigga in Sellotape
Distribute cakes, just a nigga from a council estate
I know the jakes concentrate on every move that I make
That's why I can't afford to make a mistake
That's why I'm fucking up the scene on every block, I've got them having debates
Girls singing to my songs while they're washing the plates
Think it's fair to say I came a long way
Couple years up in a prison couldn't stop me, it was just a delay
I told my nigga I was gonna go far
I had to ring him up today and ask him "yo fam, what did I say?"
Every night, I close my eyes and I pray
Saying thank you for my life and that I made it to the end of the day
I pray that all my niggas get to live my dream with me
And I swear everywhere I go, I bring the team with me

Tryna make it to the top
And I ain't never gonna stop for everyone that don't believe in me
All my niggas locked up, keep your heads held high
Every day we be praying for your freedom, G
The only one I fear's God
And I don't never walk alone so it's like I brought the priest with me
Everything I've seen has been a dream to me
And I swear everywhere I go, I bring the team with me

If we rapped the same verse, it wouldn't feel like mine
If you saw me on the rise, would you steal my shine?
If you heard I had a buj, would you boom bye bye?
If you could beat my woman, would you feel like Ike?
Or would you feel like I, or would you feel like life's
One fucked cycle until they steal your bike?
When you're just flicking through the gears, tryna catch your flight
When you reach your height, they just say you're mad like Mike
Do you stand and fight or get banged and hide?
Cause man don't cry, cause man's got pride
I'm in too deep and I can't stand no tide
Try and play Bruce Lee, you'll get a Capcom fight
Remember when I couldn't pay just to play the arcade
Now times changed, they've put my tunes on the bar game
I think first do it all for my last name
And to think I'd thought having drive was a car chase
We've all been there, got the trousers and the T-shirt
Saying life's a bitch, I'm just screaming "have you seen her?"
She put lipstick on my collar, tried to take me to the cleaners
If you just get your pre up, you won't never need a prenup
If you love 'em then they'll love you back
But if you bun 'em then they'll bun you back
You try and strike, then they'll thunderclap
Feeling like you're hit by lightning, baby mother tried
Asking you for P every week, what kind of love is that?
So everywhere I go, I bring my team with me
You're tryna be CÃ®roc boys, we're tryna P Diddy
Money makes the world go round, it's tryna spin, spin, spin
Me and Skrapz killed this, another injustice
Let them free my bros, that be a win, win, win
To the Lord we toast, just tryna cleanse our sin
Yeah, yeah

Tryna make it to the top
And I ain't never gonna stop for everyone that don't believe in me
All my niggas locked up, keep your heads held high
Every day we be praying for your freedom, G
The only one I fear's God
And I don't never walk alone so it's like I brought the priest with me
Everything I've seen has been a dream to me
And I swear everywhere I go, I bring the team with me
