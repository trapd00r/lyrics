Do ya feel me now?

[Verse1:]
Baby, can't you see, I'm calling
A guy like you, should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling

There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby give me it
Your dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Bridge:]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning around and round
Do ya feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
Your toxic I'm slippin' under
With a taste of your poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't ya know that you're toxic
And I love what ya do
But ya know that you're toxic

[Verse2:]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly It's taking over me

[Bridge]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can ya feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
Your toxic I'm slippin' under
With a taste of your poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't ya know that you're toxic
And I love what ya do
Don't ya know that you're toxic
Don't ya know that you're toxic

[Verse3:]
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your loving now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your loving now
I think I'm ready now

Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now

Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now.

[Bridge]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round

Do ya feel me now?
