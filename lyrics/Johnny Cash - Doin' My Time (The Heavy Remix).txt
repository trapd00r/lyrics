On this rock pile, with my ball and chain.
They call me by a number not a name Lord, Lord.

Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time.
With an achin' heart, on that gal of mine.

You can here my hammer, you can hear my saw.
Gonna sing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord.

Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time.
With an achin' heart, on that gal of mine.

When that old judge looked down at me.
Said I put you in that penetentiary Lord, Lord.

Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time.
With an achin' heart, on that gal of mine.

Well now it wont be long, just a few more days.
They'll let me out of here I'm gonna stay Lord, Lord.

With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine.
She's a waited for me while I've done my time.
