What kind of fool do you take me for?

I don't wanna hear your reasons
I'm not giving you another chance
In my kindness you saw weakness
Time for me to make a stand

Whenever I hear your music
Singing the same old tune
You're so sure that I can't refuse it
But don't you speak too soon

What kind of fool do you take me for
Don't wanna see your face no more
You can say you'll be true, I can trust in you
But I heard all that before

Remember how I used to need you
But baby you were never there
There was a time when I believed you
But now I know you didn't care

Don't wanna hear your hard-luck story
It's the same time after time
It's too late to say you're sorry
You'll never change wrong to right

What kind of fool do you take me for
Don't wanna see your face no more
You can say you'll be true, I can trust in you
But I heard all that before

What kind of fool do you take me for
No one on earth could give you more
You would change white to black if I took you back
But I heard all that before

What kind of fool
What kind of fool
(Believed you, believed you)
(Believed you, believed you)

Whenever I hear your music
Singing the same old tune
You're so sure that I can't refuse it
But don't you speak too soon

What kind of fool do you take me for
Don't wanna see your face no more
You can say you'll be true, I can trust in you
But I heard all that before

What kind of fool do you take me for
No one on earth could give you more
You would change white to black if I took you back
But I heard all that before

What kind of fool do you take me for
Don't wanna see your face no more
You can say you'll be true, I can trust in you
But I heard all that before
