I'm a Judeo-Christian morality with a Greco-Roman intellect
It's the way we're short-wired
It's a civilising force that demands respect
From the Baltic to the Straits of Gibraltar
A blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire, ours to build, ours the choice

I'm in a European Super State
Every citizen required to debate
I'm in a European Super State

Why are the proud descendants of Plato paying off more debts accommodating NATO?
We, the caretakers of democracy, no longer tolerate this hypocrisy
Baltic to the Straits of Gibraltar
A blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire, ours to build, ours the choice

I'm in a European Super State

I'm in a European Super State

Old Europe
Old Europe, old Europe
Old Europe
Old Europe, old Europe

I'm a Judeo-Christian morality with a Greco-Roman intellect
It's the way we're short-wired
It's a civilising force that demands respect
From the Baltic to the Straits of Gibraltar
A blue flag gold star sparks a brand new empire, ours to build, ours the choice
