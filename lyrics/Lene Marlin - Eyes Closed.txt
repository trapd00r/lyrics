She could have, when she's had a chance to miss him
She could have kissed him, and you never would have known
She could have, when he asked if there is someone else
She could have said there's no one else, and you never would have known

Her eyes are closed, all she sees is your face
All she needs is your touch, is that asking too much
She'll take you to that place,
Where nothing would feel better,
Just knowing that you're with her

She could have, when he asked to hold her hand
She could have given him her hand, and you never would have seen
What would happen if she did so,
What the ending would be like

Her eyes are closed, all she sees is your face
All she needs is your touch, is that asking too much
She'll take you to that place,
Where nothing would feel better,
Just knowing that you're with her

And in a way you're with her
In a way you never left her
But she misses you still, she misses you still

Her eyes are closed, all she sees is your face
All she needs is your touch, is that asking too much
She'll take you to that place,
Where nothing would feel better,
