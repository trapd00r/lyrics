Dr. No Dr. No can you hear what I say?
Trown me a bone 'cause I'm trying to stay sane
I'm half fried, all tied up in this bed
Give me moonshine blues from my head to my legs

Dr. No Dr. No
Dr. No Dr. No

There are sharks in the water and the water's deep
Sharks in the water and the water's deep
I prey to the Lord my soul to keep
There are sharks in the water and they're swimming in their sleep

Dr. No Dr. No I can't take no more
Dr. No Dr. No I'm on the floor
Dr. No Dr. No don't you be no swine
Lock the door give me more, don't you spin on a dime
Just do me a favour, and call it another dollar
Take me to the hollow with a flash bang wallop

Dr. No Dr. No
Dr. No Dr. No

I'm a lonely boy, I got no money in my pocket
And I'm a proud man anyway, so what of it?
Yes I can always see harm in the reckless charm of an armful
And there is only one thing that I have learnt throughout the distances we travel

And that is
There are sharks in the water and the water's deep
Sharks in the water and the water's deep
I prey to the Lord my soul to keep
There are sharks in the water and they're swimming in their sleep
