Hey-yeah, Ooh

Here's a little question to you
Baby tell me if it's gonna have an answer too
I would like to know if you could tell me boy
What's the deal and how we got up on this joint

Tell me if you wanna be with me tonight
Got a feeling you ain't ready but your heart denies
I'm not surprised
'Cause you've done this once before

Hey-yeah

I don't wanna ever have to ask you
'Cause I know you got another
'Baby, how you doing?', and I ain't gonna bother
It's not my game to deal with, do you watch eachother

There ain't no playing tonight
You see me looking, no way
Turn around unless it's something
To say to me
If you gotta go, just let me know
'Cause I am not your baby

Ooh

Baby what's the deal tonight
'Cause I know you wanted more than what you say
'Cause I feel in every move that you put on me boy
Don't act like this ain't something that your heart enjoys

But we gotta put a stop on this, boy
'Cause I ain't feeling that I have to share for you no more
I want you, baby
Need you for myself, don't want nobody else

I don't wanna ever have to ask you
'Cause I know you got another
'Baby, how you doing?', and I ain't gonna bother
It's not my game to deal with, do you watch eachother

There ain't no playing tonight
You see me looking, no way
Turn around unless it's something
To say to me
If you gotta go, just let me know
'Cause I am not your baby

You bring me high (so high)
You bring me low
Everything that you want
I know I'll get

No girl can compare
'Cause I've got what you need
And if I'm all this
I'm gonna get...

I don't wanna ever have to ask you
'Cause I know you got another
'Baby, how you doing?', and I ain't gonna bother
It's not my game to deal with, do you watch eachother

There ain't no playing tonight
You see me looking, no way
Turn around unless it's something
To say to me
If you gotta go, just let me know
'Cause I am not your baby...
