Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they hold sway over time

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day (yeah)

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
For my reputation once again

The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently
But it's all elementary, my friend

Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours, I won't get mine as well

'Cause some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day (yeah)

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
For my reputation once again

The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again
