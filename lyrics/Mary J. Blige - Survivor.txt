I been laying here, waiting for something
Realizing I'm waiting for nothing
Because I gotta get it, get it
'Cause ain't no one doing it for me
I'm the only one telling my story
And I come such a long way

From really feeling like I'm gonna lose it
Now I'm helping somebody get through it
Yeah, I feel pain but I use it
To break through the confusion
That has nothing to do with
Where I'm going 'cause I'm determined to win
There's no losing

No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit or glory to my provider
And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

They keep telling me, "Mary, it's over"
Had your run but girl, look at the numbers
Maybe you should just quit it, quit it
But I'm nearly finished the chapter
And they can't keep me from what I'm after
'Cause I come such a long way

And now I'm finally seeing me clearly
And I can work with the pain 'cause you build me
'Cause now I know how to use it
To break through the confusion
That's got nothing to do with
Where I'm going 'cause I'm determined to win
There's no losing

No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit or glory to my provider
And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

Oh, I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor, oh
I'm on my way, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nothing's gonna stop me, no, no, no, no
I paved the way, woah
For so many to break free
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
No matter how hard, I'ma still keep my light up
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
No matter how hard, I'ma shine even brighter

No, that can't be
Heart of a fighter, so no, you can't break me
Lock me out if you wanna
Already found the key
You can try but don't be surprised 'cause
I'm a survivor
No matter how low I go, I'm gonna rise up
And I can't take the credit or glory to my provider
And I'm burning so bright, you can't put out my fire
So there ain't nothing realer that can stop me, I'm a survivor

Yeah, yeah, yeah
