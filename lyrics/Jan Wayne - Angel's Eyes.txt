On a cold and lonely morning
Rain clouds over my head
Gloomy memories in mind
No way seems to lead out

Then suddenly a shine came through
Rainbow high in the sky
There he was dressed in blue
I never had a doubt

When i looked into angel's eyes
My heart started burning
When i looked into angel's eyes
My mind got yearing

When i looked into angel's eyes
My heart started burning
When i looked into angel's eyes
The world began turning

His black hair blowing in the wind
Oh what a sunny smile
He took me by the hand and he said
Come with me to the stars

Still today i thing about
What happened on that day
I never can forget his eyes
For us their was no way
