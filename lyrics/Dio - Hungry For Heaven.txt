You're a dancer but you're dancing on air
Just a matter of time till you fall
You're a dreamer, one night at the fair
But still you want it all
You're in danger, the last of a line
But the vision lasts forever

So just hold on
You can make it happen for you
Reach for the stars and you will fly

You're hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
But you need a little help

You're a runner but you're chasing yourself
Feel the hot breath on your shoulder
You're emotion, running cold, running warm
The young just getting older
We are sunlight, we can sparkle and shine
And our dreams are what we're made of

Oh just hold on
You can make it happen for you
Reach for the stars and you will fly

You're hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
But you need a little help

Oh hungry

You're hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
You're hungry for heaven
Oh hungry for heaven
So hungry for heaven
You're hungry for heaven

You're a dancer but you're dancing on air
You're a dreamer, one night at the fair
You're hungry, hungry than for heaven
You're a rider in the night
Just a dreamer but that's all right
You're hungry, hungry for heaven

Hungry
Hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
Hungry for heaven
