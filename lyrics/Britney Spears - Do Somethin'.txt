Do you feel this
I'm gonna feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so

Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like

Come, somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spent the cash like

What you gonna do when the crowd goes "Ey-o!"
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don't you just move along?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Now you all in my grill  
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rock to what's real
(Bum, bum)

But I can't do that with you
I'll be here with my crew  
You can roll if you can
Don't be a (Bum, bum)

What you gonna do when the crowd goes "Ey-o!"
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don't you just move along?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Aha

I see you looking over here
Can't you tell I'm having fun?
If you know it like I know

You, what's up?
Staring at us
Hey, get your own space
And do something

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?

Say
Do somethin'
Ow!
Why don't you do somethin'?
