Keep on hanging on
Stuck here till I'm gone
Boys still throwing songs
Running till I'm wrong

I never listened to tell the truth
I never knew
But nobody misses what you did
Quite like I do

Got me thinking 'bout it all day long
(Till we're dead and gone)
All day long
(Till we're dead and gone)

Banging my head against the wall
All day long
Banging my head against the wall
Dead and gone

But I'm seeing a pattern
Falling from a ladder
Must be tripping like a cartoon
Slipping on a banana

Looked up in the sun
Burned out but I ain't done
Ice cream melting down
Dripping on the ground

Young black and gifted
Never lose, gotta be the shoes
That old money privilege
Got me confused, what is it you do

Got me thinking 'bout it all day long
(Banging my head against the wall)
All day long
(Banging my head against the wall)
All day long
(Banging my head against the wall)
All day long
And it's all and it's all and it's all day long
Till we're dead and gone

Maybe I'm trippin' to tell the truth
Don't have a clue
(Maybe you're not alone, that's right)
Maybe I missed out on my youth
Playing it cool

Man in the mirror like
Grow up, be a winner
Blow up, be a winner

All day long, till we're dead and gone
(Be a winner)
All day long, till we're dead and gone
(Grow up, be a winner)
All day long, till we're dead and gone

Banging my head against the wall
All day long
And it's all and it's all and it's all day long
Banging my head against the wall

Till we're dead and gone
And it's all day long till we're dead and gone
Banging my head against the wall
