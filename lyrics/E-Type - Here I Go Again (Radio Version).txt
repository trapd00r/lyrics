Here I go again
it's time for me to fade away
Here I go

Here I go

It's time again to let the storm rise
and I'm waiting here with great expectations and I know
You call it what you want
but for now I'm standing tall
and I'm here to get it all
give me your best shot or go

(Bridge:)
You gotta move on
you better believe it
And you'll find out this is the time of your life
You gotta move on
you better believe it
You can be sure this is the ride of your life

(Chorus:)
Here I go again, it's time for me to fade away
I'm out of here I go again, I've lost the game
And no one is to blame
Here I go again, it's time for me to fade away
I'm out of here I go again, I've lost the game
And no one is to blame
Here I go

So time waits for no one and I only get a chance
to be on top of the world and you know
If you want to move on
you will have to be strong
cause it won't last long
you will reap what you sow

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

So time is running out I feel I have to let you go
And I know

No one is to blame

Here I go, here I go
Here I go again, baby
Here I go, here I go
Here I go again, baby

(Chorus)
