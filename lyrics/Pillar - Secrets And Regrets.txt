No matter how hard you try to
You can't make the clock rewind to
The moment that you lied to yourself
It never really mattered how they felt

Your secrets and regrets
Are keeping you from going very far
And you can't let all this get you down
And keep you living in the dark

'Cause all you're looking for is love
You're living in the dark
You just can't get enough
Your secrets and regrets

You're holding on this pain inside you
Can't seem to leave it all behind you
Tomorrow it'll be today soon
Don't wait until it's too late to move

Your secrets and regrets
Are keeping you from going very far
And you can't let all this get you down
And keep you living in the dark

'Cause all you're looking for is love
You're living in the dark
You just can't get enough
Your secrets and regrets

How many times do you need second chances?
Not everybody gets a another second chance
How many times do you need second chances?
Not everybody gets another second chance, second chance

Your secrets and regrets
Are keeping you from going very far
And you can't let all this get you down
And keep you living in the dark

'Cause all you're looking for is love
You're living in the dark
You just can't get enough
Your secrets and regrets

It's no more secrets, no regrets
It's no more secrets, no regrets
No living in the dark, no living in the dark
No living in the dark, no living in the dark
