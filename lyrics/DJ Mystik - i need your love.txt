I need, I need your love, like the flowers need the sun
To grow and reach the sky. Let us try to be as one
I need to feel your love, I need you deep inside
Put me on your rocket ship, and take me out of sight

I see stars
Can you see them too?
I see stars
Can you see them?
I see stars
Can you see them too?
I see stars
Can you see them?

I need, I need your love, like the flowers need the sun
To grow and reach the sky. Let us try to be as one
I need to feel your love, I need you deep inside
Put me on your rocket ship, and take me out of sight

I see stars
Can you see them too?
