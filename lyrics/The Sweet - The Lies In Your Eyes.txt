Ain't nobody gonna take my place
Whips and chains don't leave no trace
Solid gold brass got a plastic face, ah...
You break me up every time you try
To cool me off with a wink of your eye
And I don't eat humble pie in the sky, no more

I can see, you ain't foolin' me
I ain't blind
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
The tears that you cry, I'm not blind
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
But the lies in your eyes

You've got a big fat mouth, watch what you say
Cause sooner (later) you're gonna pay
Gone tomorrow, here today
There ain't nobody gonna take my place
Sticks and stones don't leave no trace
I don't need your second face

I can see, you ain't foolin' me
I ain't blind
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
The tears that you cry, I'm not blind
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
But the lies in your eyes

I can see, I can see, I can see (pie in the sky)
I can see (pie in the sky, high, high)

Don't you know I can see, you ain't foolin' me
I ain't blind
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
The tears that you cry, I'm not blind
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
The lies in your eyes don't disguise
But the lies in your eyes
