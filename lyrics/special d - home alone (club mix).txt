Today is the day
School's out we're on holiday
Mom and dad are not at home
It's partytime I'm home alone
'ask all my friends to come
'shake their bums and have some fun
The party is over here
So'.(MC: put your hands in the air) x2

All the ladies all around
Getting jiggy on that sound
So guys get on the floor
Take a drink and rock some more
The neighboars cannot sleep
'cause that stompin'n'pumpin beat
The temperature is high
Special D. makes you fly
