Just cry
You don't have to hide it from me
Rely on me
Just cry
Even if you don't know why
Rely on me

Chorus
That's what you said, but I don't know
I'm walking here so all alone
I wanna hear your voice right now
I'm looking for it all around
I really need to find a payphone

Just smile
You don't have to hide it from me
Come dance with me
Just smile
Even if you don't know why
Come dance with me

Chorus

I know you can't smile those tears away
I know you can't smile those tears away

Chorus
