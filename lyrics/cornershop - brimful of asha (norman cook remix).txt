There's dancing
Behind movie scenes
Behind the movie scenes
Sadi rani
She's the one that keeps the dream alive
From the morning
Past the evening
To the end of the light

Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five

And dancing
Behind movie scenes
Behind those movie screens
Asha Bhosle
She's the one that keeps the dream alive
From the morning
Past the evening
To the end of the light

Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five

Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Mine's on the forty five

And singing
Illuminate the main streets
And the cinema aisles
We don't care about no
Government warning
'Bout their promotion of the simple life
And the dams they're building

Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five

Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom

Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Mine's on the forty five

Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five

Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
Everybody needs a bosom

And singing, and dancing
And singing, and dancing
And singing, and dancing
And singing, and dancing

And dancing, and dancing
And dancing, and dancing
And dancing, and dancing
And dancing, and dancing
Mine's on the RPM
