BOTH: We got married in a fever hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' 'bout Jackson
JOHNNY: Ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around (yeah?)
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson, look out Jackson town

JUNE: Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health (hmm)
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, yeah, go to Jackson, but go comb that hair
JOHNNY: I'm gonna snowball Jackson
JUNE: Go ahead and see if I care

JOHNNY: When I breeze inta that city, the people gonna stoop and bow (ha ha)
All them women gonna make me teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, ya turn-a loose-a my coat
'cause I'm goin' to Jackson
JUNE: Goodbye, that's all she wrote

JUNE: They'll laugh at you in Jackson (I doubt it)
And I'll be dancin' on a pony keg
They'll lead you 'round that town like a scalded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' there in Jackson behind my *Japan* fan

BOTH: We got married in a fever hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' 'bout Jackson ever since the fire went ou-ou-out
Go to Jackson and that's a natural fact
We're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back

BOTH: We got married in a fever hotter than a pepper sprout
FADE
We been talkin' 'bout Jackson
