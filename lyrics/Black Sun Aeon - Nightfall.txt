Last ray of the light
Sole spark of the sun
Final and so fragile
Travelled from afar

Now standing in a shade
Shadowed by the moon
The eclipse is complete
Dead cold space high above me

Embraced by the nightfall
The darkness came to me
Without descent of the sun

Before the flames shall return
And ablaze the sky on fire
I will hide myself
In the shade of the moon

The veil of the night
The sparks of the sun
So vital and fragile
Can't reach this far

Standing in a shade
Shadowed by the moon
Darkness is complete
Dead cold space all around me

I am waiting and yearning
For darkness to remain and prevail
