I used to be so fearless, so limitless and free
Happy on my own and nothing really bothered me
I had desires to see the world, jump out of planes and fly
I loved to be alive, but I was not afraid to die
I loved to be alive but I was not afraid to die...

I used to be so sure of things and self contained
I could carry on with no need to explain
It didn't matter if I ever made it home
Could go too fast, drink all night and dance alone
I loved to be alive but I was not afraid to die
I loved to be alive but I was not afraid to die

Since I met you, I've got everything to lose
Since I met you, I've got everything to lose

I used to be so thoughtless so easy and free
Could walk away, not think ahead and had no plans to keep
No hand to hold no one to bring down with me
I wouldn't see the worst and it only hurts me
I loved to be alive but I was not afraid to die

Since I met you, I've got everything to lose
Since I met you I've got everything to lose
