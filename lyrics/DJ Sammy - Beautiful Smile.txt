My love is like a turing wheel
it is spinning, spinning around
Waking up see your beautiful smile
I know every second counts
My love is like a turning wheel
it is spinng spinng around
Sunny days and i call your name
I'd do anything, just for your love
[x2]

Just for your love [x2]

And if I stumble
And if I fall
Will you help me?
Help me back on the ground
When im confused
And afraid of the dark
Will you hold me tight, and show me all of your love?

(If I Fall)

My love is like a turing wheel
it is spinning, spinning around
Waking up see your beautiful smile
I know every second counts
My love is like a turning wheel
it is spinng spinng around
Sunny days and i call your name
I'd do anything, just for your love
