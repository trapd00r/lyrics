This young girl, she's a freak
She's up clubbing every night of the weekend
All around town it's the same old sound
Spread that fever, let us all get down

This young girl, she's a freak
She's up clubbing every night of the weekend
All around the town it's the same old sound
Spread that fever, (Show it!) let us all get down

She loves the late night in the city action
To be the center of attraction, gifts of satisfaction
She wants your reaction (Hey!)
Watcha think her bottom weighs
Is it okay, or is it going late?
Stop with you lies 'n open your eyes
This is to be the last sin instead of vandalisin
This young girl put you in the zone
To dance rule it's the second flow
So just let it role

All around the town it's the same old sound

I like latin freaks who like hardcore beats,
hangin out in the streets, some boys that wont sleep
Crash a joint, let it all out, that's the last dance
Crane built, too much spending money talking about true romance
I like that low cut waistline, see through panties always corrupt my mind
I am what I am and I hope you like me too
The most beautiful thing in the world is a girl and that's true
Slink, skinny, high heels is my passion
Anything goes from street clothes to the latest french fashion
I got your back, say no more
Bad girls like it raw (Uh!)

She's not even fifteen but looks older than nineteen
So what they mean, the thought in every man's wet dreams
Straight VIP, never tried a line, she can toss the game
Heard that every bastard knows her name
Pull'n all nighters, here we got war fighters
From gypsies, call girls start poets with some writers
Plus she did things with her tongue
That leave ya outta breath (hu!)
Told ya (hu!), she was under twentyone

Two, three, down on the four
Sex in the city, hot like never before
This kiddie, swings both ways, never settle for less
Ladies and gents, welcome to the funkfest

This young girl, she's a freak
She's up clubbing every night of the weekend
All around town it's the same old sound
