So many times
I've been watching you
And now I fell
In love with you
So many times
So many times...

You go out every night
Tryin' to find the perfect love
You've lost the faith in yourself
You're falling out in loneliness
The world is full of magic can't you see?
I'm your guardian angel, trust in me
So many times I've been watchin'you
And now I fell in love with you

So many times
I've been watching you
And now I fell
In love with you
So many times
So many times...

...And now I feel
In love with you

So many times
I've been watchin'you
And now I fell
In love with you
(2x)

Do your heart feels so lonely?
Think about your sweetest dream
Close your eyes and follow me
And I'll take you to my destiny
I'm thinking about you all the time
When I keep my love to you that's a crime

So many times
I've been watchin'you
And now I fell
In love with you

So many times
I've been watching you
And now I fell
In love with you
So many times
So many times...

So many times
I've been watchin'you
And now I fell
In love with you
