A million miles away from home
I feel sick and I feel torn
I've got a picture in my mind
Of all these things I've left behind

It's just another hotel motel
And a six-pack in my head
I keep talking to that picture
But everything just won't talk back

Now I wish that you could hear me
You're always on my mind
I feel bad leaving you behind

Hell I've got promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
I think of you and while I wheep
A million miles to go

The worn out picture in my head
The only blanket in my bed
I'm sweating blood that taste like tears
Your voice so sadly in my ear

Now I wish that you could hear me
You're always on my mind
I feel bad leaving you behind

Hell I've got promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
I think of you and while I wheep
A million miles to go

I've got promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
I think of you and while I wheep
A million miles to go

Now I wish that you could hear me
You're always on my mind
I feel bad leaving you behind

And I've got promises to keep
Miles to go before I sleep
And I've got promises to keep
Miles to go before I sleep
Think of you and while I weep
Million miles to go

Hell I've got promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
I think of you and while I wheep
A million miles to go

Hell I've got promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
I think of you and while I wheep
A million miles to go
