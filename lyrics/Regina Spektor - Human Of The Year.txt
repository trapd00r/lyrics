Hello, hello
Calling a Karl Projektorinski to the front
Of the cathedral, you have won
Dear sir
May I congratulate you first?
Oh, what an honor

Human!
Human of the year!
You've won!
Human!
Human of the year!
You've won!

Why are you so scared?
You stand there shaking in your pew
The icons are whispering to you
They're just old men
Like on the benches in the park
Except their balding spots are
Glistening with gold

Human!
Human of the year!
You've won!
Human!
Human of the year!
You've won!
Won
On
On
You have won!

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Outside the cars are beepin'
Out a song just in your honor
And though they do not know it
All mankind are now your brothers

And thus the cathedral had spoken
Wishing well to all us sinners
And, with a sigh, grew silent
Till next year's big human winner

Outside the cars are beepin'
Out a song just in your honor
And though they do not know it
All mankind are now your brothers
All mankind are now your brothers

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Hello, hello
Calling a Karl Projektorinski to the front
Of the cathedral
You have won!
