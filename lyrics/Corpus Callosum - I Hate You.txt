We moving we moving
Stop you ran over cuz
We do this we do this
Take the game over cuz
We moving we moving
Stop you ran over cuz
We do this we do this
Take the game over cuz
We ruthless we ruthless
Slay the fakes flowing blood
Blazing tapes get only love
Hate to say I told you cuz

[Thoughtz]

Rocking like a seizure patient pleasing faces
Resuppose our life in sequence been through recent stages
To redefine ourselves leaves us ageless
We're predisposed to greed
Our graces lead us places where we bleed
We need to read the basics
Cuz I don't see the basis
Of half these legislative lies that lead us lazy league of haters
See the latest in the news near you
It's a two tier rule
Bottom or top, weak or strong
Pick a side, you don't get choose
Be silent n rot and hope the violence could stop
All the while a tyrant atop a throne smiling
The games violent insane
Where cats would die for a name
Off the chain constant the flame
Cooking these rappers I chomp on they frame
I feed off wackness, snack on their beings
Leave a path of these weaklings while I laugh undefeated
They Throwing up white flags and offering contractual agreements
In hopes I won't be back for a beating
Get taxed for the evening like snatch
Never say we're practically even
Or get tactically beat after the match hand you ya hat
Which is what I was catching ya teeth in
I thought you'd naturally keep 'em
I'm actually speaking flames like dragons are breathing ya frame
Get charred n tattered for treason
Sometimes with no actual reason

We moving we moving
Stop you ran over cuz
We do this we do this
Take the game over cuz
We ruthless we ruthless
Slay the fakes flowing blood
Blazing tapes get only love
Hate to say I told you cuz

[Coal Cash]

I hate to say I told you so
We break the mold and stole the show
Put a hole in a snake's face
Illuminate space with a solar glow
Flow with an innate grace
My pace chased by light speed
Exceeding degrees of might to all new heights when my flight leave
Incite leagues of lunacy
Imbued with doom's impunity
Inhumanly stay consumed in rubber-rooms after a shrooming spree
Free from my cocoon I hewn monoliths of my dominance
With the prominence of God compare my squad with how a comet hits
An onimous barrage you couldn't dodge the jihad genocide
Gentrified genders with senseless pretenders making an attempt to hide
And menticide contenders til they remember only the words I say
Til the way that they react will have my back like 33 vertebrae
A murdering slay with flawlessness, lawlessness leaking off of this
I'm Morpheus anamorphic warping the thoughts of what the portrait is
Of course the most awesomest force of the mind mending contortionist
I'll finish lines like Boston, while you finish lines like the abortion did
I'm coursing with endorphines throughout your corpus callosum
I stay roasting your pineal gland until you fall to convulsions
Ain't no hope for your feeble plan
Your weasel fam gets their cerebrals jammed
Looking like Sm√©agol shooting needles in their adrenal gland
