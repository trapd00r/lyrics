Boy you know you make me float
Boy you're really gettin' me high
I feel like I'm on dope
'Cause you, you serve me on a regular
Boy we need to tie this rope
Before we drift any deeper
Baby now hold me close
Let's take this over board now

I want you to
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, switch positions, new position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Ooh baby I love your stroke
'Cause you, 'cos you get me where I'm going
In jury you'll get my vote
'Cos I believe, I believe you know just what you doing now
Baby now we can coast, let's don't get in a hurry
That's too slow, go ahead and put that thing in overdrive

I want you to
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, switch positions, new position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me

I want you to
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, switch positions, new position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Stroke it for me
Stroke it baby, stroke it baby
Work it baby, work it baby
Stroke it

There is something I want you to do
I want you to use yourself
Like you never ever used it before
To explore my body
Until you reach the shore 
I'll be calling, calling for more 

I want you to
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, switch positions, new position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me

I want you to
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, switch positions, new position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me

I want you to
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, switch positions, new position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me

(Rock the boat)
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
