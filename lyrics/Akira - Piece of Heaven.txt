The minute you walked through my door
I know this love is forever more
But then you told my all these lies
See the tears filling up my eyes

All I want is a little piece of heaven
All I need a little piece of heaven
All I want is a little piece of heaven
All I need a little piece of heaven


You tought me right from wrong
And showed me always to be strong
But now I'm better of alone
Searching for a better home

All I want is a little piece of heaven
All I need a little piece of heaven
All I want is a little piece of heaven
All I need a little piece of heaven


Piece of heaven
Piece of heaven

Piece of heaven
