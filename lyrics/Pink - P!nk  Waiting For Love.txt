She looks to the sun 
Help her to carry on 
Breaking down all the years
Wondering how she got here 

She drifts through the sky
Counting the reasons why 
How my life turns so fast 
Remembering all of the past

All the changes and all the mistakes 
Foolishly laughing at things that 
Words that she said 
She looks to the stars 
Breaking time to follow the heart
Her world is falling apart

And the turning of every new page
A book on a shelf that is there to remain 
Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down 
As she is starting to drown 

[Chorus]
She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting too long

She prays to the gods
Telling how she needs someone 
Help me find where I am today 
Life is looking very gray 

All the changes and all the mistakes 
Foolishly laughing at things that 
Everything that she says 

[Chorus]

I'm waiting for a new day to rise 
Conversations to make sense to me in my mind
I need someone to lift me right up from my feet 
And I want it, and I need it 
And I ?

And all the changes I've made 
And I remember the words that you never say 

[Chorus]

She looks to the sun
