Move slow
Now your times at hand
Take Heed
Cause our love has passed
Hot Fuse
Can be short or long
The time bomb of your
Life has come

People may come
People may go
Just as long as the waters slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

Dry land is just a love away
Warm Sun and a place to lay
I see your future
The water above you calm and clear

People may come
People may go
Just as long as the waters slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

Love lost always makes one sad
You seem to rise instead
Feel the water, ice cool water

People may come
People may go
Just as long as the waters slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall
The waterfall
