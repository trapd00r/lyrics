I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

Three miles of cars layin' on their horns
Fallin' on deaf ears of corn
Lined up behind me like a big parade
Of late to work road raged jerks
Shoutin' obscene words
Flippin' me the bird

Well you may be on a state paved road
But that blacktop runs through my payload
Excuse me for tryin' to do my job
But this year ain't been no bumper crop

If you don't like the way I'm a drivin'
Get back on the interstate
Otherwise, sit tight and be nice
And quit your honkin' at me that way

I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A

Hey!
That's a what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

Well I know you got your own deadlines
But cussin' at me won't save you no time, hoss
This big-wheeled wide load ain't goin' any faster
So just smile and wave and tip your hat
To the man up on the tractor

Cause I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I've got two boys in the county 4-H
I'm a lifetime sponsor of the F.F.A

Hey!
That's a what I make
I make a lot of hay for a little pay
But I'm proud to say

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester

I'm a God fearin', hardworkin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road with my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my international harvester
