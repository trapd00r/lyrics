I come over here...
For professional reasons, nothing else.
On a professional mission.
I've gotta get a team together
I've gotta hand pick a team
I had you in mind for that team.
But quite frankly your attitude appals me,
It's not what you're saying, it's all the stuff you're not saying.
Insinuendoes.

You really are demonstrating a whopping great ego, my friend.
Now keep that ??? of you
That sort of big-headedness can be a right turn-off!
Now if no one do the job, fair enough, I'm gonna take that and believe in it.
And considering what I know about your damn outrageousness of what's going on inside your head,
Whatever stinking thoughts you're having, we can go without!
'Cause they're disgusting!
