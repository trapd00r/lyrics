By the way every little thing about her face
Fills him up the image so pleasing it could never be erased
Here to stay embedded in his mind he wishes they could be together
All the time

By the way she says things the tone just to hear her voice
He can't explain the sound so exciting to him a perfect choice
Here to stay embedded in his mind he wishes they could be together
All the time

A crazy independent, Spanish speaking, arty flirty, red wine drinking,
Sexy tomboy with a natural way of
Thinking carefree, yeah
Innocent she's slightly sneaky
Confidently proud from another country
Has her way, lives for today
By the way she's far away

By the way, holding her, hugging her can feel so warm
Just think about it, two bodies embracing, creating love in this form
Here to stay, mmm, embedded in his mind, he wishes they could be together
All the time

A crazy independent, Spanish speaking, arty flirty, red wine drinking,
Sexy tomboy with a natural way of
Thinking crazy 

Then she kissed him and she went away
Far across to San Francisco Bay
You'd think that she would think again
And only want to be with him
Regardless of the things that pull her
Far away, she's far away 

A crazy independent, Spanish speaking, arty flirty, red wine drinking,
Sexy tomboy with a natural way of
Thinking crazy
By the way, she's far away and by the way she's far away, yeah 

A crazy independent, Spanish speaking, arty flirty, red wine drinking
By the way she's far away, yeah
Ooh, far away, ah
A crazy independent, Spanish speaking, arty flirty, red wine drinking
