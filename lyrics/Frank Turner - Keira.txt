Lay you down tonight
Under butterflies
Put my headphones on
I'll see you at the dawn

Life for you is a better view
So simple and perfectly sane
If I pretend that you have a god
I know you'll be saved

Hey, hey

Build a wall for you
So no one can get through
We'll sleep away the day
I'm gone when you awake

Maybe I'm no good at this
But here's the one thing that I know
Think of this as a lullaby
To listen when I go

No, no
No, no
No, no
No, no
