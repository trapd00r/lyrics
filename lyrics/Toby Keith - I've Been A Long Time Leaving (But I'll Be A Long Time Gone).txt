Well, I woke up this mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Around the curve come a passenger train
Heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
Hey, Jimmy, he dead, he been a long time gone
He been a long time gone
A long time gone

If you wanna get to Heaven, gotta D-I-E
You gotta put on your coat and T-I-E
You wanna get the rabbit out the L-O-G
You gotta make a cold motion like a D-O-G
Yeah, like a D-O-G
Like a D-O-G

I got a good woman, what's the matter with me?
What makes me wanna love every woman I see?
I was triflin' when I met her, now I'm triflin' again
Every woman, she see look like a place I came in
Look like a place I came in
Place I came in

Well, I got my name painted on my shirt
I ain't no ordinary dude, I don't have to work
I don't have to work
I don't have to work

Hey
Oh

I woke up this mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
'Round the curve come a passenger train
Heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
I said, Jimmy, he dead, been a long time gone
He been a long time gone
Yeah, long time gone

And if you wanna get to Heaven, gotta D-I-E
Man, you gotta put on your coat and T-I-E
You wanna get the rabbit out the L-O-G
Gonna make a cold motion like a D-O-G
Like a D-O-G
Yeah, like a D-O-G

How's it been, you all?
