[Chorus]
Ay yo fuck y'all niggaz
(Man fuck you too)
Ay yo fuck y'all niggaz
(Man fuck you too)

It's big dog baby
Gettin down like what
See I'm a thorough bread
I don't fuck wit much
Bloodline is
Where the pups at
They off the Grand Champ
Yea what black
Don't nothin move less
Dog say so
Cats clueless
About the way it go
Off the chain I got
At least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill
Cuz they feel dog
I can't help what it is
Shit is real dog
You must have thought that
It was a joke or somethin
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin
Now hold up playa
Cuz I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit
Cuz I don't say no names
See what I know I'm taking
To the fuckin grave
So keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin thing

[Chorus x4]

Ay yo
Who we be was off the last joint
But now it's who we see
And we forget the last joint
Cats ain't never walked like X
Even before coochie rapper talked like sex
I've been around since at least 83
So ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin me
Cuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone
And other cats is on
Another batch is born
Don't give a fuck
Bout none of y'all
Fuck each and every one of y'all
Cuz I done done it all
Been where ya at
Been where ya goin
Then brought it back
I tried to tell ya bout it
But you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood
Cuz the hood will listen
I wish you woulda listened
Cuz then you woulda known
That it's only right
To give a dog a bone
Bitch

[Chorus x2]

Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand
When a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man
Nigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
In to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast
That's the lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door
Shhh chill
You sit right there
I'm gonna answer that
Cuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back

[Chorus x4]

Fuck it
