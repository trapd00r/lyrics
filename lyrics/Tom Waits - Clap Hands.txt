Sane, sane, they're all insane
Fireman's blind, the conductor is lame
A Cincinnati jacket and a sad-luck dame
Hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain

Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands

Said roar, roar, the thunder and the roar
Son'bitch is never coming back here no more
The moon in the window and a bird on the pole
We can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal

Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands
Clap hands

Said steam, steam, a hundred bad dreams
Going up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty dollar bill inside a paladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at

Roar, roar, the thunder and the roar
Son'bitch is never coming back here no more

I said steam, steam, a hundred bad dreams
Going up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty dollar bill inside a paladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at

Shine, shine, a Roosevelt dime
All the way to Baltimore and running out of time
Salvation Army seemed to wind up in the hole
They all went to heaven in a little rowboat
