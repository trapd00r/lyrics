Another crystal grin
To make up for the dark skies
Put on my best dress so the mess
Won't touch my little insides
Did you think I'd still be greener
Than the weed inside your glass pipe?
Greener than the vomit on your shirt

Dreaming of a lady strangling a flower
A pretend park with pretend children
In your pretend sight
My love was waiting open armed and close hearted
Still out there with his setting sun

-And if I could just
Fall too soon
I still wouldn't get there quick enough
Waiting, waiting...
There still wouldn't be no one waiting around
But I'll get myself there anyhow-

I cup the silence
So your whisper can be seen
Just me and kim marie
Were braiding eyes and thoughts and memories
Can't put my finger on the way you taste
Or what's your face
Or... what was that you told me with a sigh?

Why put that dream in your scream?
Why tell me to fuck off?
Put the past in the sugar bowl
Make it all a little creamier...

If I could just...
Fall too soon...
