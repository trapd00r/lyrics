It makes no difference where I turn
I can't get over you and the flame still burns
It makes no difference, night or day
The shadow never seems to fade away

And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door

Now there's no love
As true as the love
Right there in Heaven above
But the clouds never hung so low before

It makes no difference how far I go
Like a scar that will always show
It makes no difference who I meet
It's just a face in the crowd on a dead end street

And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door

These old love letters
Well, I just can't keep
Just like the gambler says:
"Find read 'em and weep"
In the dawn don't rescue me no more

And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains, they fall down on my door

One more time now

And the sun don't shine anymore
And the rains fall down on my door
