Tell me, tell me what you see 
When you close your amber eyes 
When the sparkle fades away 
And what remains of you is just a child 

Tell me, tell me what you miss 
When you melt in my embrace 
When your sky explodes so bright 
And all the cracks within reveal themselves 

You only are to me 
What I can make of you 
From day to day I chase 
An ever changing view. 

Tell me, tell me what it is 
That you leave outside the door 
When you come back late at night 
Wearing touch - proof skin beneath your coat 

You're a star I want to catch 
You're a ship I want to sink 
But I only pass you by 
And when I get too close you disappear 

So tell me, tell me, tell me
