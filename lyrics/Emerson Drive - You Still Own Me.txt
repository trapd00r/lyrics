I put a "For Sale" sign on the front of my truck
Said, "Call any time, I'm always up"
Make an offer
One that I won't refuse

I bought a one-way ticket on a westbound plane
4 hours later
I was wearing shades in California
Yeah, just hanging loose

I didn't pack one memory
And even though I breathe

I can go where I wanna go,
Do what I wanna do,
Be who I wanna be,
But baby
You still own me

Say what I wanna say,
Hear what I wanna hear,
Dream what I wanna dream,
But baby
You still own me

I was up all night
'Cause I couldn't sleep
Instead of staring at the ceiling
I hit the beach, took a long walk
It didn't help me much

I sat down in the sand
With a handful of shells
Kicked off my shoes
While me, myself, and I watched the sun come up

Looking out across the sea,
Oh, it finally dawned on me

I can go where I wanna go,
Do what I wanna do,
Be who I wanna be,
But baby
You still own me

Say what I wanna say,
Hear what I wanna hear,
Dream what I wanna dream,
But baby
You still own me

Baby I'm not in your arms
You still own me
But you're still in my heart

I can go where I wanna go,
Do what I wanna do,
Be who I wanna be,
But baby
You still own me

Say what I wanna say,
Hear what I wanna hear,
Dream what I wanna dream,
But baby
You still own me

Oh yeah... alright
You still own me.
