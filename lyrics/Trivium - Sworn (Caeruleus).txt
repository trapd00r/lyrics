Sworn to fight evils of night
Clad in black legions attack

Storming castle stealing life
Retribution fill my veins
Nothing left but fire

This is the end of life
So say your prayers
This is the end of life
So say your prayers

(Prayers) can't take the pain away
Dressed in night hope angels still prey
