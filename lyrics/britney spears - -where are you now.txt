This time i was there,ok.
Dont you know me enought of this fool.
Fool me anymore inside of me?
Did you thought that i was there.
Did you thought that i wasnt there.
Did you ever thought that i promiss me?
Come on and tell me?
Get it (whoooooooa)
Get it (whooooooooooa)
No More
Get it (whoooooooooooooooooooooooa)
Get it (whooooooooooooooooooooooooooa)

No More
No More
