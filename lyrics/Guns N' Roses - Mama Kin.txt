My mama said
That your life is a gift
And my mama said
Theres much weight you will lift
And my mama said
Leave those bad boys alone
And my mama said
Be home before the dawn
And my mama said
You can be rich or poor
But my mama said
You can be big or small

But Im always on the run

My mama said
That its good to be truthful
But my mama said
Dont take more than a mouthful
And my mama said
That its good to be natural
And my mama said
That its good to be factual

But Im always on the run

My mama said
Baby dont ride that crazy horse
And my mama said
You must push with much force
And my mama said
Go get all that your after
And my mama said
That loves all that matters

But Im always on the run
