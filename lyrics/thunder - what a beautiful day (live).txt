It was just a winter's morning
Waling in the Human Race
Hurrying up going nowhere baby
And then I saw her face
In the chaos around us
I don't know how I caught her eye
But in the spae of a heartbeat
She began to smile

I could se the storm clouds gathering above me
I felt the wind as it started to howl
And it rained like the sky was crying
But all I could say was what a beautiful day

Overloading my senses
She was in heavenly light
just the kind of a moment
That lasts you a life, that's why

I could se the storm clouds gathering above me
I felt the wind as it started to howl
And it rained like the sky was crying
But all I could say was what a beautiful day

I'll remember the feeling till I die
Time was standing still
I was flying high, so high

I could se the storm clouds gathering above me
I felt the wind as it started to howl
And it rained like the sky was crying
What a beautifulday, what a beautiful day

And it riained like the sky was crying
But all I could say was what a beautiful day
