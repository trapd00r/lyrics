Uh, oh, uh, oh

Every night I go
Every night I go
Sneaking out the door
I lie a little more
Baby I'm a helpless

There's something 'bout the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me

What would my mama do? (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
If she knew about me and you (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
What would my daddy say? (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
If he saw me hurt this way (Uh, oh, uh, oh)

(Uh, oh, uh, oh)

Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
Here we are again
It's really perfect

What would my mama do? (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
If she knew about me and you (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
What would my daddy say? (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
If he saw me hurt this way (Uh, oh, uh, oh)

(Whoo) What would mama do?
(Whoo) Uh, Oh
(Whoo) What would my daddy say?
(Whoo)

All the things a girl should know
All the things she can't control
All the things a girl should know
She can't control

What would my mama do? (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
If she knew about me and you (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
What would my daddy say? (Uh, oh, uh, oh)
If he saw me hurt this way (Uh, oh, uh, oh)

Uh, oh, uh, oh
Uh, oh, uh, oh
Uh, oh, uh, oh
