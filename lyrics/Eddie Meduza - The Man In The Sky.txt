The hard times are reigning
The world is in pain
The kings and the captains they all conquer in vain
I stand in the background
Just watching the scene
I'm doing my best to keep my hands washed and clean

The questions are rising
Are drifting like snow
If you never get no answer you'll never know
The more I did wonder
The less I did care
When one day suddenly the answer was there

I heard the man in the sky
He was talking right to me
He said it's very simple
This is how it's gonna be
Your life is your own business
You can even cheat and lie
But you never can count away the man in the sky

I could hear him talking
Tho' he didn't speak
I just understood that I am strong when I'm weak
'Cause man was created
To work all alone
The answer is written in the soul of your own

I heard the man in the sky
He was talking right to me
He said it's very simple
This is how it's gonna be
Your life is your own business
You can even cheat and lie
But you never can count away the man in the sky

So live your life as you please
And let your mind command
'Cause when it really comes down to it you are just a man
The only thing you know for sure
Is that you're gonna die
So you can never count away the man in the sky

The only thing you know for sure
Is that you're gonna die
So you can never count away the man in the sky
