Well, I sit and hear sentimental footsteps
And then a voice say "hi, so?
So what you got? What you got this time?
Come on, let's get high
Come on, Lexxo what you got next-o?
Walking 25 miles-o?
Well, I'm bored, I'm bored
C'mon, let's get high!

Come on, let's get high!
Come on, let's get high!
High!"

Well, I found a new way
I found a new way
Come on, don't amuse me
I don't need your sympathy
La, la la la la
Ulysses!
I'll find a new way
I'll find a new way, baby

Am I Ulysses, am I Ulysses
No, but you are now, boy?
So sinister
So sinister
But last night was wild

What's the matter there?
Feeling kinda anxious?
That hot blood grow cold?
Yeah, everyone, everybody knows it
Yeah, everyone, everybody know it
Everybody knows I...

La, la la la la
Ulysses!
I'll find a new way
I Ill find a new way, baby

La, la la la la
Ulysses!
I'll find a new way
Well, I'll find a new way, baby

Oh, oh
Then suddenly you know
You're never going home
You're never
You're never
You're never
You're never
You're never
You're never
You're never going home

I'm not Ulysses, baby, no
La la la la, wooh
You're not Ulysses, wooh
La la la la, wooh
