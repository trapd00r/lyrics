When I'm an old lady
I'm gonna be his baby
I'm gonna wrap myself around him
And then I'm gonna kiss him

But that's all way down the line
You see, for now he isn't mine
But I don't mind waiting
And the longing's not aching

'Cause I know
One day he'll say "That's my girl."
The happiest words in the world
Make me laugh like an idiot, not be so serious

For now, when I'm around him
I act like I don't care for him
I even act like I don't like him
Ignore him to spite him

But only so that I won't smile at him
For everyone would know I love him
And that's so uncool
'Cause it's messing with all the rules

And I know
One day he'll say "That's my girl."
The happiest words in the world
Make me laugh like an idiot, not be so serious

One day he'll say "That's my girl."
The happiest words in the world
Make me laugh like an idiot, not be so serious
Make me laugh like an idiot, not be so serious
Make me laugh like an idiot, not be so serious
