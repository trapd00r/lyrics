Hoo!
This is what a woman wants

Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date, that's fine
But he better be on time

Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah, I like it that way

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's lookin' better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He better say, "Mmm, I like it like that, yeah"

And if I changed my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah, I like it that way

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine, hoo!

Let me hear you say yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah, I like it that way

Any man (Any man) (Any man)
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'
Breathtakin' earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine, hoo!

You gotta shimmy, shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, do-si-do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody, on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup, two, hup, woo! Ha ha ha
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
Hoo! Ha ha ha
This is what a woman wants
