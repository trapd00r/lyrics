Fly little sparrow
High above the clouds,
Looking for a place to
Lay your weary body down.

Fly on little sparrow
Northward to the sun,
Wonder if you'll ever
Find yourself a home.

Tell me, Little sparrow
Tell me, What do you see?
I see a concrete canyon
Without a single tree,
And it goes winding on for ever
Where once proud rivers ran,
Oh I hope that I can find
One truly happy man.

Fly little sparrow
High above the clouds,
Looking for a place to
Lay your weary body down.

I seek a land of far horizons
Of gentle winds and summer rain,
Where the children are not hungry
And they've put an end to pain,
And I will sing a song of freedom
In the arms of a golden tree,
Is there such a place on earth
For a tiny bird like me?

Fly little sparrow
High above the clouds,
Looking for a place to
Lay your weary body down.

Yes and fly on little sparrow
Northward to the sun,
Wonder if you'll ever
Find yourself a home.
