Since my baby left me
I've found a new place to dwell
Down the end on Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

And I'm so, I'm so lonely
I'm so lonely
I'm so lonely I could die

And though it's always crowded
You still can't find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom

And be so lonely
Oh so lonely
Oh, so lonely [Incomprehensible]

Well that bellhop's tears keep flowin'
The desk clerk's dressed in black
They've been so long on Lonely Street
They never will go back

And they're so lonely
Oh they're so lonely
They're so lonely they afraid to die

Now if your baby leaves you
Have a little tale to tell
Take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel

Be so lonely
I'll be so lonely
We'll be so lonely that we could die
