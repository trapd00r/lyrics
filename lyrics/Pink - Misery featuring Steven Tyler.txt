Shadows are fallin' all over town
Another night and these blues got me down
Oh misery
I sure could use some company

Since you've been gone, I ain't been the same
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause such misery

Oh, misery
Oh, misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause me misery

And oh, I've been down this road before
Where the passion it turns into pain
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I'd never get caught up again

But ain't it true, it takes what it takes
And sometimes we get too smart too late
One more heartache for me
Another night in misery

Oh, misery
Oh, misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?
Misery
Misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?

Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause misery
Misery
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause me misery
