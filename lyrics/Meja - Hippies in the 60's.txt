I don磘 need therapy 
I don磘 need Disney (to be happy)
I don磘 need you to tell me 
I don磘 need TV (to be happy)

I don磘 need to get laid
I don磘 need an upgrade(to be happy)
I don磘 need looks that won磘 fade
I don磘 need to get paid(to be happy)

Chorus
Hippies in the 60's
wore flowers in their hair
I can still feel the
love vibrations in the air
Hippies in the 60's
knew money isn磘 God
I wish I was there 

I don磘 need celebrity
I don磘 need ecstasy (to be happy)
I don磘 need plastic surgery
I just wanna to be free(to be happy)

Sit on a granite boulder
let the sunshine warm your skin
Turn on,turn on, drop out, drop out
tune in 

Chorus
