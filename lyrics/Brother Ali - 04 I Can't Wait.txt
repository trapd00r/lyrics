Feat. Brother Ali & Shaprece

We've come so far, and now they asking who we are
Cause we reach for the stars
And it's been so long, are you planning on going on
And now they see, exactly what it takes to be
Something different
And when ... we here and we ain't going nowhere

Here's the junior album, the 3rd time's a charm
And they ain't sleeping on me, no, they heard my alarm
Word minus bond, this is what they waiting on
Haters y'all keep hating on, most just love the way I slay a song
And every stage I'm on
I do it with no make up on
Been married to this tier since 04
You can't break our bond, I made it strong
Built to last y'all till the day I'm gone
And if its the dark ages of rap, well here's the break of dawn
Its a new day, like record stores on Tuesday
Mama told me whack shit is the devil, Bobby Bushay
Excuse me, cutting past these rapper talking nonsense
About how they[re] God next, your corny crowns and makin' bomb threats
But you ain't blowing up shit, except your own ego
Until it pops and you drop and your throwin a fit
With your carreer cold in a ditch
No choice but calling it quits
It's over that's it
Don't worry its for your own benefit

We've come so far, and now they asking who we are
Cause we reach for the stars
And it's been so long, are you planning on going on
And now they see, exactly what it takes to be
Something different
And when ... we hit and we ain't going nowhere

I never sacrifice my own self to follow trends
What you see is what you get that's how it always been
For some of y'all attend, you're hot for a year
12 months you got it on now watch it all disappear
Surprise I'm still here
It ain't my fault you not authentic
Fake it till you make it
Get naked without your gimmick
I fuck with Chucks, 501's, and my Russel hoodies
Ask me, its how it should be
... nothing to me
So what y'all gigging bout
Yeah, thats what I can live without
It don't affect the verdict when I propose I'm one of the sickest out
And when my pen is out it's never been a doubt...
No I ain't in a drought
Cats can say they better than
Me all they want but y'all wording ain't worth the reticent
The flow is heaven sent
Been places you'll have never went
That's why you only catch me with the truth
Here's the evidence

We've come so far, and now they asking who we are
Cause we reach for the stars
And it's been so long, are you planning on going on
And now they see, exactly what it takes to be
Something different
And when ... we hit and we ain't going nowhere

I be riding through my own hood
And I'm in the same whip, number 5 city bus
Ain't you famous, used to feel great when they told me that I made it
Then got deflated when they spit and said he ain't shit
Nobody ever taught us how to grow
... the next day you blow
But what's between those parts, nobody know
It ain't but one, way to get something done
... Tv made us so fucking dumb
How we can't seem to manage how to walk and chew out bubble gum
...we leave the message of the cats who gone
To the ones coming next as we pass the...

We've come so far, and now they asking who we are
Cause we reach for the stars
And it's been so long, I ain't planning on going on
And now they see, exactly what it takes to be
Something different
And when ... we hit and we ain't going nowhere
