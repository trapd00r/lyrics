Well, I've got a brand new lover
I love her, yes I do 
She's my one and only 
And her name is Baby Blue


Well now, baby, baby, baby 
Baby, Baby Blue, Yeah
Baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, Baby Blue-ooh

Well now, when I met my baby
I say, How to do you do 
She looked into my eyes and say 
My name is Baby Blue. 

Well now, baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, Baby Blue O-Ohhh
Baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, Baby Blue 
(Now, now, now, now) 
(Solo, background repeats baby, baby....ahhhs) 

Well, I know my baby loves me
I know that she'll be true 
I'm sure of this each time I look 
Into her eyes of blue 

Well now, baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, Baby Blue Yeah
Baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, Baby Blue
