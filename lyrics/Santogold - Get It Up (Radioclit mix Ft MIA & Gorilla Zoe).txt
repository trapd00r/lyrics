Police officer:
May I see your driver's license please?
(frustrated)
May I see your driver's license please?
What's that in your cassette deck?

Gorilla Zoe:
All the hoes jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage, got the whole club rockin'
Maybe you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick she poppin'
We bottle poppin', you cock blockin'
Told ya girl you rap, but ya CD floppin'
You say you gettin' money man, we ain't seen nothin'
Ya girl is persistent, she ain't stoppin'

Man, she say she want a
(Hood nigga)
I keep the perp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town
(Hood nigga)
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
(Hood nigga)
Got my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks
Pancakes? You ain't know
(Hood nigga)
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk
(Hood nigga)

And I don't need a scale for the work
I can eyeball perp, I am not you jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared, go to church
Man, this rap shit is easy
Every beat I get, I murk

(Hood nigga)
I keep the perp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town
(Hood nigga)
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
(Hood nigga)
Got my Chevy sittin' on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks
Pancakes? You ain't know

I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk

Santogold:
Day and night
Realize I won't be easy
Got no light
A job, a wife that's easy
Always standing in the door
Always the same reason you're stuck
No guts, no guts

What will you get it up for?
What will you get it up for?
Harder, you're still stuck in the mire

What will make you want it more?
What will make you want it more?
Harder, get more bang for your dollar

M.I.A.:
Get it up, you can get it up
Get it up, you can get it up
Get it up, you can get it up
Get it up, you can get it up

Get it up, you can get it up
Get it up, you can get it up
Get it up, you can get it up
Get it up, you can get it up

Sometimes I think I harden
When I feel I get fucked up
Yeah, other times I think I harden
When I feel I get spat out

Yeah, I don't really know what you're thinking
But I already know what you are
And this is what makes us harden
In this concrete life we got

I break 'em in like shoes and my new jeans
I throw it in like a spanner in your work pen
I watch you want more, curious to dirty things
And make it swing from being slick to new things

I break 'em in like shoes and my new jeans
I throw it in like a spanner in your work pen
I watch you want more, curious to dirty things
And make it swing from being slick to new things

Get it up
