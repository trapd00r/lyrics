Ahh
I rap poisonous, I sent him his liver (Here you go)
Fill you up with rat poisonous, I'm venomous when I
Run up in 'em, put the gun up in 'em, deliver his dinner
It was liver and intestines, I'm doo-dooin' on your vest, yeah
Sittin' on the records and shittin' on niggas records
When I spit, my veins pop out, it's like my neck hurt (What you doin'?)
I'm playin' Monopoly, you niggas playin' checkers
Better start rappin' better before I put one in your sweater
You don't wanna get the chokehold
You sound like you been swallowin' cum, listen at your vocals
I'm sellin' hella records, nigga, you doin' all them broke shows
So nobody came, you couldn't even hire the po-po
You local, nigga, I get all around the US
I spit that shit that'll make you have to wear two vests, I'm a cool mess
Grr, my verses give you throat cancer 'cause of what I wrote and some
I'm Charlie Manson
Grr
