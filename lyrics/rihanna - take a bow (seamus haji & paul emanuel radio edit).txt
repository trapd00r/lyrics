Oh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah, standin' ovation
Oooh, oh yeah, yeah y-yeah yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (ooh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (ooh)
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show (ooh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
Oh oh oh

Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
Ya better hurry up before the sprinklers come on (Come on)
Talkin' 'bout, "Girl I love you, you're the one."
This just looks like a rerun
Please, what else is on?

And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not (mhmm)
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (ooh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Ohh, and the award for the best liar goes to you
For making me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech out

How 'bout a round of applause?
A standin' ovation

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtains finally closing

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

But it's over now...
