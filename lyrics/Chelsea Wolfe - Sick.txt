This suffering brings me closer to you
And time is broken and moves slow
Your pure heart, your white light
I should be put to death for ever being cruel to you
You washed me clean like no one ever could
Come closer now and step right into
The wide mouth, the sharp teeth of the one you love
I'm not the kind of sick that you can fix
Don't you worry about me baby
I've got no enemies and I've got no time
The song, we carry on
Even though you pushed us down
We carry on
When you try to blind my eyes I can see tenfold
It's nothing that my heart can't take, 'cause your hate has made me strong
And stronger men than you have tried to break me
Stronger men than you have tried to break me
Leaning toward the golden days
Forget about the older days
And everything we left behind
To stand here in another life
We carry on, even though you held us down
We carry on, with the song
We carry on, even though you pushed us down
We carry on
