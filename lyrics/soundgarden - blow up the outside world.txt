Nothing, seems to kill me
No matter how hard I try
Nothing's closing my eyes
Nothing can beat me down 
For your pain or delight, no

And nothing, seems to break me
No matter how far I fall
Nothing can break me at all
Not one for giving up
Though not invincible, I know

I've given everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone

I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and

Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world

Someone, tried to tell me something
Don't let the world, bring you down
Nothing can do me in, before I do myself
So save it for your own, and the ones you can help, no

I've given everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone

I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and

Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside world

Want to make it understood
Wanting though I never would
Trying though I know it's wrong
Blowing it to hell and gone
Wishing though I never could

Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside 
Blow up the outside world

(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside) Blow up the outside
(Blow up the outside) Blow up the outside world
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
(Blow up the outside)
