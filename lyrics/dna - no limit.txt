No Limit lyrics

No limits
No limits
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
Realise
No limits
We got all we need
We got love.

Everyone around us say
That love could never be the way
No way
They try to put up a wall between us
But we just went straight ahead
Now they look at us and say
We live our lives without a care
Uh-huh
But they forget how they try to break up
All the love we have to share

Time has moved along
Still the love we have is growing stronger
Maybe now they'll try to understand
The key to life that we have found..

[Chorus]
No limits
To what we can achieve
'cause were in love
Deeply love
No limits
'cause we know the truth
That love will come to us
Some people
Are far too blind to see
That you and I
Realise
No limits
To what we can achieve
'cause we got all we need
We got love.

We may have our ups and downs
But our love allway makes the day
Uh-huh
We never let things come between us
We get by in every way
Yeah'

Time have moved along
Still the love we have is growing stronger
Maybe now they'll try to understand
The key to life that we have found

[Chorus]
No limits
To what we can achieve
'cause were in love
Deeply love
No limits
'cause we know the truth
That love will come to us
Some people
Are far too blind to see
That you and I
Realise
There's no limits
To what we can achieve
'cause we got all we need
We got love.

[Guitar - Bass jam!]

Time! Time!
Time have moved along
Still the love we have is growing stronger
Maybe now they'll try to understand
The key to life that we have found

[Chorus]
No limits
To what we can achieve
'cause were in love
Deeply love
No limits
'cause we know the truth
That love will come to us
Some people
Are far too blind to see
That you and I
Realise
No limits
To what we can achieve
'cause we got all we need
We got love.

We've found love
