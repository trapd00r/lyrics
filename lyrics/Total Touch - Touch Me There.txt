Free me from rules, for only one night 
Desirable as you are, tryin' to keep myself in line 
Although your movements feels so right 
Keep my glory high 

Touch me here, baby 
Won't you kiss me there 
Let's dance away forever 
I like the way you groovin' 
like you just don't care 
Tonight we'll fly to heaven 

Caress my body and my soul 
I need to take care of, i 'm just a little girl 
not asking for a razorfaced lover 
Don't make me scared, don't push me in to your arms 

I'll find me softly your affection 
Bring it to me 

You're such an oversacrificed boy 
I never thought that it would matter to me 
And even when I try to keep my distance 
I see your eyes lithnin', my face starts to glow 

Your power makes me feel so shy 
Keep my glory high 

I'll find me softly your affection 
You gotta bring it to me 
Your power makes me feel so shy, shy, shy, wow 
Keep my glory high, keep my glory high
