Go!

You say that I can trust you
I don't know
Everytime I'm near you
I lose control
I must be out of my mind
To let you in
Maybe I should try to find
My strength within

It's only a matter of time and I will surrender
Just give me a little more time to open my mind
It's only a matter of time and I will surrender
Surrender to you

Fears I leave them far behind
To resist you I don't know how
Love sometimes can be unkind
Should I lay my heart on the line now
When temptation comes along
I can't hide it I can't fight it
Feelings inside are getting strong
To not deny it
You've got it

Surrender (whisper) repeat

It's only a matter of time and I will surrender
Just give me a little more time to open my mind
It's only a matter of time and I will surrender
Surrender to you
