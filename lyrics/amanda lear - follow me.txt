I'm getting out
I'm moving on
And from now on
address unknown
I shall be difficult to find
So follow me
just follow me.

I'll sell you dreams and new desires
I'm trading hopes
I'm open late
I am the night
I am your fate
So follow me
just follow me.

Faust was right
have no regret
Gimme your soul
I'll give you life
And all the things you want to get
So follow me
just follow me.
I'll give you wings
I'll sell you fame
Merry-go-round
maybe to hell
I am the key to your problem
So follow me
just follow me.
Unbelievable maybe
You'll have a new identity
For a second of vanity
I want to change your destiny . . .
Unbelievable maybe
. . .
Follow me
follow me
I'll give you anything you want
Your wish is my command
If you agree to follow me.
