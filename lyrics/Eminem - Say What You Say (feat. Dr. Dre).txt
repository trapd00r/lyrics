Dr. Dre 
So I'm out the game huh?

Eminem 
Yo Dre, we riding?

Dr. Dre
Whatever

Eminem
Well I'm with ya, homie

Dr. Dre
OK
Let's handle the small shit

Eminem
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much
Knew too much shit, corrupt
And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick n'rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

Dr. Dre
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age

Eminem
But what about Jermaine?

Dr. Dre
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what you're saying
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me, with a bunch of little mini-yous
Running round your backyard swimming pools
Over eighty million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds

Eminem
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup
If you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
We'll have you blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play Devil's advocate 

Dr. Dre
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on
I would

Eminem
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could

Dr. Dre
From the 'hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered

Eminem
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
'Cause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck; white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up
And sell a mil' or grow up to be Atilla
Go nuts and be a killer

Dr. Dre
And I'm something of a phenom'
One puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us

Eminem
C'mon!

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Dr. Dre
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Aliz√©, partying all day
But I handle my business 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sending it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space; you invade it?
Live to regret it then you die trying to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated

Eminem
Like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood, if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone
And now I'm back
I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad 

Dr. Dre
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, and invest in something
To protect your head and neck

Eminem
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in ""The Source""?
Ain't holding my fucking breath
But I suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breath to collect a fucking check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Dr. Dre
Watch your fuckin' mouth

Timbaland
Yo this Timbaland
Tell him I said suck my dick
