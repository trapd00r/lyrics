Dr. Dre 
oh, so I'm out the game huh?

Eminem 
Yo Dre, we ridin?

Dr. Dre
Whatever

Eminem
Well I'm witya, homie

Dr. Dre
Okay, well let's handle the small shit

Eminem
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick went through too much knew to much shit
Corrupt and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick n rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him? Wouldn't be shit 

Dr. Dre
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age 

Eminem
But what about Jermaine? 

Dr. Dre
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think 
I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me, with a buncha little mini-you's
Runnin round your backyard swimmin pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds 

Eminem
Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh? 

Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh? 

Second verse, it gets worst
It gets no better than this
Amatuers drink veteran piss
From a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you
Black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't havin it as long as Im here, play devil's advocate 

Dr. Dre
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the indusrty that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on
I would 

Eminem
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could 

Dr. Dre
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered 

Eminem
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warnin
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
Cuz I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white-pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up
And sell a mill or grow up to be Atilla
Go nuts and be a killer 

Dr. Dre
And I'm somethin of a phenom
One puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us C'mon 

Eminem
Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh? 

Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh? 

Dr. Dre
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin all day
But I handle my business cuz it' work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you could have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin it your way
That goes for anyone who walks thru that doorway
Cuz this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it and you die tryin to violate it
Fuck around and you'll get annihilated
Eyes dilated... 

Eminem
...like my old lady
Cuz what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things
Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed write and my loose-leaf's my lanch pad 

Dr. Dre
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, then invest in something
To protect your head and neck 

Eminem
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in the Source
Ain't holdin' my fuckin breath
But I suffocate for the respect
Fore I breath to collect a fuckin check 

Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh? 

Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it

So who you playin with huh huh huh huh? 

Dr. Dre
Watch your fuckin' mouth 

Timbaland
Yo this Timbaland, tell him I said suck (ti-tick) my dick
