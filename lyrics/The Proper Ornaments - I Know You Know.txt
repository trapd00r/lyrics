[Verse 1]
When you make up your mind tomorrow
It might be late, I might be gone
I know you know things could've been different
But they're not

[Verse 2]
I know I wasn't a good friend
But if I was, it might've been the same
I know you know things could've been different
But they're not

[Outro]
I know you know things could've been different
But they're not
