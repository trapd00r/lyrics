Life is a paradise
Oho, yeaheah

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

I believe life could be paradise once again
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
Close your eyes, it's something for you

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
I'm a prisoner of hope, I know

We are young and we are old
We're fallin' like leaves
And your heart's so full of soul
It makes me believe
Once again, it's something for you

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know

A bridge over time
Was what you need to see the light
To see the light
Oh, yeah!

Lucky love, lucky love
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
Lucky love, lucky love
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven, oho, yeaheah

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
I'm a prisoner of hope, I know
