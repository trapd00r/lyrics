There's a time for living.
But time keeps on flying.
You get some loving
And the whole love cries
Can you really feel?
(Happy?)
Are your feelings real? or is it just a game?
What a mad delusion
Living in this confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can we ever live without the game?
The sad game?
You can love; it's not love
It can't be true
You can tell those lies to people
But you're only fooling you
Can you really feel?
Are your feelings real?
Oh what a game
Oh what a game
Oh what a game
You can feel
And your feelings aren't real

Then you'd better stop trying
Or your gonna be crying!
That's the game!
