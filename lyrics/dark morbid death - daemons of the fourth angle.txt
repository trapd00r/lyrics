[I:]
Slaves of Jesus lick the Holy Mother Mary's cunt
Lambs befallen by worms are sodomized by leprous saints
Eyes of God are burning, fall into the evil land
Drink the wine of Satan, hear the gospel of the damned!
Commander of dark gods in ritual sleep
Come forth through the void of eternity
Transform spectral lives through the vast fields obscure
Grant magical skills to drink angel blood pure
Mortal sin, apocalyptic minds
Revelation of death to the world of the blind
Disharmonic unity, enemies of the creation
Rising titans, force of desecration
Valley of Hell, atrophic land
Cardinal power of archangels damned
Horrific sight, morbid priests of the earth
Sitting upon the four corners of the world
Basilisk force
Dancing eye of mass extermination
Aeon of tyranny, cosmic hell, sea of renewal
Rape us sweet, Zion tremble, we are invincible
Our armies ride against New Jerusalem
Our magic ruins the world
Satan cometh with signs and wonders
Holy golden doors are shut forever, them to suffocate within
A sea of black tears from the mouth of a whore
Siblings fighting each other with poisoned swords
Vision from the waste sepulchral lands
Final plea of sinners in agony and death
Commander of dark gods in ritual sleep
Come forth through the void of eternity
Transform spectral lives through the vast fields obscure
Grant magical skills to drink angel blood pure
A spring never again to cease, erupting malicious disease
Black crystal fluid of the wicked strong, racing dance of demons
Beheld in sight of the cyclopic grinning moon
In the temple of mystical suffering
A six legged beast with the ten horns of damnation
And seven emerald crowns hath given birth to our new messiah
Kaos vortex throne of night, eating crippled beasts of god
A throne of steel and horrors, surrounded by black sepulchral frostwinds
Pestilence blessing
Dragon claw hammers, dragon spitting sulphur
Ecliptic spheres, sunrise vortex
The galley arks are sent for us, and the powers
Gei-Hinnam eternal - thunder, lightning, doom and kaos
Cloudfallen majesty, Dark Lord now come!
Bestow animation upon the unliving yet restless and eagerly awaiting
Inexorable fate, destruction of the grave
The sleeper will wake and the world will bleed
Infernal race - unholy blaze - sleeper awake - DEATH IS LIFE

[II:]
Parched with thirst my lips my throat, I am condemned
I gnash my teeth, let me confess unspeakable deeds
As the lake waters close above me, consolation in deathlike rapture
I might find - rewarded by the guilt-less joy instead of horrors
Avenge my blood in ecstasy and oblivion, and ravings of insanity
Another race of beings rise, by the terrible vengeance of my hands
Aided by a glimmering light which turneth into a tempestuous shine

[III:]
Calls from the past to rise and rule - works of Ungodliness
Conjuration of the flesh, Lord Majesty appear unto us
And get the seven holy virgins, in a state of superhuman trance...
Gaia dissolve in dark matter, Tetragrammaton hosts killed by
Fire and fear, landscapes bursting under the feet of the angels
Elder Lords Invincible Ones - the claws of evil, doom...
The love of god is banished by a curse of the wicked ones
And Hell is the centre of the universe
Terror of a dying world, infernal black devastation
Blood red slaughter hell, TRANSFORMUTATION!
