In your eyes I see a long road
From a far lost paradise
Is it where all of your thoughts go
When they run away from me in the night

In your voice there is a trembling
And I hear when you're saying my name
You don't know when you're pretending
Guess you've gotten too good at the game

If you believe your only defense is perpetual motion
How can you come home
If you don't love me enough to let go of your running
Babe I'll let you go

It's a useless conversation
Cause your heart's gone out the door
And the freedom that you're chasing
Is the only thing that you're fighting for

You never did dare to surrender
Maybe you had too much to lose
And you're talking to me like its forever
And I'm wondering what you're trying to prove

If you believe your only defense is perpetual motion
How can you come home
If you don't love me enough to let go of your running
Babe I'll let you go

If you believe your only defense is perpetual motion
How can you come home
If you don't love me enough to let go of your running
Babe I'll let you go

Babe I'll let you go
