Slowly the pen touches paper in the guidance of the words that you write.
Memories roll in; of the things you once did
and who you had shared them with is somebody thinking of you.
Did I bother telling you this, with the words that cross teeth and jump lips?
A poor choice of words, in wanting to tell you anything.
But words don't come with ease. They're forever my hurt.
Would it really matter, if you were to count the days left with your hands?
Your focus secure and the loves you left; well
smiles staged in photographs here until...

You, you left the light on.
There's a chance I might have tripped, girl
You were there to hold on.

[Chorus:]
Ignoring the words of your obnoxious little brother;
kill or be killed spilled the words from your mother.
I'll lay awake for a while.
I'll leave the light on a while.
But you couldn't last a lifetime. Caught between here and the days of it;
carving her name across your arm with every wish. It's hit or miss... her.
I told you so. I measured distance in lines departing the rest of my life.

But you, you, you... you had better things to do [x2]
Liar, liar, liar, liar. [x6]

[Chorus]

If you get put to sleep, like an old dog, you're better off.
If you get put to sleep;
I've been cautious with the words I extend.
Allow this year before the world starts to end.

Your father's dead. He passed in his sleep,
and I woke to the sounds of her crying.
[x3]

Your father's dead. He passed in his sleep.

Pray for us all. [to fade]
