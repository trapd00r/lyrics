My gun is pumping - get down on your knees
A closer step to death
I think I'm coming, get ready to receive
I spray you full with my killer disease

I'll come inside, I'll break you down
Your end of your line
I steal your soul, I'm in control
I just made you mine

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces
Crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
How could this be

Face the enemy and meet reality
How could you be so blind
Now you're tasting death it controls your mind
Suffering years ahead

I came inside
I broke you down
I ended your life
I stole your soul
I was in control
And I made you mine

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces
Crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
Is not the way it supposed to be

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces
Crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
How could this be

How could you be so blind

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces
Crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
Is not the way it supposed to be

It's the end of the line
You're broken to pieces
Crushed by the facts
It's the end of the line
How could this be
