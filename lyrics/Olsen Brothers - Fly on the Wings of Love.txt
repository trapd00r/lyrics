In the summer night
When the moon shines bright
Feeling love forever
And the heat is on
When the daylight is gone
Still - happy together
There is just one more thing I would like to add
She is the greatest love I've ever had
Fly on the wings of love
Fly baby fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky
And as time goes by
There is a lot to try
And I'm feeling lucky
In the softest sand
Smiling hand in hand
Love is all around me
There's just one more thing I would like to add
She is the greatest love I've ever had
Fly on the wings of love
Fly baby fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky
