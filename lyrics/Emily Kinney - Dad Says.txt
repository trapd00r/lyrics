I am giving up one of my dreams today
 I found out I can't always get my way
 And sometimes a dream isn't worth what you pay
 So I'm giving up one of my dreams today
 When we are children we look to the sky
 We want everything, I'm afraid to ask why

And I saw the sparkling fish in the sea
 I dreamed I would find one who'd swim next to me
 And this called love and it's worth every reason
 Love is the cool and the warmth in each season
 But how does one love and what does one do
 When the the dream that you have doesn't want to pick you
 But oh oh don't cry for me

It's just one dream less on my shoulder
 And oh oh dad says giving up dreams is just a sign I'm getting older
 He was a stoner and I'm like a light
 And when he would blaze id sing songs by his side
 But my dream takes two strong hearts that will fight
 And he doesn't dream, he just sleeps at night
 And oh oh don't cry for me

It's just one dream less on my shoulder
 And oh oh dad says giving up dreams, is just a sign I'm getting older
 Oh they say to much smoking will change your taste
 Maybe that's why he's kissing some other girls face
 But I never dreamed of second place
 So id rather just quit than continue to race
 And oh oh don't cry for me

It's just one dream less on my shoulder
 And oh oh dad says giving up dreams is just a sign I'm getting older
 And oh oh oh I am singing on stage
 But it doesn't mean I know much better

Oh oh oh oh
 Your probably like me

Some days dreaming and some days a quitter
 I am giving up one of my dreams today
 After I held him and begged him to stay
 And after my dream will drown out to a whisper
 After I've burnt all the photo booth pictures

And after I erased our names from the sky
 Stopped wondering how and asking why
 Oh I wish I had words to encourage inspire
 But the truth is I'm ripped and I'm sad and I'm tired
 I'm a loser in love and an abandoner of dreams
 And today I have up the one for him, and me
