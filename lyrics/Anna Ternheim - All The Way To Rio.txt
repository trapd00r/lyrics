We ran far away from the house we built
From one wild world into another
We ran from our lovers
Who we said had betrayed us
From one man's arms into another

All the way to Rio
All the way to Rio
To start all over
To start all over

We ran from our friends
Saying they're all the same
Sleepy days and live long
We're the future in a deck of cards
Tore the letters, phones turned off
Said we're better on our own

Down in Rio
Down in Rio
Down in Rio
Down in Rio
To start all over
To start all over
