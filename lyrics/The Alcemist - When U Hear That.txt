take a look back, yeah
take a look, just look back
it's too late, you never know

never go back, but i think back
hear a song on the radio from the past, and get a flashback
cinematic when it plays back, write a story on my life, itll be the soundtrack
11:46 ? central, on a school nite i used to sneak out the window
i was little, my brother neil was in the middle
on the bottom bunk, where i wrote my riddles
get a chill everytime i get a visual
used to think i was invincible
everyday shoplifting competition at the mall was the ritual
i never won, i never made a good criminal
got a problem at the school with the principal
and back then all the music was original
i was young in dumb the future was invisible

take a look back, take a look back

never go back but i reminesce about those past
thinking its a trip how fast we live
flashin back to the sandbox
with my clothes dirty and my jeans were ripped
swinging on the monkey bars tryin to keep my grip
jump on the trampoline till my knees give in
always physical i was a little crazy kid
then i got into the music and i found my niche
found a gift, could of found a ditch
even when bullets came in my direction somehow they missed
try to grab me and stab me somehow they slipped
like a force field, stay the course shed the lords will
even when its over ima go to war still
even when im gone ima be making noise still
i could never live forever but the voice will
always knew i would be somebody that the world feel

8x take a look back, at your life now

i admit sometimes i speed for no reason
sometimes i roll up the weed for no reason
take a breath of fresh air for no reason
cause you never know when your gonna be leaving
so i get up with the old clique
and reminesce while we thumbin through a box full of old flicks
laughin at the funny clothes and outfits

take a look back, take a look back

yeah they say time keep on slippin
but im sunk in the coupe i just keep on dippin
switchin up the gears i keep on shifting
daydreams my mind it keeps on drifting
like jdilla ima keep living
never feel like a beats finished
ima perfectionist
never really happy with it so i messed with
its a god given talent i was blessed with it
thinkin back from past occurences
its endless i could only scratch the surface
but its a new day so ill let the sunshine 
thru the window when i crack the curtain
only death is certain, only tax is certain
take a break for a minute then its back to workin

8x take a look back, at your life now
