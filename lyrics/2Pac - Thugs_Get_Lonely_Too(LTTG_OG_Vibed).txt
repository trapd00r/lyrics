(Verse 1: 2Pac)
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around
And it's always drama
Whevever I wanna get around
Mama told me
Long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to watchya' do
And keep ya' game up
'Cause things change
And jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to mack her!
I'm on tour
But still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry
I'm steady wantin' more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard
But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home
All alone
Ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone
In my mind
I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew.

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Still I be gettin' lonely for you I'm comin' home as soon as I make this pay. (echoes)

(Verse 2: 2Pac)
I call you up long distance
On the telephone
I wanna tuck you in
Even though I know I can't make it home
I whisper things in your' ear
Like your near me
Wonder if you feel me
From far away
Or can you hear me
It seems to me
That your' jealous
'Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money
With the fellas'
In the back streets
Tryin' to trap me
Baby hold up
Thugs get lonely too!
But I'm a soulja
And theres no way I'm a' stop makin' money
'Cause your' attitudes changed
And your' actin' a little funny
Always complainin'
Sayin' we don't spend time
Can't you see
I got enough stress on my mind
And hangin' up like you all that
And get mad when I'm tell you that
"I'm busy baby call back"
Please, ain't nothin' left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too
You know.

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Still I be gettin' lonely for you I'm comin' home as soon as I make this pay. (echoes)

(Verse 3: 2Pac)
I sit alone in my room, drinkin'
Without a care
Talkin out loud to you'
Like your' there
Take your' picture out my back pocket
Man it's on
You the first face I wanna see
When I get home
I wanna love you 'till the sun rise
Buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house
Thug style
Put your' hands on the headboard
Think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you
Sick of scenes in yo' head
That I'm makin' love
So turn the lights down
Reminice 'n relax
'Cause baby right now
I feel in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear
Baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly
Watch the ceiling
Scratch my back
How you react
Lets me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm givin' to you
Is so true
Thugs get lonely too
You know.

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Still I be gettin' lonely for you I'm comin' home as soon as I make this pay. (echoes)

(Outro: Tupac Talking)
Yeah! Thug Life Baby
