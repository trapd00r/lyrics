Precious are the moments in your presence 
I can almost taste it 
Like my whole life’s been wasted 
Without you I was empty, I was jaded 
I was broken and indifferent 

Oh, if I could be anything, anything I want 
If I could anything at all 

I would be everything you need 
I would be everything you touch 
I’d be the answer to your dreams 
`Cause I want so much to mean that much to you, baby 

Your eyes, full of promise, 
Full of passion for each moment 
And compassion for the fallen 
Lift me ever higher and insire me 
To be all that you know I can be 

Oh, if I could be anything, anything I want 
If I could anything at all 

I would be everything you need 
I would be everything you touch 
I’d be the answer to your dreams 
`Cause I want so much to mean that much to you, baby 

Everything you touch 
Everything you see 
Everything you want 
Anything at all 

I would be everything you need 
I would be everything you touch 
I’d be the answer to your dreams 
`Cause I want so much to mean that much to you, baby 

I would be everything you touch 
I would be everything you want 
I’d be the silence when you sleep 
Just to wake you with my love
