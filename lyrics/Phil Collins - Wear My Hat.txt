Well she came looking for me with her arms open wide
Like some long-lost friend of mine
She said "excuse me, but do you remember me?"
I said "No I, don't believe I do"
So she looked me up and down and undressed me with her eyes
And she said "you've got everything I need, you've got everything I want"
So I said Ok

You can wear my hat, you can have my coat
You can take my shirt, 'cause I need don't need it
You can wear my shoes, you can take my socks
Come on take my bag it's yours
If you love it, you can have it if you love it
I got no problem if you love it
Come on take it if you love it

So her friend came up to me with a pen and paper in her hand
Expressing some interest in the number of my room
She "Excuse me, but do you remember me?"
I said "no" she said "can I appeal to you?"
So I looked her up and down and realising her insinuations I blushed
She said "listen babe, you don't know me"
No you don't know but you owe me
And I love you, yes I love you
Put your arms around me 'cause I love you
And I got all your records, and I love you

So I suggested
You can wear my hat, you can have my coat
You can take my shirt, 'cause I need don't need it
You can wear my shoes, you can take my socks
Come on take my bag it's yours
If you love it, you can have it if you love it
I got no problem if you love it
Come on take it if you love it
Love, come on love it

Well later that day this guy came to me with a scrap of paper in his hand
He said "Hey buddy! Can you sign you name for me"
I said "No, why do I owe you money?"
He said "No"
I said "Listen pal do I know you, have we ever met?"
Why do you want my name on this little piece of paper?
He said "I love you"
I don't know you, but I love you
Like my brother, I love you
Put your arms around me 'cause I love you
I said "hey let's not rush things"

You can wear my hat, you can have my coat
You can take my shirt, 'cause I need don't need it
You can wear my shoes, you can take my socks
Come on take my bag it's yours
If you love it, you can have it if you love it
I got no problem if you love it
Come on take it if you love it

Ain't no problem for me if you want it
Take my hat take my bags, I don't need nothing
You can wear my hat, you can wear my hat
Come on wear my hat, you can wear my hat
You can wear my hat, come one wear my hat
You can wear my hat, come on wear my hat
