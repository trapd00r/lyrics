[Verse 1: The Game]
Let me tell you a story about this bitch I know
Grew up on the south side sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went hollywood, one trip to the west coast
She got fucked by this white bitch, had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat I didnt give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young bitch keep my nuts drained
But all the time she was plotting on my Aftermath chain
Bitch couldnt stay in here lane
Started running with this hoe from the south
Gold grill in her mouth, she put her on the track
Gave her, her first thong, introduced her to her two girlfreinds from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route,
Ran into a gangster and he turned they ass out,

Chorse:
You will always be my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
And im will always love my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
I will always fuck my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
She will always be my bitch- my bitch- my bitch

[Verse 2: The Game]
From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get, so they thought she was gay
Booshie bitch who ever thought she was raised in B.K.
Moved out the hood, changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in '96
She had a wavey haircut and some big ass lips
At first she was hard to hit, come to find out the last 10 years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now, a house made of bricks
Four grown ass kids and aint none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna Dash when other Dame's around
She tryna play The Game, but I got the bitch number
She said she won't, but she'll be back next summer

Chorse:
You will always be my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
And im will always love my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
I will always fuck my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
She will always be my bitch- my bitch- my bitch

[Verse 3: The Game]
Last but not least my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop, stole Chronic from Doc
Blew the whole west coast, even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the street's she got a few real n1ggas killed
I look up now she on my dick, telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one n1gga got stick with her
I was smart knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around, scandolous shit - somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burnt the bridges and aint had one freind left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress

Chorse:
You will always be my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
And im will always love my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
I will always fuck my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
She will always be my bitch- my bitch- my bitch
