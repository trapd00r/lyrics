Said the voice from afar,
Don't you know it doesn't
have to be so hard? Waiting for
everyone else around to argee,
might take too long

When it won't be so hard,
(it won't be so hard)

Well it's true,yes, but you
wont't get far telling me
that you are all you're meant
to be, when the one from my
dream is sitting right next
to me and I don't know
what to do

Oh alter ego.

Get them to love you,
while the may depending
on your words and wealth,
the only one who's really
judging you is yourself.
Nobodyy else.

If I could part,
it wouldn't be so hard.

Well it's true yes, but you
won't get far telling me that
you are all you're meant to
be when the one from my
dream is sitting right next
to me and I don't know
what to do.

Oh alter ego.
