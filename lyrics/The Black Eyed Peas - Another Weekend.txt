Weekend come for the weekend come
Weekend come for the weekend come
Weekend come for the weekend come
We can't wait for the weekend come
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!

Will.i.am
I call Tab on Wednesday night
So we can make plans for Thursday night
He said, "We could go hit the Pea-bus."
I was like "Yeah, that's my favorite spot."
Plus, I like it there 'cause I got love on the list
High powered juice where I don't need to get frisked
Walk up in the place and get hugs from the misses
Pounds from my brothers 'cause they know we're not disses
The place to be to let it all out
For when the weekend come
The weekend come
Y'all could come
So go tell ya momma come and ya poppa come
Load and spin the record so we can get done
Place packed, capacity maximum
Due to my man Polo promotion
And I can't wait to go out and hit some (hit some)

Esthero
Jumpin' music, swift DJ
Smoke machines and laser beams
Look out weekend, 'cause here I come
Because weekends are... uhr-ur-urrrr...

Apl.de.ap
Walked in the club at like ten o'clock
And the spot is hot, blowing up rooftop (Roof!)
'Cause it's Thursday night and the night is young
Four-day weekend, time to have some fun (Oh!)
DJ stutter up, drop them joints
Everybody's been waitin' to dance and make noise
B-Boyz! Lemme see ya break it down and...
Ladies! Let your hips move around
At the sound of the B.E.P. family
Got poet named Life and the sister (Fergie)
And the blood of Abraham
So let's get ready for the jam

Taboo
It was a Thursday night
And the party was bumpin'
And the bass was thumpin'
And people was jumpin'
And Taboo's at the front
You're comin'
And Taboo's at the front
You're comin'
And...
And...
(Here we come now...)
And...
Na-na-nah!

Will.i.am
Mr. will.i.am, Mr. will.i.am
When, oh when, Mr. will.i.am
Get a boogie on when the weekend come
Check the Pea clock, 'cause the vibe's is strong,
Selena's Phillipinas they come one by one,
All lined up and they ready for fun
Short ones, tall ones, beautiful ones
B-Boyz, B-Girlz ready to "What!?"
Breakin' and shakin', movin', doin' the -ish
J rock from the beat junkie's ready to mix
'Cause he cuttin' up the racks for e-very-body
Come on over 'cause we having a party
We lightin' up the sky with a burning star
Throw your hands in the air if you know who you are
'Cause we jumpin' all around with the broshy (?) geezer
Get blessed by the beat from a seat
'Cause they hittin' you with...
