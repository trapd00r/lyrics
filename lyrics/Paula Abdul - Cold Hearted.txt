He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohhh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
Oh oh 
Girl don't play the fool... no

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
And runnin' with the crowd

You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you
When he's out

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohhh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool... no

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check that you
Were waiting by the phone

All the world's a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love girl with him
There's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool... no

How come how come he can he can tell-a tell-a you're-a you're-a
Always always number number one without a doubt
(He's he's one one cold cold snake snake)
When-a when-a he is he is always always squirmin' squirmin'
Like a little snake under-a e-ver-y-a rock?
(No no give give, all all take take)

You've been you've been workin' workin' on the on the love
And he's been only only playing undercover all the while
(One one smooth smooth sharp sharp tongue tongue)
Take a take another 'nother look into his eyes
(He he just just talks)
And you will on-ly see a rep-tile

You could find somebody better girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better girl
He's c-cold as ice
(Cold as ice, he's cold as ice)

Stay away from him, girl!
