Got my top down on my Bentley, I keep it pimpin' the mo
2-85 I be hittin, even when there's nowhere to go
My wrists that hang out the window, my Rollie shinning and shimmer
You see that bad bitch who with ya? If I want I can get er
Make her a active disciple, or envy and make the point
Make my suite presidential and then I fill it with strippers
Man I got chrome on my wheels, and your ho on my dick
Ride around, no roof on my whip, that's how you know I'm the shit
They know I'm rich, it don't matter
Bruh cause as fresh as I be
What she do for you you pay er
What she do me, for free
'Cause I'm a G, still kick it with the trap nigga buyin things

Aye clique, my old school is official, got them horses under my hood
Yeah I'm ridin' round in your side of town, and I'm blowin' O's of that good rip
In the summer time I got to be
In the fly around, who higher than me?
Nigga can't cheat or try to follow me
I bet Pimp C proud of me
I got the city lights in my rearview
We loud and can't hear you
Got a billion on my music, could be closer then in the future

Blowing big stacks, all we do is that
Valet my shit is feel, fuck up a chick a set
Then it's back to the job, hit the gat, burn a gat
Got my double cup dido'd up, paint a lean sealed up
Bruh looking for me bruh, they what never I've seen

Charm a bitch, you see 8 R's nigga
Got purple stuff in my 20 ounce

Pull string, no guitar, put down, roll it down what they hit for

She on my dick, you better come get her
Don't want me on yo street with this clean pain and these white seats
She's gonna be inside here and you have no idea
