Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Gotta get a little 
Gotta get a little 

All the world has gone to bed 
And I am drowning in it's silence 
But a solitude is in my head, from you, maybe 

And if the silence was a song 
Well, its rhythm grooves and it's a private radio 
And on this night I did belong 
In harmony 

And you can't deny me 
And you will oblige me 
It's my melody 

When the night comes 
When no one knows 
I can feel it 
I've got my private radio 

I'm finally out of my pillow 
'Cause I'm lyin' here, but I am ready good to go 
If I don't win I'll leave this town 
Or not, I'll stay and chase the sun now 

And you can't deny me 
And you will oblige me 
It's my melody 

When the night comes 
And no one knows 
I can feel it 
I've got my private radio 

Catch me, not care 
Call me later 
Morning's risin' 

All the world has gone to bed 
And there's a sound inside my head 
And in the dark inside my bed 
And the melody inside my head 

(When the night comes) 
There's a part of me no one will never know 
(And no one knows) 
And midnight comes and I know I'm on my own 
(I can feel it) 
There's a part of me no one will ever see 
(I've got my private radio) 
There's a part of me no one will ever leave be 
(My private radio) 
My private radio 
My private radio
