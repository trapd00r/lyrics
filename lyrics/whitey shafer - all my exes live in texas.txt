All my ex's live in Texas,
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be.
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee.

Rosanna's down in Texarkana; wanted me to push her broom,
And sweet Eileen's in Abilene; she forgot I hung the moon,
And Allison from Galveston somehow lost her sanity,
And Dimples who now lives in Temple's got the law lookin' for me.

All my ex's live in Texas,
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be.
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee.

I remember that old Brazos river where I learned to swim.
But it brings to mind another time when I wore my welcome thin.
By transcendental meditation, I go there each night,
But I always come back to myself long before daylight.

Cause All my ex's live in Texas,
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be.
But all my ex's live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee.

Some folks think I'm hidin',
It's been rumored that I died,
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee.
