I am, I am the American Eagle, eyes of a sparrow,
Right hand branch, left hand arrow
Chasing a dollar, in an Impala
White trash heart-throb, mellow yellow
Drinkin' hard liquor, broads get on my level
I'm hotter than the bottom side of of a whistlin' kettle
They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble
They sent me to hell and I shit on the devil
Tried to bury my Chevy box but I wonâ€™t buckle
Hey that's a deep hole bitch, bring a long shovel
I'm long gone, I'm grown-up and I'm gonna cut you
With a chrome blade if you wanna play then homes fuck you!
Fuck you til you can't take a shit,
Yea I'ma fuck everybody tsunami, better anchor the ship
And aim for the ankles and wrists, I came for the dangerous shit
I claim to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip
Slain from the pain of a trip it took to see Wayne in a whip
I became what I came to get the change for the change
I give a quarter for your thoughts, pre'ciate the contribution
Slumerican, I depreciate the Constitution
Alleviate the crew when I leave a page in ruins
To each his own I guess I own each and every room in
The house I built is full of hopes no "ifs"
So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts
If I'm generation X I'm selling X no pills
Dope man choppin' up lines ya don't sniff - You read 'em
I'm bringin' back booklets and hook-less lyrics
So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it
The "what he say's", "come again's", "what is that"
Come to Earth, touchdown! I might be your running back
Because you hollered "run it back"
Stay cool enough to wear toboggan's as a summer hat
Steady on the drum I rap, hope there's no one under that
Rock that I roll mosh-pit thow'd,
Girls on ya shoulders get topless at the shows
Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road
It only makes mud, raised around deer I know how to chase bucks
Baby sitter 16 taught me how to make fuck... at 7
I been raising hell so I can make it to heaven
Pick up a 2 liter but I only need the plastic
Know how to make bombs with aluminum and acid
Butterfly effect of a hurricane's magic
Tornado path in the rear view mirror of my 87 classic
I'm talkin' bout Gadsden,
Look mama no hands, I'm radioactive!
