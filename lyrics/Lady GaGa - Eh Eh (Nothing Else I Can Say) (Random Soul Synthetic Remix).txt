Boy, we've had a real good time and
I wish you the best on your way, eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh, hey

I have something that I love long-long
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And, eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so complicate-eh
I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other and that's funny, eh, eh, heh

I have something that I love long-long
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And, eh, there's nothing else I can say

Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)

I have something that I love long-long

Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh, eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh, eh (oh yeah), there's nothing else I can say
(Eh, eh) (eh, eh) Wish he'd never looked at me that way
(Eh, eh) (eh, eh)  There's nothing else I can say
(Eh, eh) (eh, eh)
