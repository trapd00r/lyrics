[Verse One]
S-T what I represent, N-Y
Hold it down for my peeps in the 'ville in Do or Die
For the record let it be known - chrome for sale
And any one of these niggas could blow your grill
Show your skill - you want war?  Hold your steel
You want more?  Unload techs, you all could feel
Raw deal, you all peel, run for the hills
Run for your shields, the battlefield's blastin at will

[Verse Two]
Smoke Dawg you know my name I'll
Be the same til the day that I'm laid down
Niggas push me to the point's gotta spray rounds
Takin shit like for a game, actin like clowns - always playin
You ain't bustin off, just shootin the breeze
Cause you scared of the repercussion after we squeeze
You ain't been through what I did just to get where I'm at
Streets where I rep and B-K where I be at

Chorus: Cocoa Brovas

Cause Brook-lyn where we live-at
Jugg-lin the good-crack (roo ROO)
Hand-lin a big-gat
My-army got my bi-zack

[overlapping Chorus]
Aiyyo, do your thang baby
Yeah yeah, we keep it hot
Yeah yeah, it's Cocoa Brovas, LB Fam
Aiyyo, aiyyo

[Verse Three - Mista Cheeks]
Stay up on the ground baby; see, bullets bein spitted
From us niggas in this game that's committed
Now which niggas widdit?  Enter my grounds
Let me show you what's really goin down - you bunch of clowns
Frontin like you really hot; understand kid you really not
Hype is all you really got - blow your spot
We pack it in, like a circus
Basically; niggas and they chicks love the way we work this
Spit that official rap shit - from the what - rap context
Knock it off with your nonsense
The hot shit I spit at you - is bound to hit you
And half the members in your crew, kid we out to get you
Dry an' Mill stay up in my sessions (all the time)
I stay finessin just in case I gotta teach a lesson, no question
Competition ain't nada
You make it hot for me and mines, see we make it hotter
Yo, aiyyo..

Chorus: Mista Cheeks (repeat 2X)

Queens is where I be-at (LB Fam)
I'm askin cousin where the weed-at (South-SIIIDE)
You got a blow well let me hit-it (aiyyo DUDE)
Some Jamaica unpermitted (black bandana, Yankee fitted)

[Cocoa Brovas]
What we live is what you read about
And any time of the day we bring the heaters out
My nigga stacked his dough, then he bought the Beemer out
Now you wonderin what Cocoa B's about?
(Cocoa BEEEEEZ, Cocoa BEEEEEEEEZ)

[Verse Four]
Cocoa B-R-double-O
K-L-Y-N with a couple HOEES
Tired of coppin weed bags, had enough of those
Invest in a few pounds or a couple O's
My niggas hustle most aggressive and keep the toast
On point for the B's and whenever beef approach
If you want me you can find me in the reefer smoke
Chrome close, anyone compete - meet your ghost

[Verse Five]
All my heights and capers, Smoky Lah be one of the greatest
Can't tell you all the things my niggas do for the papers
Why our Roc's look like Raiders and got models for ladies
Come through in fresh wears, always drivin Mercedes
Summer days and mountain bikes, wet Timbs on my feet
Move with the heat, Cocoa B's influence your speech
Four in a week, catch me in the park gettin scent
Federales stay all over the bar, behind the neck

Chorus: {repeat 2X}

Cause Brook-lyn where we live-at
Jugg-lin the good-crack (roo ROO)
Hand-lin a big-gat
My-army got my bi-zack

[Cocoa Brovas]
What we live is what you read about
And any time of the day we bring the heaters out
My nigga stacked up his dough and brought the Beemer out
And now you wonderin what Cocoa B's about?

[Mista Cheeks]
It's Cocoa Brovas, LB Fam y'all, c'mon
