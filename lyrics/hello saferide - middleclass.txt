You and me, let's steal a car
Let's rob a bank, let's travel far
Let's wear these shirts my grandpa used to wear
And then I'll be happy, I swear

I'll point the gun, you'll keep the engine running
I'll be running to you
You'll be saying: "Darling our haircuts aside
We are just like Bonnie and Clyde"

I'll probably feel bad for not
Taking the train but you'll say
"It's in the country and it's raining"

We'll kick open a cabin in the forest
I'll be scared, like I am
You'll put a flashlight under your chin
And say you're Son of Sam

And I'll slowly pull you out of your Fred Segal
And high on the fact that we're illegal
We'll make sweet loving sweeter, like we do
I'll say: "Baby, you're a criminal"
And you'll say: "So are you"

You and me, let's steal a car
But first, before we go that far
What's your name? Don't look so scared
Don't tell me you weren't thinking exactly the same
