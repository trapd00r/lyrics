[Intro - Joyo Velarde]
People are you ready?
Let's start the show
Don't worry 'bout the President, he can't stop us now
He can't stop us now

[Hook - Lyrics Born x4]
Callin' out to all area crew
We gonna make this shit happen right here right now

[Verse 1]
I wanna welcome y'all to ask me who the hell he is
And it's cool that y'all could make it to my new meeting
So take you time grab a table we got booth seating
Now allow me introduce me to my new people
See my name is Lyrics Born baby and I truly mean that
From the past from the future from the new and recent
You don't believe you can read page one in your leaflet
L-Y-R-C is funk philly born baby
Top of the eschelon of MCing
And I think on the topic we all in agreement
I'm never running from a challenge never been sheepish
In the rap hall of fame we gotta get me in
You gotta see me do my thang son I'm too fiendish
Flinging tune after tune till the wound deepens
I have a room of human beings feeling woozy like a fiend
Leaning, moving to the music in a fever screaming baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My life's a culmination of my past achievements
With a lotta heavy lifting, lotta deep breathing
A lotta courage, lotta doubts a lotta mixed feelings
A lotta love, a lotta luggage for a lotta reasons
I ain't forgot about the pain and all the mistreatment
I ain't forgot the little box they try to wiggle me in
I ain't forgot about the flower deep underneath the crowded streets
Sprouting in between the cracks scream and shout baby
Follow like a lock in, in the Colosseum
And you can positive ID 'em I'm in the mausoleum
You think I'll ever hang it up hoh body stop dreaming
You think I'll ever stop oh baby now you're reaching
I won't stop till I feel my lungs stop breathing
I won't stop till I feel my heart stop beating
I won't stop speaking this week and next week
And all false teeth, seeing eye dog
Stop seeing fire freezing, ice heat and fire palms reading
All bad fall free and clear from the mountain top screaming BABY

[Hook]
