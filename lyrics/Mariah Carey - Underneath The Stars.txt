One summer night, we ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
Where no one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)
Baby, yeah

Weak in the knees wrapped in the warm, gentle breeze
So shy, a bundle of butterflies
Flush with the heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heavy and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)
Ooh, whoa (Young love, young love)

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by

Reluctantly we said goodbye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was
Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting

And I mentioned I was yours
And you were my own (My own baby)
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark (As we lay, as we)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)

Ooh, whoa (Young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)

Underneath the stars
I was drifting, drifting, drifting
Underneath the stars (Young love, young love)
Underneath the stars
