Hey
hidden star
you're so near
yet so far 

I'm
just a girl
wanna dance
in your heart 

You
look so sad
what is wrong?
what went bad? 

I'd
soothe your pain
let me wash
it away 

kertos채e:
If I ever get close to you
If I ever get close to you
If I ever get 

kertos채e2:
Would you open up your window?
Would you smile and let me in?
Our life could be easy
we could have everything
we could walk upon the water
be heroes for all days
our life could be fantastic
love in a million shades
love in a million shades 

So why
don't you say
hello
once again 

Reach
out your hand
won't let go
till the end 

kertos채e
