So strange living now
Between days that don't exist
What's it for eyes are sore
Air so thick God I'm sick

Wait for, wait for it
You dinosaur, you wait for it
Wait for, wait for it
The meteor, you wait for it

Every day we don't have
They take it all from everyone
They say the beginning
Of the end it's in the book

Fulfilled, prophecy
It's been arranged for us
Money talks earth it burns
We're all done

Wait for, wait for it
You dinosaur, you wait for it
Wait for, wait for it
The meteor, you wait for it

Wait for, wait for it
Fire Above, we wait for it
Wait for, wait for it
To end us all, we wait for it

The fire above, above our head
The fire above our head
The fire above, above our head
The fire above our head
The fire above, above our head
The fire above our head
The fire above, above our head
The fire above our head
