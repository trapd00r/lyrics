[Announcer]
People are so busy listening to the music
They don’t see what’s going on right under their very feet
Below the ground…

[Intro: Psycho Les + Hostyle]
Ha…yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together
Screwball, Beatnuts collaboration
Be a screw to a ball and a beat to a nut, what
Check it, be a screw to a ball and a beat to a nut, what

[Verse 1: Hostyle]
Who’s the culprit? No shame in the game
Feel the pain but my rhymes get you numb like cocaine
It’s the black rose, the life I chose
Getting hoes, pushing cum right out they nose
Check the visuals, kid, as I illustrate, flow with hate
I suffer but never get enough of this ghetto livin’
Can’t give in, gotta get in where you fit in
Black blood within arm, picture which is written
Gotsta spill the beans, I’m lurkin’ out in Queens
Where niggas carry submachines under their jeans
Pumpin’ heems, Jake separate into teams
Flashlight beams, they spotty, K-9’s, pistol-grip shotties
G-locks while thugs carry rocks in their Reeboks
See lots of what’s going on, holding on
But that’s the last straw, I can’t take it no more
The world is sick and Queensbridge got the cure

Word up (Queensbridge and Corona)
Check it…

[Chorus: Hostyle]
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you reading my mind
To all you jum jugglers, pimp hustlers, murderers
Cops who’s corrupting us, life of crime
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind

[Verse 2: JuJu]
Yo, how the fuck you gon’ do what I do? You ain’t me
You niggas hate me, you niggas keep your guns on safety
And lately, you fuckin’ with my nerves and shit
With the way y’all been fuckin’ up my work and shit
You heard right, my team put it on dirt bike
Money hungry Germans with no life who gun fight
We love this country in the worst way
We gon’ bleed the bitch, corner to corner, Friday to Thursday
Jump off the highway when you see ten bikes
Poppin’ wheelies from Corona to Washington Heights
(You heard right) fuckin’ up my money ain’t cool
Now I gotta lift you, you know this game got rules

Yo, Po, what’s up? Tell me what’s on your mind, son
Word…

[Verse 3: Blaq Poet]
Check it, I’m going all out, no doubt, let me begin
Time to release the beast that rages within
I flips the script, I rip rhymes like none other
This is for my niggas, they buckwild for my brother
They’ve been fiendin’, while I was sitting back schemin’
Meditatin’, 9-7, fuck a waitin’
A lotta niggas might seem rough
But they’re a cream puff underneath that gangsta lean stuff
I’m the authentic, come check my lyrics
Ain’t no gimmicks or record company image
Rappers get blown up trying to take me out
I bust ‘em open and make all their flavor leak out
My rhymes are razor sharp, nothin’ to play with
The beats are nuts, so you critics can’t say shit

[Chorus: Hostyle]
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you reading my mind
To you jum jugglers, pimp hustlers, murderers
Cops who’s corrupting us, life of crime
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind

[Verse 4: Psycho Les]
Light the lah, we got mad trees (roll beez)
Lifted, in a cypher of parolees (the clique)
Crazy sick, done visit
The wrong place at the wrong time and catch blizzard
Approximately 20 deep, Spanish kids
Tall boys are mannequins, Jake start panickin’
Calling in for backup, useless
Pigs get smacked up, UH, left toothless
Cut off their walkie talkie conversation
I’m a big figure, you a crab nigga, that’s the situation
Pull out on your ass like a futon, crush you like a crouton
Bag you like Louis Vuitton (my shit)
Tremble the walls of your neighbor
Transaction, pushing more keys than Paul Schaffer
Set for action, smashing chickens with fat culos
Beatnuts and Screwball here to do y’all
Like that, baby—what
Yo, Hostyle, you know what I’m thinkin’…

[Chorus: Hostyle]
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you reading my mind
To all you jum jugglers, pimp hustlers, murderers
Cops who’s corrupting us, life of crime
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind
If you thinkin’ ‘bout cash, then you’re reading my mind

[Outro: Hostyle]
Yeah, it be a ball to a screw, a beat to a nut, what
Y’all niggas don’t want it
