If only we could fly...
Limp Bizkit style!
John Otto, take 'em to the Matthews Bridge!

Can you feel it?

My g-g-generation!
Get up!
My g-g-generation!
Are you ready?

Do you know where you are?
Welcome to the jungle, punk, take a look around
It's Limp Bizkit fuckin' up your town,
We downloaded the Shockwave,
For all the ladies in the cave to get your groove on (groove on)
And maybe I'm the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest
Well, guess who's next? (who)
Generation X, generation strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane (window pane)

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation

Hey kid, take my advice,
You don't want to step into a big pile of shit
Captain's drunk, your world is Titanic,
Floating on the funk, so get your groove on (groove on)
And maybe I am just a little fucked up
Life's just a little fucked up
Generation X, generation strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane (window pane)

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation

We don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation

Who gets the blame?
(Who gets the blame?)
You get the blame,
And I... get the blame
Who gets the blame?
(Who gets the blame?)
You get the blame,
And I... get the blame

But do you think we can fly?
(No way, no way)
Do you think we can fly?
(No way)
Do you... think we can fly?
Well, I do (I do)
I do... FLY!

DJ Lethal, bring it on!

Oh... yeah, come on!

So go ahead and talk shit
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk shit
About my g-g-generation

'Cause we don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation

We don't, don't give a fuck and
We won't ever give a fuck
Until you, you give a fuck about me
And my generation

Oh yeah!
