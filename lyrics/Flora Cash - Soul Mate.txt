Feels like we've lived a hundred lives before
Together and then decided on one more
Here on earth where everything is cruel
'Cause no one knows that this is just a school
For what it's worth, I'd die with you again
A hundred more times multiplied by ten
I hope I'll always have you in my mind
So that I know to find you every time

Soul mate, soul mate, soul mate
Won't you dance here with me while it grows late?
Put your head on my chest, that's your safe place
We'll fall deeper in love every day
From life unto life and for always
I'll be there when you need me around
When night finally comes and the leaves have fallen from the tree
Baby, you'll have me
Soul mate

Maybe there's not a brightness in this dark
Other than what is burning in this heart
But if we fight to keep this thing alive
Pretty sure there's no end to us in sight
I'll follow you into whatever is next
Or you can follow me, whatever's best
But first let's dance the dance that lovers do
Before we go to sleep and start anew

Soul mate, soul mate, soul mate
Won't you dance here with me while it grows late?
Put your head on my chest, that's your safe place
We'll fall deeper in love every day
From life unto life and for always
I'll be there when you need me around
When night finally comes and the leaves have fallen from the tree
Baby, you'll have me
Soul mate

I promise you that I'll find a way
To give you hope, to keep you close and safe
Keep you no matter come what may
And then we'll sleep in endless sheets of gray
(And then we'll sleep in endless sheets of gray)
