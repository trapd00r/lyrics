Come on in and take me on an override
Been stuck inside and up all night at Dave's
Now trouble's far away, and mother in her cage
And nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine

I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

Close the door and pull the shades
And climb the walls
Feel medicine heal the lines of age
I'm here and now I'm gone
I'm there and far beyond
And nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine
Nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine

I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

I'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretense over the (spire) why
On and connected
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating
Alone, lone, lone, lone
Alone, lone, lone, lone
Alone, lone, lone, lone

Breathe and take in and gently blow it on
Drink it down and swallow hard and gaze
Hold the potion up
Stare your shadow down
Remember to forget and then rename your shame

I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right

I'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretense over the (spire) why
On and connected
I'm overfloating now
Alone, lone, lone, lone
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating
Alone, lone, lone, lone
