My soul is not like a waterpark
It's big but surprisingly dark
It's not as forgivable as you once thought
You'd still be here if it really was
You really were a pile of rocks
On some planet so far up
How long did we even sit?
It's good I can't remember it
Sometimes I get sinister
Can't always be like Arthur
Sometimes I just feel sinister
Can't always turn to Arthur
New Mexico where I ran to
And closed my eyes and thought of you
And all the time we weren't friends
A parked car we made out against
So you went home and shut me out
And I grew up, backseats and mouths
And there ensued some other shit
I'm glad I don't remember it
Sometimes I get sinister
Can't understand Arthur
Sometimes I just feel sinister
Can't always be like Arthur
