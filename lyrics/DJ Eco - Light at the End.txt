[LightSkinMac11:]
Tryna be a humble negro
But you nigo got me lookin' like I'm from another eco
System booming, moving like torpedo
The allure of illegal, it's been a while
That's my pit
Treat em like my child, that's my bitch
Drive a nigga wild
Niggas don't know daps just pounds
You don't think I know you hate me now do you?
You don't think I know you hate me now do you?
I ain't never sold raw
Still can't explain what I saw
Packed a whole crib in the car
Just the thought of you gone leaves a permanent scar
I hope you don't hate me now do you?
I hope you don't hate me now do you?
Poppin' these pills for the thrill
Poppin' these pills for no feelin'
Seeing your father get killed will probably turn your heart so chilly
Hey, so now when I'm out, I'm colder than ever
Just hit up Uwanda, get pub forever
Hey

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Cartier Dave:]
First they love you, then they hate you again
Asking me where I've been, I've been about my shit
Hating ass niggas wanna doubt my shit
But want to count my grip
You niggas different
I've been moving with my pivot, tryna tally up my interest
Rate, my mind in a state to get my family through the gate
But niggas acting silly, they won't let me be great
So I focus on my own
Been about my grown shit since I was up in zone six
18 with a dream, ay
Hit the scene with a shopaholic fiend, bank schemes
How we make green
Lately I've been thinking 'bout her
But every time I call she don't even bother
Cause this thing we lost only makes it harder
Hey, I know you see me now
Hey, I know you see me now
He's the only thing that I think about
We did everything but couldn't see it out
That's the only reason you see me at all
Drinkin', smokin', trippin', livin', nigga
Two 9 til the endin'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Big KRIT:]
Another day of that same old shit
Bout to jump off the porch, I need more than most
Hit the SLAB, break a bitch for all she gross
Set up shop in your crib before you can butter your toast
Early mornin', never yawnin', gotta get to it
You could never see the light at the end of the tunnel til you been through it
Darling that's the art of war, more than just [?] Tsu-ing
And we ain't bout them games ho
All my partners ain't rap cause most of them down to let them thangs go
Chose the streets over beats cause the money tax free
And they heard the labels pull too many strings though
And I agree, but it wasn't for me, trappin' my nigga
And they reply, you better off rappin' my nigga
Real friends wanna see you in a foreign, scorin'
Cause waitin' on junkies is kinda borin', damn
I do this for my fam that could never make it
And all my homies that capped after at graduation
I know you tryna survive in the city where the skinny niggas die
And the police lowkey racist
Chasin', jump shot dreams
Crack vile stuck to the seams of our Air Force 1's
Wishin' it was gone
But that's life when you're young
I had to leave the slums and stay humble
