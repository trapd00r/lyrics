In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name

And do I dream again?
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind 

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet

And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

It's me they hear

Your/my spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind

He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware the Phantom of the Opera

In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery

...Were both in you... 

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is there/here
Inside your/my mind

He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, sing my angel of music, sing, sing for me!
