Culture Beat - Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

He'd say, "I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain"

Call me Mr. Raider, call me Mr. Wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me time and again

Fell the presence of the aura
Of the man none to compare
Loveless dying for a just to touch a hand
Or a moment to share

Can't deny the urge that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back the simple fact is
That I'm all that and I'm always near

One sexy can't perplex me now
You know who 'raw as if you didn't know before
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you then I want a little more

Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider, call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

He'd say, "I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain"

Girls are all over the world
They hope and pray and die for man
Like me cause I'm the one
Begotten son that breaks the mold

Get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you want to grab and hold
And squeeze real tight

Who's gonna be the one to save
You from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
Please, oh baby, please

You beg you want to stay
You got to get some caught
Up in the charm that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere

To run on the hook of my line
Yeah, I keep many females
Longing for a chance to win my heart
With sex and plenty
