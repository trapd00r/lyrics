Diamonds and fast cars
Money to burn
I got my head in the clouds
I got these thoughts to churn

Got my feet in the sand
I got a house on the hill
I got a headache like a mother
Twice the price of my thrills

And it's a cold day
It's a continental drift
I said this traffic is hell
Can you give me a lift?

And I'll try to paint a story
Got your pictures to tell
Yeah, you got to make a living
With what you bring yourself to sell

I got some genuine
Imitation bad apples
Free sample for your peace of mind
Only $9.95

I got my camera back from customs
Got my law fees up to date
Hell, they musta seen me comin'
Ain't this life so fuckin' great?

When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand, yeah
Well, I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathing while it can
But what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter

If I could touch the sky
Well, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me
I'd say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch

Gold and caviar
Now why don't you pour my apathy
And I'd have all my bases covered
If I could teach my hands to see

But now we're down in the deep end
Where they'd love to watch you drown
I said your laundry could use washing
We'll hang it up all over town

I said Hollywood's like a dryer
And we're down on Sunset Strip
And you'll be suckin' down the Clorox
Till your life's all nice and crisp

When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand, yeah
Well, I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathing while it can
But what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter

If I could touch the sky
Well, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me
I'd say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch

When the shit hit the fan
It was all I could stand, yeah
Well, I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathing while it can
But what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter

If I could touch the sky
Well, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me
I'd say just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch

Boy
