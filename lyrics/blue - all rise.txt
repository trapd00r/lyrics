Your Honour please 123
Gotta believe what I say
What I will tell
Happened just the other day 

I must confess
Cause I've had about enough
I need your help
Gotta make this here thing stop 

Baby I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now objection overruled

Here we go, oh baby

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lie that you denied
All rise - all rise
Three for the calls you've been - making it's
Four all the times you've been - faking
All rise - all rise
I'm gonna tell it to your face
I rest my case 

You're on the stand
With your back against the wall
Nowhere to run
And nobody you can call 

I just can't wait 
Now the case is open wide
You'll try to pray
But the jury will decide 

Baby I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you objection overruled 

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lie that you denied
All rise - all rise
Three for the calls you've been - making it's
Four all the times you've been - faking
All rise - all rise
I'm gonna tell it to your face
I rest my case 

So step back
Cos you don't know this cat
I know deep down that
You don't want me to react
I'll lay low
Leavin all my options open
The decision of the jury has not been spoken
Step in my house
You find that your stuff is gone
But in reality to whom does the stuff belong
I bring you into court
To preach my order
And you know that - you overstepped the border 

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lie that you denied
All rise - all rise
Three for the calls you've been making it's
Four all the times you've been faking
All rise - all rise 

What you say
Games you play
What you've done
When you're gone 

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lie that you denied
All rise - all rise
Three for the calls you've been making it's
Four all the times you've been faking
All rise - all rise
