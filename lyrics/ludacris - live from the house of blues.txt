[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
Play Da Song On The Radio

If It Get To Fast I'ma Take It Slow (Oh Oh)
If It Get To Fast I'ma Take It Slow Take It Slow (Yeeeah)
If It Get To Fast I'ma Get To Fast

[Verse 1: Shawnna]
Look I Got Da Feelin U Been Fienin My Body I See Its Leavin Da Party Now Tell Me Wat You Gonna Do
Somebody Told Me You Been Thinkin About Me And I've Been Thinkin Probably Could Be A Me On You 
So Come On Shorty We Could Creep A Bed Get Into Some More Freaky Shit 
Then We Could Go Back To Da Crib Take A Look How Live To Conceal Let Me Show You How Deep It Get 
Now We Could Do It Real Fast Or Could Do It Slow 
I Like When You Make It Last T'ill You Gotta Go 
He Like The Way I Move Dat Ass Then I Make It Poke Out To Smoke Out To Jag The We Roll 
And Took A Ride Down Lake Shore Drive Stay So High Flippin Through The City Nigga 
They Aint No I Stay So Fly Could Take Your Guy 
Cause They Know I Got Da Bomb And It Aint No Lie 

[Chorus x2: Bobby Valentino]

[Verse 2: Shawnna]

Wanna Fuck In Da Middle Of The Fight 
We Break Up To Make Up But When We Make Love We Suck And Nibble 
And We Bite But I Know I Gotta Chill Cause Now Im Seein Its Real And My Dude Checkin All Yo Phone Bills 
But Still I Know You Got A Girl Who Be All Off In Yo Grill She Be Checkin Through Your Pagers Stalkin All At The Crib Damn
