Here we go 
Yo  a day in the life of a player named Quik 
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick 
And just because I drink the 8  they say that I'm hopeless 
But I don't give a fuck  so blame it on the loc est 
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip 
Teddy Bear's in the house  so don't even trip 
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism 
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm 
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin off the hook *brrrrrring* 
And AMG is puttin down girl rhymes in his notebook 
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack *brrrrrring* 
I pick up the phone and it's the D (whassup nigga?) 
He said he's comin down at about two on the dot 
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot 
And now I'm soakin, a brother like the devestatin DJ Quik ain't jokin 
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken 
My name is Quik, but you can call me Daddy 
Yo open up the door, they think I'm Freak Man in a Caddy 
Now Freaky's in an El doggin shabbies in at Alco 
And everybody's sippin on a quart (here we go) 
D just came with a forty and a quart 
In addition to the three that Greedy just brought 
But I don't want to start early, so I just might 
put my forty in the freezer cause I want to get bent *tonite* 
Tonight's the night (yeah) *tonite* 
Tonight is the night *tonite* 
Tonight's the night (yo when we gon get bent) *tonite* 
Tonight is the night (aww yeah) 
And now I'm out of the tub up in a fancy freak 
Spray on some serious and put on my Girbaud jeans 
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim 
And it's a medium, fit me proper cause I'm nice and slim 
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin 
And I am steadily thinkin about the 8 that I'll be drinkin 
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful 
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful 
Ham is in the bedroom rollin up a stencil 
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil 
Freakie lit it up and hit it one two three 
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me 
It's the bomb!!! 
Yo I can feel my senses Get numb!!! 
Yo fuck the forty ounce I need some rum!!! 
I'm chillin like a villain Here I come!!! 
And that's how I'm livin 
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin real sporty 
Proper Friday evening and I'm ready to party 
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps 
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps 
(Yo what they in fo') A fin or a half 
(Yo shoot that ten nigga) Don't make me laugh 
Hi-see want a dove and he think that shit is funny 
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin niggaz money *tonite* 
Tonight's the night (yeah watch me fuck the hoe) *tonite* 
Tonight is the night (passin naturals on motherfuckers) *tonite* 
Tonight's the night (yo, I'm unfadable) *tonite* 
Tonight is the night (ahh let's break it down, so I can get funky) 
*tonite* 
Ahh yeah 
Givin em somethin they can roll on, hold on 
Wake up Saturday morning and I got a headache 
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank 
*last nite* Soon as I felt it comin on 
I should quit, it's true that a drunk ain't shit 
To the man up above, the whole thanks I give 
I'll never drink again if you just let me live 
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it 
Call it Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet 
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin 
Round and round I think I better sit down 
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint 
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't 
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door 
Some fine ass bitches comin over at four 
(I thought you ain't drinkin no more) Yeah right 
Because as soon as they come, we doin the same ol shit *tonite* 
Tonight's the night (yeah) *tonite* 
Tonight is the night (straight gettin fucked up, heyyy) *tonite* 
Tonight's the night (fuck that pass me that pina colada) *tonite* 
(man I don't want to fade that 8 Ball no mo) 
Tonight is the night (that shit be fuckin a nigga up) *tonite* 
Tonight's the night (ahh yeah nothin but a party and I'm kickin it)
