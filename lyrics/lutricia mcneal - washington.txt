I wanna go to Washington
I wanna meet the president
I'm feeling ten feet tall,
I'm indestructible to ya'll
I wanna go to Washington
I wanna meet the president
I'm on top of the world
I'm indestructible to ya'll
We all have ups and downs
Tough luck or the other way around
Some days are just not meant to be
That's the way it is, so listen to me
I wanna go-go, I wanna go-go now
I wanna go to Washington
I wanna meet the president
I'm feeling ten feet tall,
I'm indestructible to ya'll
I wanna go to Washington
I wanna meet the president
I'm on top of the world
I'm indestructible to ya'll
It's strange when people say
That they are living their lives
Day by day
I'm never satisfied
We've got to reach that all time high
I wanna go-go, I wanna go-go now
I wanna go to...
"I guess that I'm a moody girl. I got my ups and downs. This
is how I feel when I'm on a roll! Just go for it, take some
names and kick some butt!"
