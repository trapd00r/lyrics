TV Presenter:
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do

*Door opens*
Who's your daddy?

Hailie:
Daddy, what're you doing?

Eminem:
Haha

Eminem & Hailie:
Ok then! everybody, listen up

Eminem:
I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me?

Hailie:
Somebody, please help him
*giggle*
I think my dad gone crazy

There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to

Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall with my framed autograph
Sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall

I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off

Dr Dre:
Suck it Marshall

Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off

And launch one of these russians and that's all
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off

*Knocking* Haley, tell 'em baby

Hailie:
My dad's lost it

There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
(I think my dad gone crazy)
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(I think my dad gone crazy)

It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom* Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine
N goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'

Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch
Eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick
A million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record

I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring
In my nose then quit bringin' my flows
Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why I'm so mean?

If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

Hailey:
Dad

There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
(I think my dad gone crazy)
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(I think my dad gone crazy)

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, so what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter

Pret it at first, cuz when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once

And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as Bump 'n Grind comes on

More pain inside o' my brain
Than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade

And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"

Crazy
You're funny daddy
