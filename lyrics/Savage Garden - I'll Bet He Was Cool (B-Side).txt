You know every once in a while
I shoot the breeze I spend my time
I talk about silly things
I like to talk about Jesus Christ
'Cause I wonder what would happen if he passed you by
Would you be scared? Would you believe in him?
Would you bust your asses to get him institutionalized?

Well, I bet he'd be cool; I bet he'd be damn good looking
I bet that he smelt divine
I'm not talking about Calvin Klein's Obsession
Just one of those people smell good all the time
There's no reason why

What would he wear? Would he wear Tom Hilfiger?
Or be Urban Outfitted? I don't think so
Well, I bet he liked Gaultier
But you'd never find him in it; I bet he liked Gaultier

Lord I need your protection spend some time in my direction
I need your protection spend some time in my direction
I need your protection spend some time in my direction

You know every once and a while
I shoot the breeze I spend my time
I talk about silly things
And tonight I'd like to talk to you about Jesus Christ
'Cause I wonder how we'd deal if He just passed you by
I bet he'd be a star
I bet my star wars figures He would be a movie star
A Quentin Tarantino next-big-thing
Prima Donna, then He'd appear on Oprah
You know what? I don't think so

Could you imagine him hanging
Piccadilly Circus, Times Square, The Walk of Fame At
Christies He could easily become a regular
D'you know what? I don't think so
I bet my speeder bike he'd turn his back on all of that

Lord I need your protection spend some time in my direction
I need your protection spend some time in my direction
I need your protection spend some time in my direction

Some people have just got it
You know like standing next to Elvis Presley
Well then multiply that feeling by 1 million
And you know whatI'm talking about
Well I'll bet he was cool
Man I bet that cowboy was so damn good looking Baby
