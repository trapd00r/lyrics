Oh Baby

A single failure
A little slip
A misdemeanour
A little trip
Does this condemn me
Lock me away?
Before you turn the key
I have one more thing to say
To make amends
Maybe be friends


Everybody gets a second chance
The Circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
Take my chance and tell you
I'm sorry too

A little stumble
A little fall
Inconsequential
Nothing At All
Now there was someone
I heard him say
That the best laid plans
Sometimes go astray
So don't be surprised
If I offer you no alibis

Everybody gets a second chance
The Circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
Take my chance and tell you
I'm sorry too

Everybody gets a second chance
The circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
I'll take my chance and tell you I
Take my chance and tell you 
I love you

Everybody gets a second chance
The Circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
Take my chance and tell you
I'm sorry too

Everybody gets a second chance
The Circumstance to say I'm sorry
I'd like to tell you in advance
Take my chance and tell you
I'm sorry too

Everybody wants a
Everybody needs a
Everybody gets a second chance
