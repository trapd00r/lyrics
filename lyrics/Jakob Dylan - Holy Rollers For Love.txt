Down from the mountain out walking the flood
I see the future in this setting sun
Unfolded gardens uncover the earth as it was
Filled with canteens and tear gas
From this last voyage of us

Ain't no gentlemen here hiding wings
The devil himself would be puzzled to give
Any reasons to sink his fingers in
All this voodoo and black magic
Doing the work that was his

With battle songs filling their lungs
Move them out down under the sun
Give them tears for cherry red blood
Stack them old, we cradle them young
World is crazy or maybe just
Holy rollers for love

Split this ocean set these sails
It's down to the seabed we dazzle and fail
Hereafter's bringing more funerals than fairs
And it's a book of blank maps
That we're using to get us there

To the hilltops my daughter, my son
The rescue's too little to cover the slums
Cross this river deeper than it ever was
There's a pause in the evening
When prayers are supposed to be done

With battle songs filling their lungs
Move them out down under the sun
Give them tears for cherry red blood
Stack them old, we cradle them young
World is crazy or maybe just holy rollers for love
World is crazy or maybe she's holy rollers for love
World is crazy and making us holy rollers for love
