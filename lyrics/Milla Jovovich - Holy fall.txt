Brace myself
Space myself
Throw myself from the window
Throw myself from an aerial view
Of the highest
A holy fall
It was a holy fall...

-Holy fall
It was a holy fall that brought me here
Holy fall
It was a holy fall that brought me-

Wrinkled old doll face
On her way to the ball
I've got only myself
To thank for it all
I can picture you almost brushin up against me
Ican picture you almost touchin me
And it's not dark at all
It's not dark at all in here

Yeah, it brought me to this place
Into this gorgeous time
