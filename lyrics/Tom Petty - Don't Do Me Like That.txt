I was talkin' with a friend of mine
Said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so, then
Turned around and let him go
Then he said, "You'd better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size"

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I'll need ya, baby
Don't do me like that

Listen, honey, can you see
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in a public eye
Givin' someone else a try
And you know you'd better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I need you, baby
Don't do me like that

'Cause somewhere deep down inside, someone is sayin'
"Love doesn't last that long"
I have the feeling inside, night and day
And I can't take it no more

Listen, honey, can you see
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in a public eye
Givin' someone else a try
And you know you'd better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
I just might need you, honey
Don't do me like that

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby, don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby, oh, oh, oh
