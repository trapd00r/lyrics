"One-two.."
"One-two, shots to the chin... knock you out"
"One-two.." "Devestating!" "On da mic"
"One-two.." "The maker, owner!"
"Come on, now come on"

(Verse One: Guru)
Got you quiddear and ski-dared, fearin what we might do
And you can give me all mine in cash, that will suffice dude
In the streets deep, we roll through the city
Looks like it's time to eat, so yo who's with me?
Strictly, we keep it in the best perspective
Cause nowadays it's more than simply live and let live
A sedative, that's what these headcases need
Them rats'll get trapped soon as they taste the cheese
Black M. Casey fan, just pay us and scram
Watch us drop a new supply to up the daily demand
Phony critics wanna retract shit, once I spit again
And since we didn't finish the job, you gettin' hit again

(DJ Premier)
"One-two.." "Devestating!" "On da mic"
"One-two, one-two, shots to the chin... knock you out"
"One-two.." "Devestating!" "On da mic"
"One-two, one-two" "The maker, owner!"
"Come on, now come on"

(Verse Two: Guru)
You fuck, you didn't listen when I told you before
When it comes to dope tracks, we be holdin' the raw
Do somethin' stupid, and you'll be left holdin' your jaw
Put you punks on blast for not knowin' the law
Don't deny yourself, learn to apply yourself
Or end up by yourself, I multiply the wealth
I got the titles, deeds, licenses and policies
Complete ownership, Don Gurizzu they call me
Primo said that we should just, lock it all down
See the bigger picture, so we can profit all around
Now everybody's ridin' the dick, once I spit again
And since we didn't finish the job, you gettin' hit again

(DJ Premier)
"One-two.." "Devestating!" "On da mic"
"One-two, one-two, one-two, shots to the chin... knock you out"
"One-two.." "Devestating!" "On da mic"
"One-two, one-two" "The maker, owner!"
"Come on, now come on"

(Verse Three: Guru)
I be the owner of this style, owner of this talk, owner of this art
Peep the gully way that I walk
Many say that I rock, others hate but they jock
Now we racin the clock, po-po casin the spot
Call me greedy 'cause I feel like takin' a lot
Vindication, 'cause they be fabricatin a lot
From Cali to Canarsie, penthouse to the lobby
Roxbury to NC, Century Club to envy
Bout to take over the action, you know it's bout to happen
Cause our shit be hittin, and yours is plain ol'fashioned
I had no choice, but to spit again
GangStarr motherfucker, and you just got hit again

(DJ Premier)
"One-two.." "Devestating!" "On da mic"
"One-two, one-two, one-two, shots to the chin... knock you out"
"One-two.." "Devestating!" "On da mic"
"One-two, one-two" "The maker, owner!"
"Come on, now come on"

"Come on, now come on"
