[Verse: S. Carey]
I am in love with this place
But I fear for its grace
Shoot the sky
Opens up like the sea
And the resinous high
Bloodlines and divines
Will my kids see the trees?
Will the glen fall on me?

[Background: Justin Vernon]
(Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
Where I learned to be a light at dusk
Down here we’re careless and we’re primal
Where I learned to be a light at dusk)

[Chorus: S. Carey]
Crown the pines
I worship the sound
Mother cliffs
Adorn it, the ground
Spread the sand, my father’s land
