Why all those younger guys
Falling for you in burlesque disguise
Making you feel like you're thirty
Just being dirty, you think I care

Who was that millionaire
Showing you his piles of golden hair
He was so rich but uneasy
Trying to tease me but I don't care

Painting your face
Hiding the pace of life
Beautiful past under the mask
You wear

You're a movie star who's caught in a dream
The silver screen, you know what I mean
You're a movie star who's caught in a dream
The silver screen, you know what I mean

How can you sleep at night
Knowing the secrets, secrets, secrets
Secrets you lock up tight
Taking ya chip off ya shoulder
It's good being older without a care

Painting your face
Hiding the pace of life
Beautiful past under the mask
That you wear, yeah

You're a movie star who's caught in a dream
The silver screen, you know what I mean
You're a movie star who's caught in a dream
The silver screen, you know what I mean

You're a movie star who's caught in a dream
The silver screen, you know what I mean
You're a movie star who's caught in a dream
The silver screen, you know what I mean...
