Fine white sheep and candles too
Bets in a straight row, one each for you
No one talks straight at you just outside the hallway
Flowers in the window, red and blue
Most people here still think of you
No bleeding eyes, and they pass
Bang your head, against the glass

What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you

From the doorway watching you sleep
Before you wake up, not when you eat
Keep it straight, wipe your mouth
Keep it down, boys don't shout

What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you

From the doorway watching you sleep
Before you wake up, not when you eat
Keep it straight, wipe your mouth
Keep it down, boys don't shout

What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you
What can I do, I am losing you
