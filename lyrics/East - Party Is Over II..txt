[Hook: KEV NISH]
Say: I-I-I-I-I Party all day and all n-n-n-night,
And I just wanna play my whole li-li-life,
I Party, I-I-I-I-I Party, I-I-I-I-I Party

[Verse 1: KEV NISH]
Lets party baby, tell the dj get the party crazy
I'm fellin faded like a classic pair of Ben Davis
(All Night) Music's bangin, (All Night) hella ladies
I'm navigating through them girls like a new Mercedes
(Later) My games' in over drive, baby girl is so divine
Last shot it's overtime, Patron and Henney is suicide
So sip it baby, do or dieeeee, its just you and i-i-i-i
Like a pair of di-i-i-ce, we can let it ride

[repeat hook]

[Verse 2: PROHGRESS]
The club going insane, feelin that bass, pushing that 808
Mama what's my name, ride this train, FM make ya shake that thang,
I wanna hear you scream, AMF burn ya lips like gasoline,
Feelin so good like I'm in my dreams, make ya see 3 like a sippin on lean
We back and ya know its US, too much now throw it up
Then I'm back up on it, sippin that tonic, baby fill my cup
And ya don't stop, git it, git it
I say don't stop, git it, git it
Party don't sleep 7 days a week cuz that beat so bad that it got me trippin'

[Bridge - DB TONIK]
Just open your mind, ay ay ay
Just open your eyes, ay ay ay

Your so blind, ay ay ay
Just open your eyes
Just for a short while

[repeat hook]

[Verse 3: IZ]
Club lights spinnin', locs on, hoes grinnin'
White tee's nicely pressed, I just might be,
The right G that flow cool, IZ there's no 2
Roll through, Fly Gang, sideways, crime pays
Creepin' on yo stacks so homie don't relax,
The straps in the jack' cuz I came thru the back
Where ever i go, the shotgun still rolls
Cops come to the shows and yall know how it goes

[Verse 4: J-SPLIF]
Its a jungle in this building from the window to the wall (wall)
Turn the music up lets rock the party cuz its on (on)
My game is through the roof like j-j-Jordan in the zone
Fresh Prince of Hollywood, Ch-ch-ch-Chillin on my throne
