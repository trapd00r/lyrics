I wonder
I still wonder
If you loved me
If you loved me

I wonder
Always wonder
If you ever will let me know

Will I ever see, ever see
A message sent from you to me

I travel
I still travel
With a wonder
With my wonder

I travel
Always with me
A message
Crumble message

That follows me
With stupid deliver
Do you from it

I compare love
I still compare love
So I wonder
I have to wonder
