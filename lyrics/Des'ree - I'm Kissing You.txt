Pride can stand a thousand trials
The strong will never fall
But watching stars without you
My soul cries

Heaving heart is full of pain
Ooh, ooh, the aching
'Cause I'm kissing you, ooh
I'm kissing you, ooh

Touch me deep, pure and true
Gift to me forever
'Cause I'm kissing you, ooh
I'm kissing you, ooh

Where are you now
Where are you now
'Cause I'm kissing you
I'm kissing you, ooh
