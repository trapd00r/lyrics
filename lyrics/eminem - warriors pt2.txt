It's like a throne that he don't even own 
He won't sit down, given the crown he just throws it around 
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing 
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry 
He don't want the fame dont want the loot he's in this for a sport 
Runnin suckaz with the competition round the court 
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it 
And you can't love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it 
You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short 
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it 
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys 
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it 

[Chorus - Nate Dogg] 
This is the story of a warrior you know you know it 
True warrior go ahead make some noise 
It ain't nuttin to be makin niggaz paranoid 
Hit your corner wit more weapons I don't need my boyz 
I'm doin about 120 on the fast lane 
Kick back just relax let me do my thang 
Don't give a fuck about you suckaz gotta maintain 
Money, power and respect in this rap game 

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks] 
He's straight outta the neighborhood but niggaz hate 
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate 
Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate 
And he hops in a 100 thousands with a nigga's gate 
House with just a bigger gate , houndin him was a big mistake 
He won't surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break 
Cause he horrendous when they wouldn't lend a helpin hand 
So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan 
Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name 
When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game 
And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them 
G-Unit records ain't no motherfuckin stoppin them 

[Chorus - Nate Dogg] 
This is the story of a warrior you know you know it 
True warrior go ahead make some noise 
It ain't nuttin to be makin niggaz paranoid 
Hit your corner wit more weapons I don't need my boyz 
I'm doin about 120 on the fast lane 
Kick back just relax let me do my thang 
Don't give a fuck about you suckaz gotta maintain 
Money, power and respect in this rap game 

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent] 
These niggaz got a Lot of Nothin 
So those niggaz from the hood act like we owe 'em somethin 
They talk crazy til we send this nigga in there to fuck 'em 
Ask 'em if theres a problem and they'll say naw its nothin 
He's been tryin to help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck 'em 
He don't care how they feel they're makin 'em love 'em 
He hold it down on his own the kid is really thuggin 
He's rich now, he ain't change since these niggaz buggin 
He pull a clip everythin niggaz try to buck him 
Keep ya pistols on ya hip I show you we ain't tuck em 
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him 
Try to catch 'em slippin, they creepin and he start bustin 

[Chorus - Nate Dogg] 
This is the story of a warrior you know you know it 
True warrior go ahead make some noise 
It ain't nuttin to be makin niggaz paranoid 
Hit your corner wit more weapons I don't need my boyz 
I'm doin about 120 on the fast lane 
Kick back just relax let me do my thang 
Don't give a fuck about you suckaz gotta maintain 
Money, power and respect in this rap game 

[Nate Dogg] 
I can give you somethin you can talk about 
I can turn this smile upside down 
You ain't no G-Unit fuckin clown 
I can take your girl until I turn her out 
The bootey layed all out 
I can give you fuckin somethin to be mad about 
And buy her rings and I back out 
With my DNA all in her mouth
