"Hip hop" "hip hop" "is dead" 
"Hip...hip hop" "hip hop" "is dead" 
"Hip...hip hop" "hip...hip hop" "is dead" 
"Hip...hip hop" "hip hop" "hip hop" 

If hip hop should die before I wake 
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK 
Roll to every station, murder the DJ 
Roll to every station, murder the DJ.

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ.

Hip hop just died this mornin' 
And she's dead, she's dead.

Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party, and die in the same corner 
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama 
Rich ass niggas is ridin' with 3 llamas 
Revenge in their eyes, Hennesy and the ganja 
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin' hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind 
Grindin' hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind 
Grindin' hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up 
Any ghetto will tell you Nas helped grow us up 
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks 
Hundred million in billin', I helped build 'em up 
Gave my nigga my right, I could have gave left 
So like my girl Foxy, a nigga went Def 
So nigga, who's your top ten? 
Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren? 

If hip hop should die before I wake 
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK 
Roll to every station, murder the DJ 
Roll to every station, murder the DJ.

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ.

Hip hop just died this mornin' 
And she's dead, she's dead.

The bigger the cat, the bigger the pillin' 
Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin' 
What influenced my raps? Stick up's and killin's 
Kidnappin's, project buildin's, drug dealin's 
Criticize that, why is that? 
Cuz now rap is compared to legitimized crack 
Cuz we love to talk on ass we gettin' 
Most intellectuals will only half listen 
So you can't blame jazz musicians 
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues 
Oh I think they like me...in my white teeth  
You can't ice me, we here for life B 
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that we not takin' it lightly 
If hip hop should die we die together 
Bodies in the morgue lie together 
All together now.

If hip hop should die before I wake 
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK 
Roll to every station, murder the DJ 
Roll to every station, murder the DJ.

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ.

Hip hop just died this mornin' 
Hip hop just died this mornin' 
Hip hop just died this mornin' 
And she's dead, she's dead.

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game 
Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business 
If it got where it started 
So we all gather here for the dearly departed 
Hip hopper since a toddler 
One homeboy became a man then a mobster 
If the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka 
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a rasta 
Went from turntables to mp3s 
From "Beat Street" to commercials on Mickey D's 
From gold cables to Jacobs 
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts 
I'm lookin' over my shoulder 
It's about 80 peoples from my hood that showed up 
And they came to show love 
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut.
