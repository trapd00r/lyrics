Beware the danger it lurks for those who get swept away 
The dreamers get punished most by the truth 
They say it's all in the little ways one reveals their 
Love's gone away, love's gone away 

When my hand was in you hand my heart was pure, 
Now I see a different man, rewriting memories 
The dogs run down the beach and all I'm left with is
Sand in my shoes, sand in my shoes 

'Cuz fools like me 
How we love blindly 
And the cracks don't count 
It's gotta break in front of me 

Now I recall that time at the cafe 
The thunderstorm outside words you could never say 
they hold the loudest tones 
You say you'll write 
but it's ink on a page 
just ink on a page 

But, fools like me 
how we love blindly 
and the cracks don't count 
it's gotta break in front of me 

And tick tock the time 
Distant look grows in your eyes 
fools never ask afraid what lurks in your mind 

I always knew 
Somehow always knew 
I always knew the truth. 

'Cuz fools like me 
How we never see 
and the cracks don't count 
its gotta break in front of me 
and It's breaking, 
It's breaking 
It's breaking 

It's gotta break for me to see 
At least I can say 
I was not afraid 
I loved you all the way 
And I'd pick the fool any day
