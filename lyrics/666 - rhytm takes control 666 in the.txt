Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo!
I'm in the studio with my brother
The half-raciotic.
You know the fraction of black skin, and a smite of white.
It's my brother Kool Nick
We're about to drop some science on this track
About God and what not,
You know, the world.
So watch me get busy.

Step up, bow your head, and be grateful
You're hungry for knowledge?
I'm serving a plateful.
A 12 cross meal on a black plate of wax so
MC the feed
Then sit back and relax.
And try and not jest the data I fed you.
I act and react this way 'cause I'm bred to.
The color of my skin, something I take pride in
Still my people insist on hidin'
Behind me, American Dream and it's lie
The home of the free, and mom's apple pie.
I thought this was the melting pot?
I guess not.
King stood up for his rights and he got shot.

[CHORUS:]
(Yeah)
I speak no evil.
(Yeah)
Yo Nick Jr. (?Pagel?) man. Step to 'em.

This world is crazy and it must be sick.
Be like Nick, you get righteous real quick.
Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Baptists.
Protestants, Hericristas, Catholics.
Seek salvation, and repentence.
This rhyme is from the heart and I meant this.
Jesus, shedded his blood for me.
He hung on the cross,
Yo, you know the story.
Nowadays, a lot of people are tryin'
To worship Satan, but you're gonna fry in
HELL
Imagine burnin' up forever
Forecast. this evenin'
There's no change in weather.
Damn the devil
Will never twist this
Mind, with the mark of the beast or the 666
To God, there's no one equal.
That's why I speak no evil.

[CHORUS]

Listen to the story of my savior
And how he gave up
Life
So you could live.
That's a hell of a gift to give.
Now as I take a look around
And I don't see many people down
With my cause,
Huh, that's scary.
Tryin' to diss the son of Mary?
You're being lured so take the bait and..
Fall into the trap of Satan.
Then your life is over.. without no sequel
That's why I speak no evil.

[CHORUS]

Ending (Yo!)
This environment's strange.
Brothers gettin shanked on the streets for gold chains.
Some smoke crack, cocaine, and jumbos.
Brain's so fried when they talk they mumble.
How could it be?
Society
Has formed a place
Where none of us wanna be.
People gettin' judged by the color of skin tone.
It wasn't like this way back with the Flintstones.
Mmm. Some times it's hard
I get kept back
'cause I'm half black.
People can't accept that.
Yo. Accept me for what I am.
And what can I do?
'cause none of 'em give a damn.
All they want is to drive a Mercedes.
Have a million dollars
And live like the Brady's.
But anyways, time is windin'
Not rewindin'
Look in your heart and start findin'
Peace and love, no matter what you're greed is
Understand
The knowledge at hand and believe this.

[CHORUS]

Word up.
We got my man Loafy in the house.
My boy Chris
My brother Lo-Dogg, My brother Fry
My lady, T., My brother Sean in the place.
Yo what's up.
Got my brother E-lo up in the corner over there.
Ha ha ha ha! Yo!
Can't forget Steve Rock.
Yo!
Can't forget Kevin Mack.
I'd like to send a shout out to the almighty supreme, being God.
Word up. 'cause ya know ya rules.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we outta here
