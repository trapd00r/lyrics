Voices hard and hollow 
Colder than I ever was before
I'm leaving you pieces
Of love to come for more

You always find me miles from where
I said you must let go
Or nothing sounds convincing
To the one you can't say no

Who could possibly save
Save us from madness
Love is the common name
Again, we depend
On the one to blame

It's bittersweet to swallow
Kindness as a consequence of guilt
So gather up the pieces
of your last and dying will
And prepare yourself to live with
whatever follows pain

Who could possibly save
Save us from madness
Love is the common name
Again, we depend
On the to blame
