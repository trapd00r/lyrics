Na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 

I was heading down to Spring Street 
With a suitcase in my hand 
And filled with love and life and grand delusions 
I knew you'd understand 

When I left you by the stairwell 
And your eyes were wet with tears 
Mother, you knew you had to let me go 
Even after all these years 

And we sing
Na na na na na na na 
And she said
Na na na na na na na 
And walk on
Na na na na na na na 
You're alright
Na na na na na na na 

And I found myself a new life 
And I've been living with some friends 
And we hold on to dreams and live like kings 
Like the days will never end 

And I left him by the statue 
And his eyes were filled with tears 
Lover, you knew you had to let me go 
Even after all these years 

And we sing
Na na na na na na na 
And he said
Na na na na na na na 
We'll walk on
Na na na na na na na 
You're alright
Na na na na na na na 

And everything changes 
And friends become strangers 
And what we hold so dear slips away 
The past keeps on fading 
But I'll never forget you 
It's hard to see that you're a part of me 
Even when we have to say 

Na na na na na na na 
And walk on
Na na na na na na na 
And we sing
Na na na na na na na 
You're alright
Na na na na na na na 

And I moved out of the city 
To start a family of my own 
And when I look into my daughter's eyes 
I don't feel so alone 
And as I walk her down to Spring Street 
And she holds on to my hand 
Mother, you knew my eyes would be wet with tears 
And now I understand 

Na na na, na na na na na na na 
And I said
Na na na na na na na 
Walk on
Na na na na na na na 
And thank you
Na na na na na na na 

And walk on 
We're alright 
And hold on 
Na na na na na na na
