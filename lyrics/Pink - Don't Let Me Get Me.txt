Never win first place,
I don't support the team,
I can't take direction,
And my socks are never clean.

Teachers dated me.
My parents hated me.
I was always in a fight
'Cause I can't do nothin' right.

Every day I fought a war against the mirror,
I can't take the person starin' back at me.

I'm a hazard to myself...
Don't let me get me.
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself.

So irritating.
Don't wanna be my friend no more,
I wanna be somebody else,
I wanna be somebody else, yeah...

L.A. told me,
"You'll be a pop star.
All you have to change
Is everything you are."

Tired of being compared
To damn Britney Spears.
She's so pretty,
That just ain't me...

So doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin'?
A day in the life of someone else.

'Cause I'm a hazard to myself...
Don't let me get me (No).
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself.

So irritating (No).
Don't wanna be my friend no more,
I wanna be somebody else (Yeah).

Don't let me get me (Don't let me).
I'm my own worst enemy (Oh),
It's bad when you annoy yourself. 

So irritating.
Don't wanna be my friend no more, 
I wanna be somebody else.

So doctor, doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin'?
A day in the life of someone else.
Don't let me get me...

Oh, I'm a hazard to myself, yeah...
Don't let me get me.
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself (Yourself).

So irritating (So irritating). 
Don't wanna be my friend no more (Don't, don't),
I wanna be somebody else.

Don't let me get me (Don't let, don't let)... 
I'm my own worst enemy (Don't let me get me),
It's bad when you annoy yourself (It's bad, it's so bad).

So irritating (Oh).
Don't wanna be my friend no more (I),
I wanna be somebody else. 

(Don't let me get me, don't let me get me)
I'm my own worst enemy,
It's bad when you annoy yourself.
