Mr Potato Head
I Made you

Mr Potato Head
I Made you

There's no batteries in my back
I show you *****s how I move
50 ain't gangsta
Lloyd Banks ain't gangsta
Yayo ain't gangsta
Young Buck you know you ain't gangsta

You at what ya *****s make
Ain't that a bitch
Created a monster
Kicked me outta G-Unit
Put me in converse
Matta fact give me a gimme a dick
Just like Olivia so you can suck my shit
Gimme a pen
So I can be the hardest in the click
Whined me up ***** then gimme some lips
So I can talk about ya faggot
*****S ain't no thugs
While I'm at it tell Young Buck gimme some white gloves
So I can cover my fingerprints in ya blood
I need a get away car you can put it on dubs
Make sure its got a stash for the 38 snub
And a Banks album 'cause that's where I got my buzz
Gimme muscles like 50
Gimme Yayo hands
Gimme a collection plate for Ma$e advance
Gimme some glass so I watch Ma$e dance (?????)
Who movin? you singing?
***** Gimme ya fans
Gimme a tattoo tear
Gimme some ears so I can hear police talkin' when you disappear

Yayo: And I'd like to thank game 'cause hes mr potato head of the year. put together gangsta

Rolling through Connecticut
In a stolen mini van
Stop at his house
I don't see many men
Matta fact I don't see any men
One plain clothed cop call him Lieutenant Dan
Officer why ya man tryna beat up my fans?
Makin' me 5 times platinum wasn't part of his plan
Same shit same snitch
You know how it goes
I smell a rat even if you take off my nose
And I bet every quarter in my piggy bank
Lloyd told NYPD who got 50 shanked
Next time when the lights go out
I'm pulling a desert eagle when the knives come out
Watch that man get ta tussling and the mice run out
Don't gamble with ya life when my dice roll out

I made you
I made you
I made you
I made you
Mr Potato Head
I Made you
Yes I Made you
Mr Potato Head
I Made you
I Made you
Mr Potato Head
I Made you

There's no batteries in my back
I show you *****s how I move
50 ain't gangsta
Lloyd Banks ain't gangsta
Yayo ain't gangsta
Young Buck you know you ain't gangsta
