Mothers singing requiems at the Methodist church
Fathers downstairs making love to Nazi's in the dirt
Gotta see my pharmacist at the liquor store
Couple six-packs then I won't think anymore

Kill silhouette town
Kill silhouette town

Thought it was pretty funny when James got put away
Never thought that they might be coming back for us someday
Leave it on my doorstep take it to my room
Saw it coming all the time, my sacrificial doom

Kill silhouette town
Kill silhouette town

Let me dig my own grave have a little fun
You can talk to Jesus, i'll drink beer in the sun
I've gotta see my pharmacist at the liquor store
Couple six-pack's and I won't think anymore
