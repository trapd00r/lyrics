Yeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas' mamas...
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi:]
A baby drama mama, don't like me
She doing things like having her boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rip you up, start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts
On my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter
Got a special thing going on
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full-grown
Hope that we feel this
Feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever? Forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school,
And graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi:]
"Look at the way he treats me", shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass homegirls got they ass up in creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And then you and your girl ain't speaking no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about, jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating, beating, in the end to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on?
You keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

[Andre 3000 2x:]
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
