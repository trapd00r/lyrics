MY DAYDREAM
WAS INTERRUPT
WITH YOUR KISS
SOME TIMES I WISH
I  WAS MORE SIMPLE HEARTED THAN THIS
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I AM TOO LATE FOR MY LIFE
THEN I REDRAW
IN TO MY SELF FOR A WHILE

SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF THERE´LL EVER
COME A TIME WHEN YOU WONT BE AROUND
BECAUSE SOMETIMES I
HAVENT GOT ANY PLACE TO HIDE
WHERE I CAN HEAL MY MIND
AND ITS WHEN I NEED YOU MOST INSIDE

I´D WISH I WOULD´NT DREAM THAT MUTCH TONIGHT
I LIE AWAKE STARRING AT THE CEILING
ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
SOMETIMES I´D WISH THERE WAS A PLANET
TO WHERE I COULD TRAVEL WHEN I RUN OUT OF GASOLIN

SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF THERE´LL EVER
COME A TIME WHEN YOU WONT BE AROUND
BECAUSENSOMETIMES I
HAVENT GOT ANY PLACE TO HIDE
WHERE I CAN HEAL MY MIND
AND ITS WHEN I NEED YOU MOST INSIDE
