I won't be neglected
I won't be denied
The pleasure of your kisses
The pleasure of your smile

I think you take for granted
I'll always be here
Just because I love you
It doesn't mean I won't disappear

Been so long ... of missin' you, baby
Been so long ... of missin' you, baby

Thoughts and mellow memories
Of once upon a time
Slowly creepin' on me
And they linger on my mind

Just let somebody love you
I just don't know why
Whenever I get close to you
You want to run and hide

It's been so long ... of missin' you, baby
It's been so long ... of missin' you, baby
It's been so long ... of missin' you, baby
It's been so long ... of missin' you, baby

We began lovers' dance
The road was smooth to romance
And we sang love sweet song every day

I believe that love would stay in my heart
Now it's torn all apart
It's gone away, I can't stay, I've got to say
I don't believe that you could do me this way

Now don't you understand
I'm in need of comfort
The comfort of your hand in mine
And what I feel inside
Why don't you come closer
I can't hide

Been so long
Been so long ... can't hide
Been so long
Been so long ... it's too long, won't you come on, baby
Been so long ... won't you come home, see about me
See about me

Been so long
