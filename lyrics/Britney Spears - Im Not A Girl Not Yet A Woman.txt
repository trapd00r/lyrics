(Verse 1)
I used to think, I had the answers to everything
But now I know, life doesn't always go my way
Yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize

(Chorus)
I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between, I'm not a girl

(Verse 2)
There is no need to protect me
Its time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than u know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

(Chorus)
I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between, I'm not a girl

(Bridge)
But if u look at me closely
You will see it my eyes
This girl will always find her way 

(Chorus)
I'm not a girl
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe
Not Yet a woman
I'm just tryin to find the woman in me, yeah
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between 

I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between 

I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
