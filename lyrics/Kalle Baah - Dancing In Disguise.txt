You never win the race if you walk in someone's footprints
Or ever stand the pace if you don't start where it begins

The muckraker dancing tonight, you can hardly see it but she's there
Smokey room, misty light, always play underhand
No she'll never understand

Variety is a spice of life - tell me how you mean... you know
Acting on a silverscreen, so tell me Mrs Slowcoach and smart Alec
How come when you wanna walk you walk out of step

The zenith of your career are long gone now
You can hardly see it but it's true
In danger zone you walk alone
Just like a bloodsucker, a backbiting bacherlor
