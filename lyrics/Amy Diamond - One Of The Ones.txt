Have you read the news today?
So much hate going round
Ain't no love to be found
Is everybody out of faith?
Spending most of their lives
Trying to waste it

There might be trouble on the way, ey
But I'll be damned if I surrender

Rather be one of the ones
That keeps on trying
Rather be one of the few
That won't stop fighting
Rather be one of the ones
That keeps surviving
I'll be around
Stand my ground
Come whatever

Some say: Choose your ground
Don't go down the wrong way
Life ain't easy
But I don't wanna be afraid
If I bend, if I break
I will learn from mistakes

When there's a cloud up in the sky, I
Go looking for the silver lining

Rather be one of the ones
That keeps on trying
Rather be one of the few
That won't stop fighting
Rather be one of the ones
That keeps surviving
I'll be around
Stand my ground
Come whatever

I won't stop and I won't give in
Optimist 'til the very end
Ain't nobody gonna
Change the way I am
(People hating)
People hating
(Bonds are breaking)
Bonds are breaking
(Where's the pride in that?)
Where's the pride in that?

There might be trouble on the way
But I'll be damned if I surrender

Rather be one of the ones
That keeps on trying
Rather be one of the few
That won't stop fighting
Rather be one of the ones
That keeps surviving
I'll be around
Stand my ground
Come whatever

Rather be one of the ones
That keeps on trying
Rather be one of the few
That won't stop fighting
Rather be one of the ones
That keeps surviving
I'll be around
Stand my ground
Come whatever
