Tokyo, oh Tokyo
I'm aware of your deadly presence
I see you've come with the presents
And brought along your mother too

Tokyo, oh Tokyo
I'm afraid of what's going to happen
When every bedroom flattens
And everything falls in the sea
(ありがとう　ございます)

Tokyo, oh Tokyo
You're too tall of a truth to take in
Since we're grounded in a daydream
Can't wait 'til we meet up again
