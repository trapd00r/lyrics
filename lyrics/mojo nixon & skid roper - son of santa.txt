Well, the Son of Santa got outta San Quentin
And man, dontcha think it's mighty fittin' that
He got released, Lord, for Christmas Eve
Well, his old man's gonna be mighty upset
When he finds out the state's lost their bettin'
And all them Women Voters gonna start to grieve

Son of Santa and the Reindeer Rockers
Are bustin' outta jail, nothin's gonna stop 'em
Hoppin' and a boppin', rockin' all Christmas Eve
Rockin' in the New Year, gimme some more beers
You can't buy the records at Sears
Son of Santa and the Reindeer Rockers tonight

Well, the President in D.C.
He said "Look here, boys, I don't see
What all this commotion is"
Well, y'know, them senators' wives, man, they come walkin' around Ronnie
Y'know what they said, they said, "Ronnie?"
They said, "Ronnie? Ronnie-boy! Oh, Turkey-neck!"
Well, the Son of Santa's out on the streets
Givin' the kids more than sweets
And he's a-fillin up the stockings with jizz

Son of Santa and the Reindeer Rockers
Are bustin' outta jail, nothin's gonna stop 'em
Hoppin' and a boppin', rockin' all Christmas Eve
Rockin' in the New Year, gimme some more beers
You can't buy the records at Sears
Son of Santa and the Reindeer Rockers tonight

I was drinkin' a Fanta with the Son of Santa
Down in Louisiana
He said, "Boy, I got somethin' here bigger than King Kong"
"Bigger than King Kong, huh?"
"That's right, boy"
He said, "Hey, white boy, you best be loud"
He said, "Hey, white boy, you better be proud
Or I'll bring you a guitar that's made in Hong Kong"

Son of Santa and the Reindeer Rockers
Are bustin' outta jail, nothin's gonna stop 'em
Hoppin' and a boppin', rockin' all Christmas Eve
