(Yeah alright)

It's kinda funny, how life can change
Can flip 180 in a matter of days

Sometimes love works in mysterious ways
One day you wake up gone without a trace

I refuse to give up, I refuse to give in (no)
You're my everything
I don't wanna give up, I don't wanna give in (oh)
So everybody's sing

one love for the mothers pride 
one love for the times we cried
one love gotta stay alive 
I will survive
one love for the city streets 
one love for the hip hop beats 
one love, oh I do believe 
one love is all we need

Late at night I'm still wide awake
Think this is far more than I can take

I thought my heart could never break (never break)
Now I know that's one big mistake

I refuse to give up, I refuse to give in (oh oh)
You're my everything (Thats right, c'mon)
I don't wanna give up, I don't wanna give in (oh no)
Everybody's sing

One love for the mothers pride 
One love for the times we cried
One love gotta stay alive (ooooohhhhhhh!)
I will survive
One love for the city streets 
One love for the hip hop beats 
One love (one love) Oh I do believe 
One love is all we need

(Thats right)
Baby just love me, love me, love me
Baby just hold me, hold me, hold me
Ooooohhhhhhh love me, love me, love me (oh yeah) One love

Baby just love me, love me, love me (love me)
Baby just hold me, hold me, hold me
Ooooohhhhhhh love me, love me, love me (oh)

One love for the mothers pride 
One love for the times we cry
One love gotta stay alive (oh)
I will survive
One love for the city streets 
One love (one love) for the hip hop beats 
One love (one love) oh I do believe 
One love is all we need

One love for the mothers pride (ooooooooooooooooooo oh oh oh)
One love for the times we cry
One love gotta stay alive (ooh yeah)
I will survive
One love (one love) for the city streets 
One love (one looooooooooooooooove yeah) for the hip hop beats 
One love oh I do believe 
One love is all we need.
