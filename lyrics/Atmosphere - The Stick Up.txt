(What I'm sayin' is the most. I'm a player from coast to coast. So you ladies, make a toast. Here's to you, you, you you. If the truth is what you need, baby, check my pedigree. Come and take me on a shopping spree... you, you, you, you.)

(4x)
Hoes and tramps
Fucks and sluts
Bitches, scams
Tits and butts

Bitches be screamin' for this eight inch demon
And when you hear me screamin'
I'm about to free the semen
Wipe myself on your couch cover
If she talks any trash I flash my box cutter
'Cause I'm rougher
Than any pimp you've had in your life hoe
I talk soft, walk tall, carry a rifle
Kill that bullshit
'Cause if baby gets spiteful
I'm lacing the liquor
With some piss and some Lysol
Roll in a shit brown Lincoln
Eatin' a sticky bun
Spot check the block
Pick one that's gonna gimme some
'Cause I'm a freak
I like the girls with tattoos
Yo, I once got busy in a Burger King drive through
I take 'em two at a time
Make 'em both say my name
Ain't never had three
But best believe that I'm game
And that's the key: game
Girl I fit words like Scrabble
The inner city cowboy
With the thick herds of cattle
Crusin' Lake street
Gene Pool ridin' shotgun
Got the flyest trickies
From the Mississippi to Boston
I got a house full of porn
To keep the vibe warm
The door's always open honey
Come outta the storm
Yo, I got daddy's little girls
Ones that always stay true
Got an Uptown girl
She dyes the pubic hair blue
And I gotta bitch that lives in Kenwood
Rich townhouse flavor
She travels on business
I'm gettin' down with the neighbors
I gotta freak drives the bus
Shows me love with the free rides
A hundred hoes in St. Paul
But only one from east side
Gotta a Bloomington bitch
With a pool at her apartment
Rug burns all over
From fuckin' her on the carpet
Got the mega mall hoes
Make 'em all work the food court
Hit me off with a chicken soft taco
And a couple of Newports
Stripper bitches
Bodies, jewels and fake tities
And a hoe that lives in Fargo
For when I escape the city

But my favorite one
Out of all of 'em is your girl
I sway the tongue
Never once have I been forceful
She lays it on
Like it's a job that she loves
Yo who's lips are these?
The response is always: Slug's.

The Richfield bitches
Freak the lip-gloss and hairspray
Downtown women
That like to fuck on the staircase
Northside chicks
Southside chicks
Suburban chicks
Love to open married women
Up to the pervertedness
Disturbin' your relationship
Excuse my morals
I work it with the way I trick 'em out
Silly mortals
The words I kick
The sport I play
Know what to say
When I'm sittin' at this buffet
With all these tasty morsels

But my favorite one
Out of all of 'em is your girl
I sway the tongue
Never once have I been forceful
She lays it on
Like it's a job that she loves
Yo who's lips is these?
The response is always: Slug's.

Crusin' down the street
In my baby's mom's Caprice
February got the windows cracked
Wearin' a fleece
Hit the bus depot
Yo boo, you kinda cute
Give me nine and a half weeks
I'll have that freak sniffin' too
Distributin' cum
Across the rotten fruited plain
I know it's hard bein' young girl
Let me soothe the pain
I understand you baby
Straight up I understand
Now lift up your ass
So I can pull these fuckin' pants down
Now the ones I don't do
Are those under eighteen
Or at least I keep that shit a secret
If you know what I mean
I got sluts that love to give head
And I like to watch
The way they move their tongue
Up and down my-

"Mother fucker! I can't believe you're sittin' down here recording some bullshit like this!"

"It's just a song man, it's just a song, it's like a joke man shit. Nah, it's just a joke man."

"Oh, you wanna be a pimp, huh? Well you better pimp your way over to that neglected girl you got there."

"Goddamn man, why you always trippin' on me in front of my friends man?"

"Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talking about. Mother fucker, you got a kid. How you gonna be rhymin' about some bullshit like this shit, man."

But my favorite one
Out of all of 'em is your girl
I sway the tongue
Never once have I been forceful
She lays it on
Like it's a job that she loves
Yo who's lips is these?
The response is always: Slug's.

"Aight, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight, damn. Yo Ant, I gotta go man. I'll be back next Sunday. Yo, yo, no, gimme the keys man, I'll drive. Gimme the fuckin', no, fine you drive, fine."

Black pantyhose, pink lace
Showin' through the holes, fishnets
Black pantyhose, pink lace
Showin' though the hole...

(Drop my drawers and the bitch said, "Shit!" Skinny mother fucker with a fat ass dick.)
