(Go!) Shadow of evil, over my eyes
(I know) My sight is twisted
(I know it all!) I don't care!
(Go!) Hand of evil, cover my ears
(I know) My sense is twisted
(I know it all!) I don't care

My mind and thought turn to nothing (Go!)
This shadow of fear is growing
Right now (Empty eyes)
Is this what you really are trying to do

(Go!) Right now far away from here look at this world
It's only fear (But I know!)
Right now far away from here look at this world
(It's only fear)

(Go!) Shadow of evil, over my eyes
(I know) My sight is twisted
(I know it all!) I don't care!
(Go!) Hand of evil, cover my ears
(I know) My sense is twisted
(I know it all!) I don't care

My mind and thought turn to nothing (Go!)
This shadow of fear is growing
Right now (Empty eyes)
Is this what you really are trying to do

(Go!) Right now far away from here look at this world
It's only fear (But I know!)
Right now far away from here look at this world
(It's only fear)

(Go!) Acting like they know it all (They don't know)
When you die alone in the black sky (Go! Go! Go! Go!)
You don't wanna hear anything (when you die)
They don't know this world oppressed
One always getting scared

(Whoa) Oppressed one always getting scared! (x4)
