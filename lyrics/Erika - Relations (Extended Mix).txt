Relations, are what we are living for.
Relations, they are not always for long.
Relations, among the stars in the sky.
Relations, sometimes they end; you cry.

She loves her dog, he loves cats
They are friends.

Relations, for business or just for fun.
Relations, sometimes only for one night.

Relations, sometimes they end; you cry.

They end; you cry!
