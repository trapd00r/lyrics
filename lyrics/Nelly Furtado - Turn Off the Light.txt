It's gettin' so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds 
Or say wou is me instead
There's an achin' inside my head
It's tellin' me I'm better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see 
If you will get some

They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
Cuz I think I am good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see 
Yeah, if you're gonna get some

They say that girl you know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you, don't you, don't you, come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna belive
I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm lookin' to find
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see 
It's all in me, yeah

Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
Till' you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
Till' you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

All in me, yeah
Where is your logic 
Who do you need
Where can you turn in your delicate time of need
Follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
I do not need I do not need nobody
Follow me down, follow me down, down, down
I do not need I do not need nobody
Follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
See all my dreams, see all my dreams
Follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
See all my dreams, see all my dreams

Where is your logic
Who do you need
Where can turn
