New York poor New York 
New York poor New York 

cars choking your child to death 
but you don't wanna see 
cause you only think about yourself 
how blind can you be 

New York poor New York 
sniper on the rooftop New York 
New York poor New York 
not fit for a dog in New York 

everybody bites on the Big Apple 
leave the hungry in tears 
but no one gives a damn no one really cares 
how they feel they're just paper people not real 

you need a gun to walk into New York 

now you're broke and you're out on a ledge 
who can help you this time 
now you're down to your very last cent 
still you're askin' me who was your friend 
i was your friend 

New York poor New York 
who turned the lights out in New York 

New York poor New York 
just another blackout in New York 

girl dead on the 26th floor 
but no one knew her name 
found her body behind the door 
too young for the game 

New York poor New York 
devils in the subway New York 
New York poor New York 
New York poor New York 
talkin talkin talkin - watch out 
Harlem touching midtown New York 
New York poor New York 

talkin 'bout New York New York 
money's getting tighter New York 
they're burning the bridges to New York
