(Everlast)
Once upon a time not long ago,
when people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood,
and people were behavin' like they our too good
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy
and this is what he said
"Me and you, Guy, we gonna make sum cash,
robbin' old folks and makin' the dash"
They did the job, money came with ease,
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover,
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic,
He said, "keep still, boy, no need for static",
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped,
the kid pulled out a gun
He said, "Why'd you hit me?",
the barrel headed straight for the cop kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure,
"I'll do years if I pull this trigger"
So he cold dashed, ran around the block,
cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister,
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations,
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming so he made a left,
he was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him,
then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor,
opened up the door there, guess who he saw
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope,
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap,
He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run",
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over,
then he dipped into a car, was a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university,
Escaped alive though the car was battered,
rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets but still had static,
grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, "back off or honey here's dead",
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on,
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded,
he dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I gotta end this story,
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream,
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path,
straight and narrow or your soul gets cashed
G'night
