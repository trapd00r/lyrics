"You go bustin' your fist against a stone wall
You're not usin' your brain
That's what the white man wants you to do
Look at you, what makes you ashamed of bein' black?"

Nuttin' but love for you my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that? No doubt
Shit, in this white man'z world

Sometimes we overlook the fact that we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin' in this white man'z world
In this white man's world, I ain't sayin' I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin' in this white man'z world, this song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up or we messed up

Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison, I miss ya
Cryin', lookin' at my niece's and my nephew's picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspicious
Swearin' one day you might leave me for somebody that's richer

Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive, they mail, best believe, we riot

Eatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at walls of silence
Inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologizes to my TRUE sisters, far from bitches

Help me raise my black nation reparations are due, it's true
Caught up in this world, I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man'z world and all I heard was

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

Bein' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, dyed in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket gently askin', is there Heaven for G's?

My homeboy's doin' life, his baby momma be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son, finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama why we live so poor?
Why you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door

Now do you love me mama? Whitey keep on callin' me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop

Proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
Don't look around busta, you sucka, check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man'z world

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

So tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
In the blink of an eye, my time away just made perfection
Did you think I'd die? Not gon' cry, why should I care
Like we holdin' on to lost love that's no longer there

Can you please help me, God, bless me
Please, keep my seeds healthy
Makin', all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin', they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven, ain't no G's in Hell

Sister sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal

Every women in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times in this white man's world

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

The seal and the constitution
Reflect the thinking of the founding fathers
That this was to be a nation by white people and for white people
Native Americans, blacks and all other non-white people
Were to be the burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation
