I was stuck in minor chords.
I've been here once before
with environmental echoes
by your baggage on my floor.
So get over here,
let's grab ourselves another beer,
to drink until tomorrow
to forget that we're still alive.

Drinking to forget
always breeds regret
and disillusioned faces upon
friends that we've seldom met.
I do believe that my
self-constructed alibi
is cracking under pressure
whilst I'm breaking on the inside.

Sick of making sure,
I'm sick of sitting with my hands trapped, falling on my back and
telling people I know
more than they needed to know.
And this song is more
than a self-indulgent rant, it's closure for the times that
I've let you down.
You know I need you around.

Well, I'm still here,
long overdue,
but it feels like you're in a life of pastures new.

So this one's for the friends,
and also for the sound
of distant laughter, acting as
reminders. In a town
that made us feel at home,
we broke our backs on floors of stone,
but I'd rather wake there any day,
than wake up here alone.

Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
Baa, ba ba ba ba
