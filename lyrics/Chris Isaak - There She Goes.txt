There she goes
There she goes

All dressed up and walking
You found somebody new
I don't want nobody
I was happy with you

There she goes

I never said I love you
But you know that I do
I can't believe I'ts over
I keep thinking of you

I see her everywhere
Everywhere I go
I see her everywhere
Everywhere I go

There she goes
There she goes

There she goes

Don't know why she left me
Don't know what I'll do
I don't want no counsel
I was happy with you
I see her everywhere
Everywhere I go
I see her everywhere
Everywhere I go

There she goes
There she goes
There she goes

I wanna cry over you
There she goes
There she goes

There she goes
There she goes
