(One... and two)
Ooh
(Baby)
Dear baby, I'm not sorry
For leaving you this way
But I know I should have
Told you face to face
We've always been straight up,
So I won't waste your time
I'm leaving, say goodbye
Because I know what
You did last night

Let me let you know, yeah,
That I'm leaving, baby
Let me let you know, yeah,
That I'm leaving, baby
Let me let you know
I don't know where I'm going,
But I'm going far from here
Let me let you know, yeah,
That I'm leaving, baby
Yeah, oh yeah

One more thing before I go
I hope you feel alone
'Cause I'm definitely tired of
Waiting for you to come home
(Been waiting for you at home)
We've always been straight up,
So I'll just take what's mine
I'm leaving, say goodbye
Because you hurt me
For the last time

Chorus (repeat)

Whatever your excuse is
I'm sure I've heard
Them all before
Time and time again
I told you that I needed more
Now I'm walking out the door

Chorus (repeat)
