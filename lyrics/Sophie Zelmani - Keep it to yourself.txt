You keep it to yourself
You keep it to yourself
It's your treasure
But you're not thinking of my health

Like this morning, were you dreaming?
Was it a night in hell?
It's your burden
But I'm not feeling well

You are gone with your feelings
Are you taking care?
If you're good at what you're doing
It's good that I am here

You just disappear
You just disappear
It's your talent
But I only get scared

You are gone with your feelings
Are you taking care?
If you're good at what you're doing
It's good that I am here
