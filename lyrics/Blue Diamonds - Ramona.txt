Ramona, I hear the mission bells above,
Ramona, they ringing out a song of love.

I press you caress you,
And bless the day you taught me to care.
To always remember,
The ramblin rose you wear in your hair.

Ramona, when day is done you hear my call,
Ramona, we'll meet beside the waterfall.

I'll dread the dawn,
When I awake to find you gone.
Ramona,
I need you, my own.
