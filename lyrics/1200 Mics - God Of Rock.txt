Energy caught, outside of time, so over controlled, 
I am loosing my mind.
What is required, what must I do, are you for real. 
Can you take me with you.

(What must I do x8)

This is the force of life, 7300 kilo-calories per mole. pure unadulterated energy
What are you doing right now?
taking notes? ugh crossing your legs? coughing? digesting your food? listening to your voice mail? when the professor is lecturing, every aspect of the human body. 
EVERY SINGLE THING IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE!

(What must I do x8)

God of Rock, thank you for this chance to kick ass. We are your humble servants. Please give us the power to blow people's minds with our high voltage rock. In your name we pray, Amen. 
(Amen)
NOW LETS GET OUT THERE AND MELT SOME FACES!
