Memories we share together
Moments no one else can know
I will keep them close to me
Never let them go

Once you filled my hands with roses
Then you  gave your heart to me
When a kiss had followed this
Love was meant to be

Time goes by
And the snow is drifting
Slowly in the sky
Cold, cold night

As you lie beside me
I can hear your heartbeat

You have lost yourself in dreaming
I have lost myself in you
Now we lie beneath the sky
Stars and midnight blue
