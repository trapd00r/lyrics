Freestyle 1:
 Somebody hold me back
 Im unstoppable
 I got more guns than a mothafuckin arsenal
 
 Somebody hold my crack
 While I fix my plaque
 For not bein black
 N makin rap
 Well anyways
 I really gotta take a crap
 N maybe get a snack
 But u know ill be back
 To write another track
 Another verbal attack
 
 Freestyle 2:
 Yo I get up in the morning and im tired as hell
 stretch out on my bed its already 12
 get a bite to eat nothing too sweet or I be bouncing up and down all over the street
 I put on my stuff and my bling bling and I rap man I dont sing doin my own thing
 like nobody else in the rap game I built myself a rap name and I share in the rap fame
 with all the others who claimed rap as a second language like a home to go to when theyre feelin alone or bored too
 and sometimes feelin caught in a cartoon its like a fantasy world with cars, cash, n money, 
 but it aint even funny 
 how real it is and u hav no idea how I feel in it 
 I feel so real in it 
 my pains from my childhood this is really healin it
 I used to be concealin it 
 everything is so clear now 
 theres nothing I gotta fear now 
 I made my self a career now 
 it aint the same no more 
 everyday I walk in the door 
 and feel like a different man than I was b4 
 things hav changed but im still the same, 
 inside me ill never rearrange my brains i still fuck like a mofo, 
 ballin like a real pro, 
 mad hops like uve never seen befo gimme the ball and watch the show 
 got range like a black man speed like a track man agility too, ull never see me slack man, 
 I make every ball in the rack man, if u thinking of shootin, ill eat u up like pacman
 
 Freestyle 3:
 Everyonce in a while I make yo bitch smile 
 Cuz I rap so good I can make yo bitch wild 
 cuz the chicks dig it and they gotta love the style of the illest rapper from here to the nile.

 I hope u know yo honey likes to please me I rap till im wheezy 
 even when im sneezing u just gotta 
 get me the keyzeez to drive me here and all the clothes to cover up thee rear 
 u just gotta get me the food when I want it and when I got the urge u gotta get me the Chronic 
 better be on it 
 as fast as Sonic..

 of the sport 
 even all over the court 
 and no I dont mean with the law 
 I mean bas-ket-ball dogg dont fuck wit me or ill hav to put u in ur cas-ket 
 n all thats not all though 
 ill come to ur funeral and shoot over and over like Ronaldo

 Yo ill never stop spittin the rhymes that Ive written over the years publicity like monica and Clinton 
 winnin Grammies come wit tears and they dont come easy and if they do damn that shits measly yeah
 
 Freestyle 4: (FatMan)
 I mean this guy can cause an earthquake
 His favorite part of the day is his snack break
 Damn just bake him a cupcake and make him a cookie
 He sits around all day and daydreams about nookie
 More cusion for the pushin right?
 well ok, but only if you ever get to pushing, aight?
 At the gym I can find your ass up on the Stairmaster
 But youre on level two shit go a lil faster
 Look man Im not going to lie 
 ill tell u how I feel
 They should handcuff your big ass to the treadmill
 Its dont take a genius to figure out you were fed well
 If u go on a diet maybe u can shed a lil
 I see u at the store u buy out the whole aisle
 It take you 20 minutes just to run a whole mile
 
 Freestyle 5: Shaq (diss)
 #34 LA Lakers Man fuck shaq
 Most Valuable Player? Man fuck that
 Shaqs just a black man wit a 6 pack
 He only good cuz he can grab a wall n tear a brick back
 Is he number one? man hell no hova
 He wouldnt be even if hell froze ova
 Kobe rocks that joint up in tinsel town
 When u need an answer he can make the shit go down
 But shaqs got
 No shot and they all think that hes so hot (hes so not)
 Always the same thing hes like a robot 
 Just get it into Shaquille so he can dunk it for 2 points
 By the time he gets out of the key youd have smoked up two joints 
 He weighs so much (oh! can some-bo-dy hear two oinks)
 He ate so many crunches that now his belly boinks
 Theres a reason the Magic traded away the Shaq pack
 They were getting angry they wanted the sun back
 And for when they went to games
 They wanted the fun back
 And they hope that Shaq never brings his nasty buns back
 Because nobody likes him
 Im sorry, your done Shaq
 I hope u understand no pun to be intended
 I hope ur mama sees the son that shes invented
 Im sorry Mrs O neal
 I understand how you must feel
 This nightmare is so real
 But chill, maybe hell get killed
