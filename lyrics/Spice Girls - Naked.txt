Naivety and childhood left behind
Deprived of the goodness of mankind
Past encounters have made her strong
Strong enough to carry on and on

Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down, no need to care
Lights are low, exposed and bare

(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked)

She knows exactly what to do with men like you
Inside out in her mind there's no doubt where you're coming from
Mystery will turn you on

Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down, no need to care
Lights are low, exposed and bare

(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked)

Hello? It's me. I thought you'd understand. Well, maybe I should have kept my mouth shut. I keep seeing such a pretty picture. I'd rather be hated than pitied. Maybe I should have left it to your imagination. I just want to be me.

This angel's dirty face is sore
Holding onto what she had before
Not sharing secrets with any old fool
Now she's gonna keep her cool
She wants to get naked
She wants to get naked

(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
(Naked) Nothing but a smile upon her face
(Naked) She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
(Naked) This child has fallen from grace
(Naked) Don't be afraid to stare, she is only naked
