You played more than a feature
Back then when I was, pleased to meet you
You were on my team
You were a bobber and a weever
You're just a pagan now, non believer

You're all about yourself
No one else
And who the fuck are you though?
I should never ever ever let you get too close
If the truth be told
I can't wait to see you go
Can't wait to see you break, break, break, break
Breaking your back
'Cause all you do is take, take, take, take, take
Never give back

Big deal, I'm blessed
Keep talking I'm unimpressed
You're way too out of your depths
My time will not be invested
You've changed
You used to be my friend
But I don't know you no
Went too far can't undo
The things you've done, they put me through hell

You only care about yourself
No one else
And who the fuck are you though?
I should never ever ever let you get too close
If the truth be told
I can't wait to see you go
Can't wait to see you break, break, break, break
Breaking your back
'Cause all you do is take, take, take, take, take
Never give back

Yo, look pon your face
You dirty stinking waste
Member dem times when you deh pon my case
Straight chase, me carry pepper-spray mace
You're done for now you better tie your shoelace
Waste
You comin' last in di race
You're no one my lord, you don't even have the ace
Nah, mate
It's just all too late
Back up, back up, nah bodda come my way
When you check it was all so phoney
Nuf gal yah have ya really tink seh mi lonely?
Whole heap a man I call my homie
Me give dem di wok and keep them moanin'


And who the fuck are you though?
I should never ever ever let you get too close
If the truth be told
I can't wait to see you go
Can't wait to see you break, break, break, break
Breaking your back
'Cause all you do is take, take, take, take, take
Never give back
Can't wait to see you break, break, break, break
Breaking your back
'Cause all you do is take, take, take, take, take
Never give back
