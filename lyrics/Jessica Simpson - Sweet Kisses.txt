Couldn't look me in the eye
He apologizes
He didn't make enough to
Take me out tonight
I beg him not to worry
Please don't turn away
I don't need a world of riches
I just need a little time with you
And

Sweet kisses
All I really need is
Sweet kisses
That's what moves me

His lips are pure emotion
He smiles because he knows
How much I love the way he
Makes me feel inside
He answers all my wishes
Who could ask for more
Doesn't have to say I love you
All I need, he tells me with his

Sweet kisses
All I really need is
Sweet kisses
That's what moves me

He heels me
He touches me down to my soul
My hearts beating out of control
I just need a little time with you

Sweet kisses
All I really need is
Sweet kisses
That's moves me

Sweet kisses baby
That's all I really need from you
Don't need your money baby
Just want your touch now baby
'Cause that's what moves me honey
Sweet kisses
