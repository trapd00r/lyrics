(Eminem: Intro)
Whoo!
Remix!
Lloyd Banks!
Ha ha!

(Eminem: Verse 1)
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It's like a joke - he's like a king but he don't rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold, or want the jewellery
He don't want the ring, don't want the loot - he's in it for the sport
Runnin' circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin' for it
And you can love it, you can hate it, but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ignorant, but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin' then you better come confront me for it

(Nate Dogg: Chorus)
This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't nothing to be makin' niggas paranoid
Hit your corner wit' my weapon - I don't need my boys
I'm doin' a hundred an' twenty in the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers - gotta maintain
Money, power, and respect in this rap game

(Lloyd Banks: Verse 2)
He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggas hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomachs ache while he's loungin' in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a nigga skate
Houses with a bigger gate. Houndin' hims a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break
'Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz till where you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest players that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G-Unit Records - ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them

(Nate Dogg: Chorus)
This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it

It ain't nothing to be makin' niggas paranoid
Hit your corner wit' my weapon - I don't need my boys
I'm doin' a hundred an' twenty in the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers - gotta maintain
Money, power, and respect in this rap game

(50 Cent: Verse 3)
He's no magician - man, the kid makes somethin' out of nothin'
So now niggas from his 'hood act like he owe 'em somethin'
They talk crazy till he send niggas to where to buck 'em
Ask him if it's a problem and he'll say, "Nah, it's nothin'"
He was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted - fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel, they can hate him or love him
He hold his own; on his own the kid is really thuggin'
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggas think he buggin'
He bulletproof everything case niggas try an' buck him
Keep two pistols on his hip, I show you where he tuck 'em
Niggas say they gon' get at him, but they can't touch him
Try to catch him slippin', they creepin' - he start bustin'

(Nate Dogg: Chorus)

(Nate Dogg: Outro)
I can give you niggas somethin' you can talk about
I can turn your smile upside-down
You ain't no G - you a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl and turn her out
Don't hold it in - let it all out
I can give you fuckers something to be mad about
Invite her in - send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth
