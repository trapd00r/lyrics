Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh

Check it out, going out on the late night
Looking tight, feeling nice, it's a cock fight
I can tell I just know that it's going down tonight
At the door we don't wait cause we know them
At the bar, six shots, just beginning
That's when dickhead put his hands on me
But you see

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh

Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance by myself, guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
Buh-bye
Listen up, it's just not happening
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight
Alright?

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
Break, break, break, break break it down

In the corner with your boys you bet up five bucks
To get at the girl that just walked in but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me yeah

You know you are high fivin', talkin' shit, but you're going home alone aren't cha?

'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment
No
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over
Know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
It's just you and your hand

I'm not here for your entertainment
No no no
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
Just take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
Yeah oh
