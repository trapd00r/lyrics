I've been the girl, with her skirt pulled high
Been the outcast, never running with mascara eyes
Now I see the world as a candy store
With a cigarette smile
Sayin' things you can't ignore
Like mommy I love you
Daddy I hate you
Brother, I need you
Lover, hey fuck you
I can see everything here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

[Chorus:]
If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
You are the music
If God is a DJ
Life is a dancefloor
You get what your given
It's all how you use it

I've been the girl, middle finger in the air
Unaffected by rumors, the truth
I don't care
So open your mouth and stick out your tongue
You might as well let go you can't take back what you've done
So find a new lifestyle
A reason to smile
Look for Nirvana
Under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex dreams
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You take what you get and you get what you give
I said don't run from yourself man that's no way to live
I got a record in my bag you should give it a spin
Lift your hands in the air so that life can begin

If God is a DJ....
Say if God is a DJ....
If God....
If God is a DJ, then life is a dance floor, get your ass on the dance floor....

[Chorus 2x]
