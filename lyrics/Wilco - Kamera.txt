I need a camera to my eye
To my eye reminding
Which lies that I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I've counted out
Days to see how far
I've driven in the dark
With echoes in my heart
Phone my family, tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk
No, it's not okay

I smashed a camera, I wanna know why
To my eye deciding
Which lies that I been hiding
Which echoes belong

I'm counting on
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
Memories distort
Phone my family, tell them I'm lost on the sidewalk
No, it's not okay

I'm counted out
And no one knows how far (tell them I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark (tell them I'm lost)
With echoes in my heart (tell them I'm lost)
Phone my family tell them I'm lost, yeah, I'm lost
And no, it's not okay
No, it's not okay
No, it's not okay
