I believe we all have one true love
Somewhere in this world I do (I do, I do, I do)
When it seemed all my dreams were falling through 
That's when I found you

I believe for every heart
that whispers in the dark
there's a ray of light somewhere shining through
it was sink or swim
when the tide came in
I found myself

Chorus:
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes I knew, I found the deepest love I knew
Oooo-oh-oh, oh I believe yes it's true 
I found myself
When I found you

I believe, for every door, that's closing
For every heartbreak there's hope for something new
From the ashes rised, a glimpse of paradise
it's a glimer in your eyes 

When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes I knew, I found the deepest love I knew
Oooo-oh-oh, oh I believe, yes it's true
I found myself

When I found you
A life I thought no one knows
I thought love was just the tingling of the skin
I felt so alone, all alone
More than you could ever know
You showed deep love, sweet love

When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
I found the deepest love I knew
I found the closest thing to heaven
I found myself
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes I knew
I found the deepest love I knew
Oooo-oh-oh, oh I belive, yes it's true
I found myself
When I found...
You
