Spell Check

[verse 1]

Don't call me sugar, baby, sweetie or honey (ew)
Don’t call me girly, bitch you tryna be funny
See I don't like being patronized or made to feel diminutive
So call me by my name, or justice will be punitive

That's cool, what's your name you may ask?
Should i use your stage name or your name from the past
Well that depends, see I've been Alex, Lalex, even Alebeska
But ask if I have a preference, lll answer ‘you betcha’

Everybody please call me Lex, the Lexicon artist
I'm the nerdy rapper with the words that are the hardest
It started with just Lex but I added some more
So i could shove my stupid foot into this Google search engine door

But even Lex? You still manage to fuck it up
I wrote a whole song about it, was that not enough?
Obviously we need to do it again
But this time it's a singalong you can do with your friends, YEAH

[Chorus]

I'll make it easy you don't need to spell check
It's L to the E to the mf X
Yessss

[verse 2]

A Lex, by any other name, would be just as sick
But if you call me Lexi you can eat a dick
Call me Lexi one more time and then you’ll see
I’ll write you off harder than expenses in a Schedule C

Nowhere in Alex is an ‘i’ except in Liu
But understanding that might be too much to expect of you
So I’ll break it down, I’m partial to Lex for its gender neutral use
But Lexi’s way too feminine and even worse, cute

Yes I use my government name on my facebook
But if you call me Alex I will give you a strange look (huh)
I'm not offended I just find it kinda weird
When a rando addresses me as if we've been friends for years

Listen, my name is Alex, that’s Lex for short
Not Alexandra, not Alexis, I’m a Lex in court
So in short, please refrain from asking me what Alex stands for
That’s my real name, you can read it on my passport

[Chorus]

I'll make it easy you don't need to spell check
It's L to the E to the mf X
Yesss

[verse 3]

A lot of rappers wrote songs about their alias
Like Sammus, Schaffer the Darklord, also the man whose Slim is the Shadiest
But, I bet your ass that they’ve never been asked
“Hey what’s your real name.” “Alex?” “No no, I mean before that.”

Listen idiot, my English name is not fake
I’m a citizen, but thank you for your hot take
See I’ve got two names, one of them is in Mandarin
But you can’t even say it, why bother with your shenanigans?

Okay fine, my Chinese name is 劉庭安
And it means “peace in the family” I don’t know if I am
Maybe I am, but when I’m Lex, I know I’m the man
And if you think that’s not the real me, I don’t give a damn

So call me Lex for the fans, and Alex for the fam
Come with me we’ll take it back to where it all began
See, whatever name they try to sell me next
I’ll ask you why you fuckin’ with the L.E.X
Yes

[Chorus]

I'll make it easy you don't need to spell check
It's L to the E to the mf X
Yesss
