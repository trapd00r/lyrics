five, four, three, two, one..!

At the end of every week.
Each one of us become to freak.
Tonight the dj makes his move.
And make the sweat drops from. the roof
It's time to left your face guitar.
To all we know stand all apart.
Just take me with you in a dream.
Let's sing the song and come with me.

Turn it up.......

Just take me with you in a dream.
Let's sing the song and come with me

This big consistance makes me sound
Tonight the dance and spinning round
All the people on the floor
They shake their bodies cry for more
Never let this feeling go
And make the music in control
Forget your troubles and feel free
And jump this move and come with me

Turn it on..
