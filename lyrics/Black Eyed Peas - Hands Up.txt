You dumbin' it down we smartened it up
We penetrate even though your guard was up
Get down to the peas 'cause we fallin' up
Electric 'cause we like charging up

Rhythmic sonic pleaser
Getcha hot like fever
Boiling one hundred degrees uh

Heats getting low let me turn it up
Let me fuck-up your ear till my sperm is up
In your brain and the baby Will I Am's be saying

Stormin' strong for my several
Baracade laid for you terribles
Ho, I'm the chief phillip we know
Letting you know we about to blow

Time for us to raise it up
Never going down always headin' up
Raise your hands 'cause we blaze it up
Anybody here who waited long
To you I dedicate this song
Ain't nothing wrong gotta make it right
Straight to the point this is the new joint
And you know this is the jam y'all
