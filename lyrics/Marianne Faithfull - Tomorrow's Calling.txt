Tomorrow's calling with promises new
I hear the echo of yesterday's blue.

Silver patterns of porcelain rose
Cobwebs of filley green.
Where I get them from nobody knows,
No one but you can see.

All the treasures of time will be there,
Take them away, they're free.
The finest thing is a love that we'll share
If you will follow me.

If I were foolish I'd promise the sky.
But I must not let my hopes run too high.

And I wonder when all's said and done
What will the future be?
All I know is that you are the one
If you will follow me.

If you will follow me.
If you will follow me.

And I wonder when all is said and done
What will the future be?
All I know is that you are the one
If you will follow me,
If you will follow me,
If you will follow me.

Tomorrow's calling with promises new
I hear the echo of yesterday's blue.

I hear the echo of yesterday's blue.
I hear the echo of yesterday's blue.
