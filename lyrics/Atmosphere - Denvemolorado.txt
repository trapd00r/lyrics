Good evening ladies and gentlemen I want you to give a warm welcome for
Anybody here ever been to Colorado, more importantly Denver

Nothing I say
Nothing I say meant a thing to you

Here I am alone in an airport bar
Why? I guess 'cause I don't own a car
It's Valentines Day I'm returning home from Berkley
Ain't a damn thing none a y'all can do to hurt me

Unsober laid-over in Denver
The waitress could smell it the minute I entered
The set the shells amusing the soul in here
Sporadically placed amongst scotch and beer

But there's one woman in the back left corner
Who looks like she could really use a supporter
If only I could muster the strength to be a friend
Who knows how this adventure could end?

Bend me up, slip me the tongue, shoot me down
Cut me loose, bury me and piss on the ground
I can't help but wonder what's over yonder
Don't know if I can get down for too much longer

Everywhere I go I find at least one
And I bet it won't die till the travel is done
For as long as I roam my heart holds a gun
Up to the side of my head, ride or die for the young

Nothing I say
Nothing I say meant a thing to you

It's the sound of emotion enough to make me wanna
Hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed
But when I stop to climb the ladder that's embedded in my heart
I start to question all the emotion in my head

The sound of emotion enough to make me wanna
Hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed
But when I stop to climb the ladder that's embedded in my heart
I start to question all the emotion in my head

The sound of emotion enough to make me wanna
Hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed
But when I stop to climb the ladder that's embedded in my heart
I start to question all the emotion in my head

The sound of emotion enough to make me wanna
Hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed
But when I stop to climb the ladder that's embedded in my heart
I start to question all the emotion in my head

The sound of emotion enough to make me wanna
Hang myself from the rafter that's over my bed

Nothing I say
Nothing I say meant a thing to you
