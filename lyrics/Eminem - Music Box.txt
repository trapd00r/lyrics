Yo
Yeah girl
Can you hear that
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy
Take a nap
You're not afraid, of the dark, are ya

You hear the beat
As it makes ya
Not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door
It's locked so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars
Not 'cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry
She smells like taco's
I want to eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows
Also sweet
With sugar plums
Oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em
He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey
A holiday ham
See 'em sprinkled on toast
With strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers
With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper
Is all that I am
My music box

When the lights are off
I see the girl's asleep
But I'm waiting my love
Keep calling me
We're worlds apart
But you mean the world to me

I almost look comatose
Who wants to be sober? gross
I foam like a doberman
Mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils
In both my holes then i plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size
My eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up
Get naked and run around
Waving the gun around
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder
How come it rains but the sun is out?
The Devil's upset with his wife
They must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out
What the fuck I'm 'bout?
Voices are leading me up to the attic
I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse
The sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest
But what do I do it's locked?
I pick it and open it
But it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'till I find it, I wind it up
And the tune it starts
It's playing a song
So beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full
I smell a funeral guess I'll loom in the park
My music box

When the lights are off
I see the girl's asleep
But I'm waiting my love
Keep calling me
We're worlds apart
But you mean the world to me

I'm fixated
On asphyxiating
And breakin' this little chick's neck
Like a pixie stick
The sick, satan worshippin'
Bitches get horse whippin'
I'm in the back
Through the back
Door slippin'
Through the crack
Leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love
Sent from above
Forced and treat 'em all
When she no more stingy I've become
Been doing this for more than a quarter century
I'm just numb
Am I dreamin'? is it real?
Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come
To tie her up
Dada roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window look at her
The crime is slow to shatter
Her brain matter and batter her
With a bat a matter of fact
That will splatter her
But before i do that
I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back
Like Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer
I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight
But you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight
As I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs
Simple as that cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens
Then pan back the camera
Stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack
So Pamela
