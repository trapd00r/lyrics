Yo, I can't sing good
I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy

Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out


Some days I sit (sit), starin' out the window(dow)
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think (think) there's nothin' to live for (for)
I almost break down and cry

Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no)

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl (girl) (Hailie laughs) keeps gettin' older (der)
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes (jokes), 'cuz they don't understand me (me)
They just don't see my real side

I act like shit don't phaze me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive

But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no)

[Chorus]

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom did adum

Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul

And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'

Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself

But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted

So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?

Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya

Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted

And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Woo!
I told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said

If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you (kiss)
