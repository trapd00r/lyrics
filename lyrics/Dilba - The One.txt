Stubborn 18
thinks he knows everything
never takes an advice
he is not listening
She's out in the blue
so much dreaming to do
young and rebel defines
what she wants out of life

Baby, you should have been
the arms to run and hide in
the one in my life
I thought I could trust, but

(Ref.)
Every little thing in my life
Everything I felt so right
I never knew that i would re-write
the time of my life, to not knowing better
Anything that I can think of
Everything that it was made of
I never knew that I would rewind
I'm not going back
never again, no

Wiser 30
takes it slow and slowly
appreciates little things
is no longer running
When I look at you
and you're looking at me
In my airborn wings
thinking it was worth it

baby, you should have been
the arms to run and hide in
the one in my life
I thought I could trust, but

Ref.

If life is a test
and love's for the best
Who doesn't deserve happiness
Well you gives no clue
searching blindly, and the truth, 
Is that we never stood a chance...
