I think that I'm gonna miss the struggle if it all pans out
I guess I've always had a thing for trouble since I learned how to mess around
Yeah I feel so split like I want to give the other me another name
When I get in the fix I won't never rat 'cause I know that we're both the same

I can never grow up but I don't feel stuck
I would never even think to blame this all on luck

It might sound like I'm down but I think that I'm trying to be positive
So go ahead and pour another round while I try to wrap my head around it
I think I'm saying just right now this might be the best we'll ever have
So won't you pour another cup and give me a smile like it ain't so bad

I'll never grow up but I don't feel stuck
I'd never even think to blame this all on luck
