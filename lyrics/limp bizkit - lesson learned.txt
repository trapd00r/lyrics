This pain in my stomach
Won't go away
I assume this is punishment
From all the mistakes I've made

In a world where my actions
Speak louder than words
In a world where my actions
Speak louder than words

I know more people
Than ever before
One lesson I've learned
From it all

Fortune and fame
Are disguised as your friend
'Cause I'm lonelier now
Than I've ever been

'Cause this pain in my stomach
Won't go away
I assume this is punishment
From all the mistakes I've made

In a world where my actions
Speak louder than words
In a world where my actions
Speak louder than words

I know more people
Than ever before
One lesson I've learned
From it all

Fortune and fame
Are disguised as your friend
'Cause I'm lonelier now
Than I've ever been
