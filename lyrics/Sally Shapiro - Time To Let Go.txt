Feeling of despair

After you have gone

I'm thinking and I wonder

What I should have done

I close my eyes

Even though I'm in love I'm cold as ice

I feel it's time to let go

You sent me a letter

Without no reply

I wish I would be better

But I'm too shy

You are so fine

And I'm thinking about you all the time

I want to rise up and shine like the sun

I want to say, "come to me 'cause I won't run"

I feel it's time to let go

You are so fine

And I'm thinking about you all the time

And I will rise up and shine like the sun

And I will say, "come to me 'cause I won't run"

I know it's time to let go
