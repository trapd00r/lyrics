When are you coming back for me?

Monday morning waking up
In an empty bed
Thought I'd feel you next to me,
But I'm alone instead

Did I scare you, when I said
I needed you?
Or was it just a one night stand
And nothing real to you?

When are you coming back for me?
'Cause no one else can be your girl
When are you coming back to see
It's a lonely world for me?

It's a lonely world for me

When are you coming back for me?
'Cause no one else can be your girl
When are you coming back to see
It's a lonely world for me?

It's a lonely world for me

Boy I think that you should know by now
That I want to be with you somehow

Saw you walking down the street
With somebody new
Why are you doing this to me?
What have I done to you?

Did I scare you when I said
I needed you?
Or was it just a one night stand
And nothing real to you?

When are you coming back for me?
'Cause no one else can be your girl
When are you coming back to see
It's a lonely world for me?

Boy I think that you should know by now
That I want to be with you somehow

When are you coming back for me?
'Cause no one else can be your girl
When are you coming back to see
It's a lonely world for me?

It's a lonely world for me

Hey Hey Hey Hey

When are you coming back for me?
