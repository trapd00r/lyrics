I interrupt your transmission
To distort your position
I is here, the avenger's back
Other MCs, their style is wack

They don't know the drill
Like my lyrical thrill
Still to be continued once again

Are you my foe or can I call you a friend?
Stepped up in the cipher all the way to the end

Knock on wood!

On the M. I. C. I start to flex
Badboy DJ, rough 'pon the dex
I is here, the avenger's back
Other MCs their style is wack

Creep 'pon the rhythm smooth like a spider
Nuff of them mine, some of them minor

To be continued once again
Stepped up in the cipher all the way to the end, yeah!

Knock on wood!

(It's like thunder, lightning!)

(It's like thunder, lightning!
The way you love me is frightening)

Yes! Knock on wood!
Knock on wood!
Aaaargh, wow!
