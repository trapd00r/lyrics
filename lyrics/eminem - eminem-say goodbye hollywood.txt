[Chorus: x8]
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood

[Chorus]

Hollywood
I Feel This Way 

I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs 

Which should of been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody could of seen this shit I felt
Knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell

To catch me the minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standing and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt

Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold 2 million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, tryna get my feet on solid ground

So for now 

[Chorus]

Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't want to look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would

And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I probaby should 'cause these problems are piled all at once
'Cause everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up

I gotta get up, thank god I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how to do it

All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps 
Of my dad 'cause I hate him so bad
Worst feeling I had was growing up to be like his fucking ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell em 

[Chorus]

I don't want to quit
This shit, it feels like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick

Publicity my ass, consume my fucking dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done ill never look at gats
If I scrap, I'ma scrap it like I never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact

That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamed I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask

What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
Its like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never would of rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, ill never get it back

I just want to leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from being no one and seein everything blow up
And all you did was grow up mceein'
Its fucking crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm saying 

[Chorus]

Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good

So, goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good
