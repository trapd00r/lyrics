No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart
Yeah
No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart

I wonder if I take you home,
Would you still be in love, baby?
In love, baby?

I wonder if I take you home,
Would you still be in love, baby?
In love, baby?

Girl, you know you got me, got me
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
You can't stop me once I started
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming baby, don't doubt it (Don't make me wait)
So let's be about it

No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart

Baby, have some trustin, trustin
When I come with lustin, lustin
'Cause I bring you that comfort
I ain't only here 'cause I want yer

Body, I want you're mind too
Interestin' what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on, girl, yee-haw!

Come on!

I wonder if I take you home,
Would you still be in love, baby?

No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart

Girl, you had me once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I'll play Bobby and you play Whitney (And I)

If you smoke I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love with you
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love I'm a crazy fool

No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart

Why you so insecure
When you got passion and love here
You always claim that I'm a cheata
Think I'll up and go leave ya

For another senorita
You forgot that I need ya
You must have caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe, uh

Well, yeah
Check it out

'Cause you know you got me by a string, baby
Don't you worry about it, baby

You know you make me feel so real...
