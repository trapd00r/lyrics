Looking down from  a plane
and I saw your  town
Sun was resting  yellow red
over your town
The cars were  driving around
One of those cars
could be yours

I was looking  down from a plane
and I saw your  town
Maybe you saw
Maybe you heard  my plane
Maybe you heard  the children play
and scream to the  airplanes that fly
Over our home
Came spring
But come summer I  wouldn’t know
I’m hoping I’m  jumping
in secret I go
High over our  home..

I was looking down from a plane and I saw I saw our town The road the houses the rivers and our playground Look up look here Maybe you’re looking when the children scream when I fly Over our home ...
