There's a house, that's not on a hill
And the paint's chipping off
Of the old window sill
There's a tree in the front yard
That's older than me
And older than all of you
There's a smell that the heat makes,
It reminds me of Christmas
And birthdays in December

I remember her
I remember her
I remember her so well
I remember her
I remember her
I remember her so well
But things they fade

She would kiss my hand
She would kiss my head
Then she'd fall asleep with me
In my tiny bed
She would sing me lullabies
Gave me my hazel eyes
And then she'd call me beautiful
She made me beautiful

I remember her
I remember her
I remember her so well
I remember her
I remember her
I remember her so well
But things they fade

Things turn to grey
As much as I try to save them
They turn grey
Just like the house, that's not on a hill
With all of the rust on the gate
The chips on the sill
But I love it still
