I heard Mama and Papa talkin' last night
And I heard Mama say to Papa: Let that boy rock and roll

The neighbor not complainin' and the schoolboy talked twice today
You know they think you're foolish, study or slippin' away
He don't think about nothin' 'cept the rock and roll records that play
I say it's all right, Pa, let the boy rock and roll
He's got a mind of his own and you know he's got a musical soul
And he's gotta play music and you know we really can't say no

So Daddy, don't you worry 'bout this crazy man
Go on and do what you think you should
But Daddy, don't you call him Little Boy Bad
When you know he could be Johnny B Good
I say it's all right, Pa, let the boy sing his song
In his brand new boots, he needs a foot from a kick in the town
If his music is groovy, you know he really can't go wrong

So Daddy, don't you worry 'bout this crazy man
Go on and do what you think you should
But please don't call him Little Boy Bad
When you know he could be Johnny B. Goode
I say it's all right, Pa, let the boy rock and roll
He's got a mind of his own and you know he's got a musical soul
If the music is groovy, you know we really can't say no
