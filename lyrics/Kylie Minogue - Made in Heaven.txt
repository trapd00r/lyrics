One kiss, one kiss
(Made in heaven)

So many questions needing answers
How will it be with me when it hits me
Can it happen in a second
Will it be just like a ringing bell

When it calls me
Is it just like music and lights
Or is that just a fairy tale
Will I see it, can I hear it
How does it feel
It's all such a mystery

But one kiss and I'll know
If it's really meant to be
I can't let go
They say true love
Is made in heaven

I'm so full of mixed emotions
Does it get to you deep inside
All at once you see that changes
Do you feel like you can face the world

Hear the music, see the lights
To know what it means
When you face your destiny
Will I see it, can I hear
How does it feel
It's all such a mystery

But one kiss and I'll know
If it's really meant to be
I won't let go
They say true love
Is made in heaven
One look and I'll see
No other face 
For all eternity
They say true love
Is made in heaven

One kiss, true love
One kiss, true love

When it calls me
Is it just like music and lights
Or is that just a fairy tale
Will I see it, can I hear it
How does it feel
It's all such a mystery

But one kiss and I'll know
If it's really meant to be
I won't let go
They say true love
Is made in heaven
One look and I'll see
No other face 
For all eternity
They say true love
Is made in heaven
