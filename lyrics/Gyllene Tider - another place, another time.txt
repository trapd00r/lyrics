Time time...

Time
So close that I can touch you,
Give me time
So near that I can breathe you,
Give me time
I don't know why I feel like surrender

Chains
The feeling of the feelings still remains
You're much too old to keep on playing games
I don't why I feel like surrender

And it's a strange feeling, strange feeling I feel inside
And it's a strange beating, strange beating from this heart of mine
I got to run, I got to hide
Another place, another time

Time time
A chill is slowly rolling down my spine
And suddenly I lose the grip on time
The time and the space of time

And it's a strange feeling, strange feeling I feel inside
And it's a strange beating, strange beating from this heart of mine
I got to run, I got to hide
Another place, another time
And it's a strange feeling, strange feeling I feel inside
And it's a strange beating, strange beating from this heart of mine

Time time time
Another place, another time
Time...
