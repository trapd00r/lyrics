[Madonna:]
Move your body
Get me from across the floor
Everybody's watchin'
But I just wanna give you more
Don't care bout nothin'
I'm fallin' for your love in the worst way

[Justin:]
Move closer
I can feel your body rise
The heat from you
And I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

[Chorus (Madonna)]
You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more more more
Than you ever have before

Let's dance tonight dance tonight
And groove around the world
Dance Tonight Dance Tonight
With a boy and with a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight

(Bridge)
Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
Til the lights go on

In our zone
Do you wanna take it further
And before too long
Gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna .......

[Justin:] I'm so into you...
[Madonna:] I've heard it all before
[Justin:] What should I do'
[Madonna:] Get me on the floor
Don''t spoil this moment
Cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste

(Chorus)
