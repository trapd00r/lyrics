When the fury is mixed with love
the flaws are reveled
the action lack an now
IÂ´m face to face I need to say

I still a spirit inside of me
I canÂ´t see fire in your eyes
I need to change my ways
One mistake and say goodbye

So close your eyes and make a wish
IÂ´ll be there, can you see me now?

*So much to say, so many questions
*no answers, I try
*So much to say, so many questions
*I can not sleep tonight

Why? And I can not sleep tonight

Will you remember yesterday?
A silent dance we did into the stairs
burn all feelings, make two become one

Now I lose my wings, no hope, no directions
I need to break the glass, that separates my soul from your
body
