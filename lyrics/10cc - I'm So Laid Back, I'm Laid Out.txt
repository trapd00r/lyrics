The people were running
The place was on fire
The smoke was a-growing
And the flames were getting higher 

The fire chief was shouting
As he knocked down my door
He said you better move your butt boy
Or you'll knock on heaven's door 

I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more
Don't you bug me no more 

The rent needing paying
The insurance was due
The roof needing fixing
And the rain was coming through 

But the forecast is sunny
So I'll stay here on my back
Tomorrow is another day
It's cozy in the sack 

I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more
Don't you bug me no more 

There were times when you wanted to be number one
And the glamour and the glitter were turning him on
But he realized that it was better to be number two (ooh)

My luxury is living
'Cause I can't afford to die
I'm a diletantic mother
With a twinkle in my eye 

Let the others do the running
I'm content to take a cut
Percentages are burning
And I'm happy in my rut 

I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more
Don't you bug me no more
No more, no more, no more,...
