I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flag, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, whoa

I'm breaking in and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa oh... Whoa... I'm radioactive, radioactive
