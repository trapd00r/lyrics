We are getting there darling
This is you and me
Have you thought about it darling
Have you thought about how it feels

I think we've got some answers
Just looking at you now
This is not what happens
when a love is about to die

The rumour you're hearing
is coming straight from me
It's a rumour to rely on
This is how it feels

We're in the middle of it darling
It just occured to me
I haven't thought about it darling
How it really feels
