Everything is good and brown
Oh I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions
Have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh I found
Somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba, oh you and I go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high to get by, hey

Everything is good oh and green
Say I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm comin' down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh that he found
Somebody who he can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba, oh you and I go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high to get by, hey
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high

Now he's here again
Now he's here again
And I don't know what I'd do without him next to me
Everything, everything is good and brown
Now that, now that he's around

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone

Say at the speed of Cheeba
Oh, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high to get by

This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone

Say at the speed of Cheeba, oh you and I go deeper
Hey now we'll go deeper, oh now we'll go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Now we'll go deeper yeah
