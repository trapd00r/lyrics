These postures are cold,
Seems that I'm fine to not to do,
Anything,
Then again,
Who's looking?
This scene's getting old,
Yet I can't seem to take the fact,
I might,
Just give up,
So it goes,
Who's for it?

My eyes have gone numb,
What's the use when I can't see a thing?
Anymore?
Poor,
Tired,
And lonely,

It's what I hear when I'm lost,
And alone in the dark,
This is my song,
It comes in phrases as,
It fits and it starts,
This simple last song,

This town is erased,
Maybe it's just me but all it's spark,
Are all blank,
Who forgot,
To write them?
The wilderness taped,
Shut in back with two bikes and a cigarette,
Machine,
They are all,
Deserted,

It's what I hear when I'm lost,
And alone in the dark,
This is my song,
It comes in phrases as,
It fits and it starts,
This simple last song,

This wall was condemned,
Thought it might decide to fall on a man,
In the night,
To sad,
To notice,
The pieces fall in,
Shattered bricks like the sound of an old,
Dixie band,
Those holy waters,

It's what I hear when I'm lot,
And alone in the dark,
This is my song,
It comes in phrases as,
It fits and it starts,
This simple last song...
