I tell tales tall as cliffs
You've got a lisp
Kid, those things are hard to miss

Like my cripple cough
All your weekends lost by the lake
Well you said I needn't be afraid
Of all those devils on the wall
That make a fella small
When he's feelin' brave
They take his wine away
There were posters on the wall
I swear my mother saw
And I've been up all night
Up all night

And you came well equipped
With a gun on your hip
And some poison on your lips
But when we wake up in our make-up
We'll be clean
And we won't have nowhere to be

Oh, but I can't talk to you
The way I've wanted to
I've been tellin' lies
But I'll tell you the truth

No I can't talk to you
The way I've wanted to
I've been tellin' lies
But I'll tell you the truth

Darlin', I'm tired
And I should be leavin', leavin'
You know I'm tired
And I should be leavin'
Leavin' tonight

Darlin', I'm tired
And I should be leavin', leavin'
You know I'm tired
And I should be leavin'

And you'll hang like the rest
We'll leave a noose on
The attorney's desk
Take to the streets
Chant like an army
And doctor up this disease
