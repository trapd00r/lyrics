Slow, slow fall, slow fall backwards
Slow, slow fall, slow fall backwards

Turn, a turn, a turn with closed eyes
Turn, I took a turn, a turn with closed eyes

When I brought a tear, 
A tear to my mama's eye
When I brought a fear,
A fear to my mama's eye

Play a dark night, dark night by the steep
Play a dark night, dark night by the steep

When I brought a tear, 
A tear to my mama's eye
When I brought a fear,
A fear to my mama's eye

Slow, slow fall, slow fall backwards
Slow, slow fall, slow fall backwards

When I brought a tear, 
A tear to my mama's eye
When I brought a fear,
A fear to my mama's eye
