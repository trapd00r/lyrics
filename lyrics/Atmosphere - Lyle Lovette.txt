Aight, it's a stick up. Put ya hands up!
Put ya hands up! You, put ya fuckin' hands up!
Put ya hands up!

I'm Slug Infinite and he's No Eyedea...

Eyedea:
Please refrain from screamin' this evening
Even though it might ease the pain
You receive when I squeeze that brain
Mayday, Mayday
They say it's quiet once you gotta look out for
Don't you know? Pushin' big words through a little hole
Will leave your mouth tore
Shouldn't kids learn turnin' around and
Puttin' the head down
To save them from burnin' in my circles
Eternal inferno
Purple clouds pour acid rain
And it drowns your perception of a classic
That's the same classic that has 300 parts
And they're all on MTV when I see that video
When all them different versions
I'm turnin' off the TV when it starts
I feel nauseous 'cause its awful
Ridin' old coleslaw slow dump sound somehow got him dough

Slug:
How is it you feel as if you can afford to ignore
The visit come and catch a glimpse of persistence?
The momentum builds and the allied forces get stronger
The breathing lasts longer beyond the patterns of you
The team designated to replace the jaded emotions
Of all the tear player haters, brainwashed in this ocean
The new devotion is the same as the old one
Lyrical bliss, lyricist, tryin' to get up in every city like twist
Wait, wait, wait
Break me down to a science
Bitch save your energy, one part stress, one part Jacob,
One part destiny
And I'm here, and those that knew me, knew I would be overcast
Was a buzz, Big ups to all of those that took me
Now look me in the eye and tell me y'all ain't high,
'Cause I believe there needs to be some fists in the sky,
Put ya hand up bitch! You too. Put ya hand up bitch!
