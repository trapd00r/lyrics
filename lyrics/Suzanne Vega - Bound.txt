The way of the world
Has taken its toll
Ravaged my body
And bitten my soul

I am ruined by rain
Weathered by wind
I've been invaded
Without and within

And I ask
I am asking you
Asking you if you
Might still want me.

Once you said
I'm made of fine stuff.
But I've been corrupted.
And taken enough.

Now you appear.
Making your claim.
Inside my heart
Is the sign of your name.


And I ask
I am asking you
Asking you if you
Might still want me?

All these words
Like darling and angel and dear
Crowd my mouth
In a path to your ear.
The way of the world
Has taken it's toll
Ravaged my body
Bitten my soul

And I ask
I am asking you
Asking you if you
Might still want me?

When I said:
I am bound to you forever
Here's what I meant:
I am bound to you forever.
