Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
Yeah...
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill
Whoaa...
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill
Yeah...
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill
Whoaa...

High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)

Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington
(Where my money at?)
She thought, he'd call
(Where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day (rainy day...)
All he'd wanna know is 
(Where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he'd wanna know is 
(Where my money at?)
She ended up in a roll call, bruised up, scarred heart
All he'd wanna know is 
(Where my money at?)
She thought, he'd call 
(Where my money at?)

So I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin', dollar dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
Singin', dollar dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)
So I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin', dollar dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)

(Akon)
Pimpin' got harder cos hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on the money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hands on their nines
See every day they feel the struggle, but stay on the grind
And ain't nobody take it from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know
There's a drop in the block
You move slow
You gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know, how not to lay low
'cause 25 to life's no joke

To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful womens gettin' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)
See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)

Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drive the world crazy (She used to be...)

Weezy
She used to be the sweetest girl
She used to be the sweetest girl ever (ever)
Ever, now she like Sour Amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by a school
She takes a loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor (pastor)
And he tells her there will be a new chapter (chapter)
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him... Where my money at?

See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, yeah (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, yeah (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)
See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, yeah (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, yeah (dollar, dollar bill, yeah)

Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
Yeah...
(Where my money at?)
She wind for the bill
Grind for the bill
Whoa...
(Where my money at?)
Some steal for the bill if they got to pay the bill
Yeah...
(Where my money at?)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill
Whoa...
Where my money at?
