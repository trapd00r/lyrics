Everything's still the same, mind in the pouring rain
Starting to be a pain, could I :
Spinning right out of sight, out of the dreadful light
Feeling like :. and shout, you can't fix it

Falling to pieces hey, my name will save the day
:. what they say, hang ups let down
Wish I could clean it out, wish I was out of sight
Dead end is coming up, one more :

[Chorus:]
Breakdown, I could need another getaway
Breakdown, are we always gonna stay the same
Breakdown, I could use another brand new day

Caught by a million rules, you haven't got a clue
What I am going through, smashing adults
I have you figured out, know what you're all about
I got the picture right, I can't stand it

[Chorus x2]
That's where I'll keep away

[Chorus]
