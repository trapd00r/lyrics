I've always been a bit strange
Witch one of me is gonna change
Wish there was eight days a week
Hardly got that time to speak
To anyone, except myself

Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one won't go

We'll get myself together
One of us must join the other
Nothing's guaranteed to last
Life is just a plastic cast
Oh, no

Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one won't go
Two into one won't go

I've always been a bit strange
Two into one won't
Witch one of me I gonna change
It won't go
We are just a schizoid men
Help each other best we can
Together? That's impossible
You know, you know

Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one, one
It won't go
Two into one won't go
Two into one won't go
Two into one won't go
Two into one won't go
