Shadow face
Blowing smoke and talking wind
Lost my grip
Fell too far to start again, to start again
A sudden snake
Found my shape and tells the world
Remember this
Remember everything's just black
Or burning sun

And I hope it's a sweet
Ride

Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

Warm and sweet
Swinging from a window's edge
Tight and deep
One last sin before I'm dead, before I'm dead
A sucking, holy wind
Will take me from this bed tonight
And bloody wits
Another hits me and I have to say goodbye

Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

And I hope it's a sweet
Ride
Give up on me tonight
Cause I feel I'm going
Feel I'm slowing down

Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone
Sleep tight for me
Sleep tight for me, I'm gone

And I hope it's a sweet
Ride
Give up on me tonight
Cause I feel I'm going
Feel I'm slowing down
