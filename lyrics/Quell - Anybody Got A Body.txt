Nile I hear you
This sound like Quell

Shawty got that .40 on his hip
And he won't fuckin' slip
Same gun like TIP
Come all the fuckin' hip
And I can't rock with them
Because they rock with 'em
Them streets be a dirty game
It ain't no game, got one life
You better pick and choose
Better pick and choose your side
Better pick and choose
I don't know if he gon' ride so I can't fuck with dude
I done lost a lot of niggas under the sun
Better keep your gun, I got my gun this shit ain't fun

Better keep you gun I got my gun
I ain't goin' for none no one on one
I hop out I run on gang, if he like he know he done
I shoot first ain't shoot no ones
It ain't no pressure on no paper
Tell these hoes these hoes ain't nothin'
Let me speak, let me stand up
Slimelife Shawty I keep it solid
I ain't gotta talk about it
On Insta catchin' bodies
I catch you body, caught a body
This just for him talkin' 'bout me
All on IG tweakin' for his gang like he really 'bout it
Free Lil Rod he really 'bout it
Let me chill 'cause I don't wanna go for life
Let me live, because they took my blood to life
Nah fuck that right hand to God I can't just let you live
Don't let me live it ain't no mercy on these fields
This shit wicked how we live
Wherever slimes gettin' K's in slime I trust
If we die today they dyin' with us
Better get your creep on
The last nigga runnin' to the whip gon' get squeezed on

Shawty got that .40 on his hip
And he won't fuckin' slip
Same gun like TIP
Come all the fuckin' hip
And I can't rock with them
Because they rock with 'em
Them streets be a dirty game
It ain't no game, got one life
You better pick and choose
Better pick and choose your side
Better pick and choose
I don't know if he gon' ride so I can't fuck with dude
I done lost a lot of niggas under the sun
Better keep your gun, I got my gun this shit ain't fun

Better keep your gun, we got our gun, plus we don't pick and choose
That nigga a dumb that boy tried to run, they knocked him out his shoes
Fuck you and your team, y'all go against me, I promise y'all gon' lose
Nowadays these niggas be crazy, I don't know why Ã­'ll ready to die 'bout views
Nowadays this shit be crazy, y'all own niggas don't play by the rules
Only ridin' 'round lowkey lately, ain't nobody got no time to fuck with you
Gotta keep my gun on safety, I never know what I might have to do
One in the head, I don't aim legs, tell me what you wanna do
Breakin' news, put that boy on the television
My dawg a fool, he down to kill everyone
Hoppin' out like fuck that, I'm posted out where your mob at
These niggas be castin' [?]
We both know y'all ain't all that

Shawty got that .40 on his hip
And he won't fuckin' slip
Same gun like TIP
Come all the fuckin' hip
And I can't rock with them
Because they rock with 'em
Them streets be a dirty game
It ain't no game, got one life
You better pick and choose
Better pick and choose your side
Better pick and choose
I don't know if he gon' ride so I can't fuck with dude
I done lost a lot of niggas under the sun
Better keep your gun, I got my gun this shit ain't fun
