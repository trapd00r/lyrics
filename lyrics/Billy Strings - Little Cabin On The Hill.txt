[Verse 1]
Well hello there
My it's been a long long time
How am I doing
Oh well I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away

[Verse 2]
How's your new love
I hope that he's doing fine
Heard you told him, yes baby
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Well it seems like just the other day
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away

[Verse 3]
Got to go now
Guess I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though, oh
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time youâ€™re going to pay

[Outro]
Well ain't it surprising how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it surprising how time slips away
