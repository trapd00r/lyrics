She lights it up like a million sparks
Shootin' from the hips straight through your heart 
When she burns it down, that's my favorite part

Hip-hip-hooray for the dirty looks
How could any city sleep with all these crooks?
Come on take me home is all it took

Yeah, she goes around-round
She goes up, down, and she's goes around
Yeah, she goes around-round
I go up, down, and she goes around

The bourbon drinking hustlers are out tonight
One of them fools wants to make you his wife
But I know better I run from my life

Kiss me on the cheek with peach cream lips
Playing ???? on the jukebox, twirl your hips
Would you dance for me if my songs were hits?

Yeah, she goes around-round
She goes up, down, and she's goes around
Yeah, she goes around-round
I go up, down, and she goes around

Yeah, she goes around-round
She goes up, down, and she's goes around
Yeah, she goes around-round
I go up, down, and she goes around

Yeah, she goes around-round
She goes up, down, and she's goes around
Yeah, she goes around-round
I go up, down, and she goes around

Yeah, she goes around-round
She goes up, down, and she's goes around
Yeah, she goes around-round
I go up, down, and she goes around
