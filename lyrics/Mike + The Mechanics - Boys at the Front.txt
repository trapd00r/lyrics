One two, one two

You're dreamin', your fast Dina has turned sixty-three
You hate readin', you hate ridin', you hate history
Your standing in nomans land till you hear the band checking
One two, (one two, one two)

No Chopin, or Beethoven, just a little R N B
'Cause, in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
You'll be up there to
In your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
There'll be lovin' you

Every weekend it's always the same
The boys watching Eric, the girls watch in vain
And the young contenders sit down here again
There all down here again
Boys at the front

Your hands spinnin', with young women, playin' on your mind
They say traction, but no action, 'cause you don't have the time
Nobody can make you choose, so you play the blues
'Casue you want to (one two, one two)

Young liein', you keep tryin', not to toe the line
'Casue, in your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
You'll be up there to
In your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
There'll be lovin' you

Every weekend it's always the same
The boys watching Eric, the girls watch in vain
And all the young contenders sit down here again
Ain't no trouble going down
Boys at the front

In your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
You'll be up there to
In your dreams, in your dreams, in your dreams
There'll be lovin' you

Every weekend it's always the same
The boys watching Eric, the girls watch in vain
And all the young contenders sit down here again
Ain't no trouble

Every weekend it's always the same
The boys watching Eric, the girls watch in vain
And the young contenders sit down here again
Down here again
Boys at the front

Boys at the front
Boys at the front

Thank you
