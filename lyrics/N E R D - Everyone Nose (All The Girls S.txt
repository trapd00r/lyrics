Superstar, ask you what you had
Bartender give you drinks, you just laugh
(he talkin bout a AUTOGRAPH!)
You just wanna dance in your wreckless path
close your eyes, see colorful things you wanna
let go, feel wonderful things, just a bit more
just to get in tha lane
so we can answer the brain
you're conflicted with pain

Can't be
you partied all night in 6th gear
just so you know
(AT YOUUUUUU)
their chase scene
is blowin over here
don't worry
(AT YOUUUUUU)
I won't blow your high
talkin bout your life
and how we've been so wrong
[AT YOUUUUUU)
just know if you go outside
and see the sun rises
all the stars are gone

(AT YOUUUUU)
Tell your friends
They can go
You're okay
You're just chillin with me
(AT YOUUUUU)
Here's a towel
Wipe your face
Cool down
Have a drink it's on me
