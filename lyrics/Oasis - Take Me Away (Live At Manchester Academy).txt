Just when it falls apart
And when it's time to start
Will you sit down here for another day?

And when it's time to be
All the things that we
Are wishing away for another day

'Cause in my soul we know where we're going
We're going where the grass is green, and the air is clean and the good times are growing
So take me away just for today
'Cause I'm sat here on my own
I'd like to be under the sea
Where they'd probably need a phone

And just when it falls apart
And just when it's time to start
Will you sit down here for another day

'Cause in my soul we know where we're going
We're going where the grass is green, and the air is clean and the good times are growing
So take me away just for today
'Cause I'm sat here on my own
I'd like to be under the sea
But I'd probably need a phone
I could be you if I wanted to
But I've never got the time
You could be me and pretty soon you will be
But you're gonna need a line
Need a line
Need a line
Need a line
