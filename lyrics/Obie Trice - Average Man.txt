Hey yo I'm focused, it's the loc'est
O. Trice is holdin' the soldiers, the prognosis
Probably why I rose from zero to hope
'Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed to my approach (nigga)
Hold the toast you provoke
44 Snub hugs my scrotum when I roll
Yes I hold my own
Swifty think you debo's clone, I'm aimin
Watch 'em switch into Damons
And next Friday I can bet you's a changed man
When them thangs in hands, it's not a game man
I ghost ya, I bring ya much closer to Jehovah
Definition of a soldier, I told ya
I ... hold the toast when I approach
It's close at all times by my side in the holster
O-ster roast ya, make me blow my composure
Pop (*gunshot*) it's all over, when the fo fo blows and goes (*gunshot*)

When I'm up in the club
And these niggaz they wanna act tough
Till they get plugged
Watch them bullets go (*bullet shot*)
Now you touched from a slug
Huggin the streets like you in love
Your heart race like (*flatline*)
The ambulance arrive (*police siren*)
They rush you to the 'spital, flyin by my ride
Engine like (*engine revs*), homie you just died
Your family through cryin, I pulled off a crime
Just as quick as ...

You can lose your face, in a fool's race
I pulled my tool first nigga, you was in second place
And second place just means you didn't react with haste
And this diffrientiates life or murder bein the case
And since murder was the case, it just means niggas erased
Another black mother can't eat the food on her plate
'Cause she ain't got the taste of raisin you wasn't waste
"Such a short span young man" said at your wake
First I'm a man, second I'm five eight, but size and weight
Won't give a nigga the upper hand
'Cause when I pop (*gunshot*), I get a 's up like Barry Sand
Sit in the can, he never ran like Barry Sand
Obie ain't playin', Obie got a plan
And the plan is NOT to be layin in earth's land
I will POP before decaying in earth's land
You get SHOT for playin' me less than a man motherfucker

Niggas get it twisted, liquor make 'em envision
That gangsterism is disrespectin a nigga's wishes
Which is: all the touch talk in front of bitches
Yeah, you fifteen deep, the Desert E a give ya stitches
And I can be all the bitches and hoes you wanna
But I warn ya the glock could make it hot as California
You be propped on the corner, flesh meetin the coroner
O's in quarantine, cause no hoes in need, is no hoes in need
Niggas take advantage till I manage to pull that hammer out
They start scatterin, I'm no gangster, I'm a average man
But be damned if I let 'em do me savage, man
Before that I'm strapped and will challenge him
Cocked back and that (*gunshot*) gat will damage them
It's not a act, this is fact, this is how I'm programmed
This is me, what I'm about, this who I am motherfucker
