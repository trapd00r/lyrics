Part I Haunting Darkness

Haunting darkness forming inside of man
Calling to return the blood of the earth
Baleful shadows gathering under the blackened sky
Reversing the evolution of the forbidden birth

Devastation of the hollow universe
Executed by wrath and absolute power
Completion of the perfect chaos
The pure destruction of stars

I am the immortal shadow
The ruler of dark dimensions
Behold my crimson nightmare
I am the creator of sorrow
Tormentor in the restless night
I am the hunter of fear, the bringer of despair
I am death
I am eternal darkness

Part II The Call of the Dark Dream

Unleash the dark dream, the essence of deception
The fantasy of life will blind you like the flaming sun
The clash of the opposite worlds
The cosmic war of the unnatural state has begun

Embrace the suffering and prepare for transcendent attack
Obliterate the memories and smother the past
And face the unknown! And face the unknown!

Hear the call of the final journey
Hear the call!
Hear the call of the dark dream
Calling from across the stars of old
Hear the call!
Hear the call of the dark dream

Part III Beyond the Infinite Universe

Wandering among the stars... Searching
Beyond the infinite universe
Tearing down the structures
But I can only see darkness

Caressed by the radiant ocean
Soaring high in the waves of sadness
Obsessed by the deepest emotions
Lost in the beautiful silence
Oh the beautiful silence!

Fall!
Falling through the layers of mind
Fall!
As the world is crumbling before my eyes
Falling through the caustic vortex
And my heart is burning by the ultimate lie
The ultimate lie!

Part IV Death

There is no end
There is no beginning
There is no truth
There is only darkness

And I curse you into oblivion!

I curse you for fulfilling your every desire
I curse you for your wild and relentless inner fire
Curse you for your need to breed and multiply
Curse you for your consciousness
The feeble rebellion
The great illusion
The cosmic war

I am the immortal shadow
The ruler of dark dimensions
Behold my crimson nightmare
I am the creator of sorrow
Tormentor in the restless night
I am the hunter of pain, the bringer of rain
I am death
I am eternal darkness

I am eternal
I am death
