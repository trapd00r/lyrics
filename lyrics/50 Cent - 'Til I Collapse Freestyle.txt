We gotta get the get well cards

Niggaz is sick... feel this...

Motion Picture shit


Now Don't think I won't hit you 'cause I'm popular
I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya
Catch ya slippin I'mma give you what I got fa ya
My clip load every 16 shots fa ya
You never had a hot gun on ya waist
And blood on ya shoes
Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
Homey you ain't been through
What I been through
You not like me
And I'm not like you
I'm like a
Animal wit it when I spit it it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas trying to play me
One shot is not enough you need least a oozie to move me
After four bottles of Don the kid starts feelin' woozey
I write my life you write what you seen in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me
I find my space at the top I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you
You heard of me
I murder you
Spit shells through your convertable
Load this you notice
Rich or poor hollows still go through your door
This is war
Ya scared of me ya not prepared for me the kid is back
50 Cent
I know you like that
Yeah I know you like that
