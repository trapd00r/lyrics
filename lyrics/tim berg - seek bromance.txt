Get the hell out of my house!
Are you okay?

I've been watching you
You've been hurting too
You give all your love
Nothing left to show.

I have been there too
Alone in my despair
Watching life go by,
No one whom to share

Boy you got it bad
But I got something good
I will treat you good in every way, yeah
You will never feel alone
My touch is such a rush
It overflows..

I will give to you the love you seek and more
Come on I'm waiting for you
I will give to you
The love you seek and more

I'll get to you the love you seek and more
You're what I'm waiting for you
I will give to you
The love you seek and more

(You're all I really need)
I will get to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I'll get to you the love you seek and more

Baby here we are standing face to face
Just the two of us locked in your embrace
Now I got it bad but you got something good
Won't you treat me good in every way, yeah?
Are you ready?
I can feel your passion and your love
Oh oh ohhh it overflows

I'll get to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I'll get to you the love you seek and more

I got love you seek
I got love you seek
I got love you seek
I got love

I'll get to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for?
I'll get to you the love you seek and more
(The love you seek, baby, it's in me)
The love you seek and more
(You're always want baby)
I'll get to you the love you seek and more
