You've been suffering
Hiding your pain
Unshed tears on the edge
"Just water under the bridge," you say

Is it too late
To make myself a safe place
I could not see
The dangers, the sacrifices
You were making

Hurt you, hurt me
Hurt you
Never meant to hurt you, hurt me

I need to make myself
A safe place for you to cry, baby
'Cause sometimes
Big boys, they need to cry

So we built you some wings
To help you to flee
From your demanding
Dark angel and me

Is it too late
To make myself a safe place
I pushed too far
When we flew too close to our star

It hurt you, hurt me
Hurt you
Never meant to hurt you, hurt me

I need to make myself
A safe place for you to cry, baby
To cry baby
'Cause sometimes
Big boys, they need to cry
