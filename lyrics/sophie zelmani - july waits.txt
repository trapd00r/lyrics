July waits for us sunshine
Having us on its mind
While I’m crying
It holds its summertime

It will be there to watch us
To see if anything has changed
We’ll meet up from fated mornings
And July’s eyes will be so strained

I’m just a little worried
It won’t go so well
I’m just a little worried
For what time will tell

Maybe I am crying
For July is all I know
And if nothing has changed by then
I always will be crying over you

What if I always
Will be crying over you
What if I always
Will be crying over you
