Oh, the age of the inmates
I remember quite freely
No younger than twelve
No older 'n seventeen
Thrown in like bandits
And cast off like criminals
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

From the dirty old mess hall
You march to the brick wall
Too weary to talk
And too tired to sing
Oh, it's all afternoon
You remember your hometown
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, the gates are cast iron
And the walls are barbed wire
Stay far from the fence
With the 'lectricity sting
And it's keep down your head down
And stay in your number
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, it's fare thee well
To the deep hollow dungeon
Farewell to the boardwalk
That takes you to the screen
Farewell to the minutes
They threaten you with it
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunkhouse shingles
And the sounds in the night
They made my ears ring
Well the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, some of us will wind up
In St. Cloud Prison
And some of us will go on
To be lawyers and things
And some of us will wind up
And meet you on your crossroads
From inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing
