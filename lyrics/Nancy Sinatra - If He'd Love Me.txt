Here I am
All alone and crying
Bluer than
I've ever been
In my heart
It feels like I'm dying
Thinking what might have been
If he'd love me
Like I loved him
He was the only one
My heart my soul I gave
He'll be the only one
Whose love I'll always crave
He is the one love
I'll always dream of
Oh, what might have been
If he'd love me
Like I loved him
He is the one love
I'll always dream of
Oh, what might have been
If he'd love me
Like I loved him
Oh, what might have been
If he'd love me
Like I loved him
