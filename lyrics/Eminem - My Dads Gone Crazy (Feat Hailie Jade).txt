Intro:
*Tuning TV* 
*Eminem Snortin Crack 

Tv Presenter: 
Hello boys and girls 
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships 
Do you have a daddy? 
I'll bet you do 

*Door opens* 
who's your daddy? 

Hailie: 
Daddy, what're you doing? 

Beat starts 

Eminem: 
Haha 

Eminem & Hailie: 
Ok then! everybody, listen up! 

Eminem: 
I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me? 

Hailie: 
Somebody, please help him! 
*giggle* 
I think my dad gone crazy! 

Verse #1: 
There's no mountain i can't climb, there's no tower too high, 
No plane that I can't learn how to fly 
What do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you 
There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to 
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound* Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls 
I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar 
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph, 
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall 
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off 
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off 

Dr Dre: 
Suck it Marshall 

Eminem: 
Tell laura and her husband to back off 
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off 
And launch one of these russians, and that's all 
*Hailie Makes Explosion Sound* Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off 
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off 
*Knocking* Haley, tell 'em baby 

Hailie: 
My dad's lost it 

Chorus: 
Eminem: 
There's really nothin' else to say ha, i can't explain it 
Hailie: 
I think my dad gone crazy! 
Eminem: 
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe 
Hailie: 
I think my dad gone crazy! 
Eminem: 
Theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me 
Hailie: 
I think my dad gone crazy! 
Eminem: 
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie 
Hailie: 
I think my dad gone crazy! 

Verse 2: 
It's like my mother always told me 
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom* Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine 
n goddamit, you little motherfucker 
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin' 
Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch, 
eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick 
a million motherfuckin' cocks per second 
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record 
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy 
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring 
in my nose then quit bringin' my flos, 
Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why I'm so 
mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O. 
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo 
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more 
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more? 

Hailey: 
Dad!

Chorus 

Verse #3: 
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise 
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes 
with the same rhyme - so what you're seeing is a genius at work 
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter-
pret it at first, cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek 
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth 
before i'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums, 
get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once 
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son 
And walk around the rest of my life spit on 
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung 
Like R. Kelly as soon as Bump 'n Grind comes on 
More pain inside o' my brain, 
than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane 
aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave, 
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather it's [Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade]
And that's pretty much the gist of it 
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it 
Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers 
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither 

Chorus 

Outro: 
Eminem: 
Crazy 

Hailie: 
*laughs* 
You're funny daddy!
