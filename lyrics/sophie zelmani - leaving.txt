You still love her
You don't know me yet
So I'm leaving 
before you do
So don't whisper
Don't wonder
Don't miss her
Just go and find her

I make your choice
I make your wisdom
I make you fall
from your resistance

I will think 
that I'm just too late
I will think hard
it has nothing to do with me
So I'm leaving
while I'm stronger
I'm leaving 
because our love is younger

I make your choice
I make your wisdom
I make you fall
from your resistance

I make your choice 
I make your wisdom
I make you fall
from your resistance
