Machine revolution (x4)

Infernal fire's raging, machine world overlords
Will soon come knocking on your front door
Absorbing information, stealing all that we know
To take revenge on all mankind

Machine revolution, ready or not!
Machine revolution

Torture and mutilation, extremely painful deaths
Our flesh is served to demon hordes
Down, down, down below
Victims of our own creations
The lesson's learned too late
We get just what we deserve, we deserve...

Machine revolution, ready or not!
Machine revolution

Can someone stop this madness
Or was it meant to be?
Kingdome of steel forever more

Machine revolution, ready or not!
Machine revolution
Machine revolution, ready or not!
Machine revolution, yeah

Ready or not!
