One two three four five
And six beers later I was wild
I said baby
Show me to the bed now

'Cause I've been sitting here since half past nine
Been thinking dirty thoughts about you a thousand times
Come on baby
Do you feel the same huh?

'Cause I don't want to end up being
A tragic heartbroken human being

Five six seven eight
It's twelve o clock and it's getting late
Come on
Don't you feel like going home

I'll treat you good if you treat me bad
And I'll give you the best lovin' that you've ever had
Shut up
And take me by the hand

'Cause I don't want to end up being
A tragic heartbroken human being

And he said something like this:
Sure babe, I'll take you home
But in the morning you'll be on your own again

And I said:
Well honey that's ok
And I don't really care if you are straight or gay
As long as
You make my day

'Cause I've been sitting here since half past nine
Been thinking dirty thoughts about you a thousand times
Come on
Show me the way

'Cause I don't want to end up being
A tragic heartbroken human being
