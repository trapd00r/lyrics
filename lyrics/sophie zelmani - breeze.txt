My heart is leaving you
it says goodbye
Disappering from you tonight
Not a breeze is gonna
pass you by

There are sailingboats
There are shops
Broken rafts adrift
I'm jumping on
what ever's passing by

I've blown tha candle out
that you forgot
I've made sure that
the door is shut
I don't think you're ever
coming back

My heart is leaving you
It's says goodbye
Disappering from you tonight
Not a breeze is gonna
pass you by
