It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (fussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect 
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you mad
I'm sorry that seeing you mad is so sexy

(Hook)
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around 
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

(Chorus)
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better 
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

(Hook)
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around 
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

(Chorus 2x)
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy
When you're mad
