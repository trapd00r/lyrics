He said get out of here nobody wants you here
You smashed his head and the man died
And there's a murmur loud from the appearing crowd
Searching for motives and reasons why

Now take a look at yourself and you'll see
What you are in the eyes of the world
You didn't want it but now he is dead
And you're on the run from the law

Murderer in every town
Murderer to the whole world
Murderer you're on the run
Murderer you'll have to kill… again

And like an animal which escaped from the cage
They're hunting you over their holy land
Traps waiting everywhere you fall in deep despair
Darkness and night your only friends

One day the chase will be over for you
And you'll find your own peace in the end
Some day you will find a sanctuary
Death!… but so long my friend…

Murderer in every town
Murderer to the whole world
Murderer you're on the run
Murderer you'll have to kill… again

Look for a safe place where no one will find you
And try to escape from the law
Wherever you are there's a killer behind you
Wanting to get you for sure

To lose the fear that one day he will get you
Be faster and kill him and run
Now you don't have to fear him no more
But in his place another headhunter will come
…run away!!!

He said get out of here nobody wants you here
You smashed his head and the man died
And there's a murmur loud from the appearing crowd
Searching for motives and reasons why

Now take a look at yourself and you'll see
What you are in the eyes of the world
You didn't want it but now he is dead
And you're on the run from the law

Murderer in every town
Murderer to the whole world
Murderer you're on the run
Murderer you'll have to kill…

Murderer in every town
Murderer to the whole world
Murderer you're on the run
Murderer you'll have to kill… again
