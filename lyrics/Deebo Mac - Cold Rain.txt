that be killin for a long time but now it don't happen
all them tough guys is wanksters they ?? me in their songs
im a braveheart till death so I got to die strong
a big man that's troublesome and follow no rules
run through crews after smoking blunts and sippin on brews
disrespecter pistol whippin hustlers for their cheddar
the deebo of the rap game but walk with a beretta
my heart is made of stone my eyes is filled with blood
survivors of the street wars yall niggas know whats up
from the projects to penthouse yall niggas better look out
before these braveheart motherfuckers put they gun in your mouth
