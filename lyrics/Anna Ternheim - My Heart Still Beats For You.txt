Hard to believe how people move
Falling out of love with you
Tearing down all the walls and love, the chaos

Thought again, of driving by, the place we meet
You and I, where it started, how we lived, together always

My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
After all, it's always you

You came down, hard that summer
I started to dance, remember
Everything, not a thought of you
And I lied alot too
Maybe to forget you

My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
After all, it's always you
I come back too 
I come back too you
I come back too you
I come back too you
