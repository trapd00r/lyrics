(Eminem)
Naw
We ain't done
I love bein' hated, it's great it
Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only lets me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers
That hate you in this buzz
You keep fuckin' with us
We keep fuckin' you up
And keep pullin' the rug from up under you
And what's even more fucked up
Is we enjoy what were doin' so much
There ain't nothin' that we love more
Than pullin' your skirts up
And exposin' you hoes so much
People are startin' to wonder
What's up with the fuckin'
Wonder Woman underoos?
Do onto others as you will have done onto you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to?
When someone runs up with a mask
And puts a gun to you
You will ask yourself how come your man's
Didn't enter the last round that he had
In Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin' us to keep it on wax, but we can't
This is past any rationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension
Start buildin' soon as we enter the 106 and Park Building
Someone's gonna get killed
And I swear to God if someone so much as even
Touches one of my people I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I rather rap than get into this gangster shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's 'cause I ain't a bitch
I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general
I ain't Bush
I don't send my soldiers to war if I ain't there
In the middle of this shit with em
So when I do get em
Orders to storm your head quarters
You be fuckin' with a

(Swifty)
A beat keeper, so you ain't eager
To greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That'll eat ya, niggers wanna keep speakin'
Like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a nigger's streets
So ya wouldn't fuck with me neither
Only heaven can help ya
I be searchin' for ya longer
Than The Legend of Zelda
Without a failure
It's gonna be Hell to tell the
Captain that a basset hound
Couldn't even smell ya
Body wanna hide ya
I'll be on that mob shit
You another hopper
Under the Renaissance, bitch
You get bombed like Lebanon with
On tactic
I'll snatch your head like one Saddam's men

(Obie Trice)
Motherfucker, I'll handle you
We can have it out on any avenue
An Average Man, flipped into an animal
Shoot out ya mandibles
Cannons and ammunition reload
With precision, nigger know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down you should see them handles
The streets taught the child no read up manuals
Pushin' crack valves, young Nino Brown
Chasin' green is the dream
When you're young and brown
Bound to be a problem child
Look what I'm involved in now
A Dozen Dirty niggers and they all get down
I'll solve any problem that enlarge
When I was on revolvers
We all get down

(Kuniva)
While you punchin' and tacklin' punks
I'm handlin' chumps, packin' the pump
That's longer than the elephant's trunk
On the streets I'm the beast, I'll feast
Upon the weak, so speak beef
I'll shoot you and scream
Increase the peace
The monster, pistol packin'
Pushin' niggers off they Hondas
Stomp ya, get it crackin'
Yankin' bitches for they Ganja
Sneaky as fuck
I don't think mamma beat me enough
When she was sleepin' and stuff
I was stealin' the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up
Before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin' a nap
Bleedin' and locked up
You want what?
Like M Bleak with this heat
If your ten deep, then fuck
It'll be ten asleep

(Proof)
Don't mess with my alasnke
Don't tussle with my aspe
Clutch your burner
Bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast, don't host us
Approach us
Through heat straight from the shoulders
We the soldiers, you're the youngster's
Youngster's among
Aren't ya dead in the dumpster?
Say to the monster head full of drama
You scared of the trauma
Vomit to monster
(Woof!) I'm back nigger
(Poof) I reappear
Shoot like, you ain't seein' clear
Blackness, carcass, cover with catfish
We mercers with no purpose
Other than practice

(Bizarre)
Theirs three things I hate
Liars, fakes, and cheaters
Alcohol, and sluts, and fuckin' wife beaters
I guess that describes my life
I don't even know whose song this is
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck
About no Hip-Hop
At my release party
In a pink tank top in Reebok's
This Ja Rule beef, I'm not gettin' in
I need an R&B singer
To sing at my weddin' (Say yeah)
I'll turn your face into a fuckin' meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy
And go fishin' with your granny
I'll shit on you
I'll pee on R Kelly too
This is Bizarre
See you in Devil's Night 2
