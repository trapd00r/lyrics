You might remember this better than I do, actually.

-Okay? ...something about a flat top that's all I know...
One, two, ah-one, two, three, four-

(Shhhoop-)
Here come ol' flat top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got joo joo eyeball, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker 'cause he's so hard to please

(Shhhoop- shhhoop- shhhoop- shhhoop-)

He wear no shoeshine, he got walrus gumboot
He got monkey finger, he shoot cola cola
He say I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together, right now
Over you

(Just for a change...)

(Shhhoop-)

He bag production, he got ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker, he got early walkers
He say hair, belief, under his knees
Hold you in his arms till you can feel his disease

Come together, right now
Over me

-Oww!

He roller coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he want mucho filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see

Come together, right now
Over me... over you... over there...(shhhoop-)

Come together, -ah, come together, -ay!

-Thank you, thank you... I nearly got all the words right too!
I, uh, I'll have to stop writin' those daft words, man...
-I don't know what I'm sayin'!
