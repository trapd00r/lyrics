and a go dead inna di road

their devil strategy plan out pon board 
some a dem a walking time bomb ready fi explode 
look out for dem pure blood dem a shed 
dem a walking dead pure blood dem a shed

weak a tremble n quiver 
for being in the wrong place at the wrong time 
innocent people pay the ultimate crime 
everywhere you go a pure war & crime 
open up your eyes nuh baddah gwaan like you are blind 
just look out for dem pure blood dem a shed 
dem a walking dead pure blood dem a shed
