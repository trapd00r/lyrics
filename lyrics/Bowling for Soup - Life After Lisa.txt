I'm waking up and baking
Watching the parade
'Cause today's the day I got over you
Taking out the trash and the pictures that I stashed
Of the two of us in 1992
You stole my heart when Eddie Vedder was king
I gave you a foot massage
I gave you my ring
You left me for a drummer 'cause you said I couldn't sing
But that's ok

'Cause there'll be no more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same
Life after lisa's not so bad at all

Saw you with the dude who gave us
Our first tattoos
Did he cover up my name
That was fast
Can you believe that I'm alive
Still not workin' 9 to 5
And my little band is kickin some ass

So when you ask me if I hated you now
It's not you it's just all of the times I missed out
On sleeping with your roommate
Every time you passed out
But that's okay

And now there's no more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all

I bet you're saying to yourself
That you'll find somebody else like me
All I've got to say is there ain't no fucking way
That you're getting me to say I'm sorry
Not today

No more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same

Cleaning up the house again
Listening to house of pain
Having headaches in my brain
Listening to you complain
Shopping at the mall again
I'm outta rhymes I've gotta say
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all
Not so bad at all

No more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all
Oh no not so bad at all
