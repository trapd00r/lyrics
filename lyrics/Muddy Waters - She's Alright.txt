Well, I was gone
Gone to the army
I was gone, ver' long time
Well, when I come back home, my baby
Still says she's mine
She still says she's mine
She still says she's mine
She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right

Well, I give 'er
Give her all a-my money
Tell me what more, can I do?
Well now, I really don't
Wanna b'lieve she gon'
She's gon' give it to you
She gon give it to you

She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right

Well, I went
Went to the church-house
And I kneeled on my knees to pray
I got to thinkin' about that girl
She drove my
She drove my spirit away
She drove my spirit away
She drove my spirit away

She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right

Well, I could-a
Could-a had religion
Well, this bad old same day
Tell now, whiskey an' women, won't now
Let the ol' poorboy pray
Let the poorboy pray
Let the poorboy pray

She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right
