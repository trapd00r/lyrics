I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes
And I certainly haven't been spreading myself around
I still only travel by foot, and by foot it's a slow climb
But I'm good at being uncomfortable
So I can't stop changing all the time

I notice that my opponent is always on the go
And won't go slow, so's not to focus, and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide
As long as they go fast from whence he came
But he's no good at being uncomfortable
So he can't stop staying exactly the same

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day
You deem me due to clean my view and be at piece and lay
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way, and say
I've been getting along for long before you came into the play

I am the baby of the family, it happens, so
Everybody cares and wears the sheep's clothes while they chaperone
Curious, you're looking down your nose at me while you appease
Courteous to try and help, but let me set your mind at ease

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

Do I so worry you
You need to hurry to my side? It's very kind
But it's to no avail
And I don't want the bail
I promise you, everything will be just fine

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

If there was a better way to go, then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine
