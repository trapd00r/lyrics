5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
Heaven sent me a dancing Queen
Oh I love the way you look at me, yeah yeah...
Everybody desiring you,
Doesn't matter now you're already mine

Pretty baby you're killing me,
Come on open your doors
And tell me your dreams
This space and times don't exist for me,
Leave your bad past behind you,
And give me your love, ooh

Give me a reason to believe in you baby,
I need your body really close to mine,
Show me the wonders that you hide in you lady,
I'm crazy for you tonight, ooh (2x)

5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

Hold me close and don't let me go,
And I'll say that we are livin' our love, yeah
Yeah...
There's something special about you girl,
And I'm ready for your body now

Pretty baby you're killing me,
Come on open your doors
And tell me your dreams
This space and time don't exist for me,
Leave your bad past behind you,
And give me your love, ooh

Give me a reason to believe in you baby,
I need your body really close to mine,
Show me the wonders that you hide in you lady,
I'm crazy for you tonight, ooh (2x)
