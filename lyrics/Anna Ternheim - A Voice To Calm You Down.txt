By the end of the day
Left only with my godless mind
On my way home again

By the end of the night
Falling star is your guiding light
In the way that you're so fine

Voice is calming you down
Voice from deep down
Open your mind now
Let it calm you down
Keep you calm now

By the end of it all
On your knees running fast
Either God are escaping your past
By the end
Who will give you answers
When you, man-senses fail
By the end
Who will give you answers
When you, man-senses fail
