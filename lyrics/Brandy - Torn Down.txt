Built this love in 24 hours
Laid it brick by brick by brick
Reached my limit screaming gimmie more power
I cannot quit, won't quit

Don't tell me I can't build Rome in a day
Just 'cause they couldn't do it
If I took a whole lifetime try'na find a way
I'd be feeling useless
I'm gonna love you right now

And it's so strong don't know how
Can't be torn down
So strong don't know how
Can't be torn down
So strong don't know how
Can't be torn down

They don't know how our love is still standing
They won't get it naw they won't they won't
Shake the foundation
Just to try to do damage
They can try babe all they want

Don't tell me I can't build Rome in a day
Just 'cause they couldn't do it
If I took a whole lifetime try'na find a way
I'd be feeling useless
I'm gonna love you right now

And it's so strong don't know how
Can't be torn down
So strong don't know how
Can't be torn down
So strong don't know how
Can't be torn down

We're high up baby
Love sky scraping
I might be crazy
But I think when we're gone
Our love gonna still stay strong
Because of the way we made it
'Cause of the way we made it
'Cause of the way we made it
'Cause of the way we made it
We made love

Don't tell me I can't build Rome in a day
Just 'cause they couldn't do it
If I took a whole lifetime try'na find a way
I'd be feeling useless
I'm gonna love you right now

And it's so strong don't know how
Can't be torn down
So strong don't know how
Can't be torn down
So strong don't know how
Can't be torn down

I'm gonna love you right now
Torn down
So strong don't know how
Can't be torn down
