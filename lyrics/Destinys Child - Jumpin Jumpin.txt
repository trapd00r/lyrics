[Chorus]
Ladies leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers
And they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave your girl
With her friends
'Cause it's 11:30, and the club is
Jumpin', jumpin' 

So you say you've got a girl?
Yes, do you got a man?
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So lets make it hot, hot! 

Last weekend you stayed at home
Alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man 
He was chillin' with his homies
This weekend you goin' out 
If he try to stop you, you goin' off
You got cha hair done and your nails done too
And your outfit and you're in your shoes
You parlaying at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the brothas
Rollin in the Lexus, trucks, and Hummers 

So you say you've got a girl?
Yes, do you got a man?
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So lets make it hot, hot! 

[Chorus x 2]

So you say you've got a girl?
Yes, do you got a man?
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So lets make it hot, hot! 

Call your boys 
'Cause tonight you're not gon' stay at home
So tell your girl she ain't coming tonight 
You're goin' solo
Cut her off if she talks some noise
You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your hair cut and your car washed too
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit
You need to look your best 'cause
You're turnin' heads tonight
You're gonna find a sexy chica
That's gon' dance all night if ya want to 

So you say you've got a girl?
Yes, do you got a man?
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So lets make it hot, hot! 

[Chorus]

Sexy women do your dance 
Fly ladies work your man
All them fellas in the club 
Who can get down now?

Bounce with me, bounce, bounce
Bounce, papis work
Shake, baby, shake, shake, shake, work it, work it
Twist, baby, twist, twist, twist
You better dip that thang 

Sexy women do your dance 
Fly ladies work your man
All them fellas in the club 
Who can get down now?

Bounce with me, bounce, bounce
Bounce, papis work
Shake, baby, shake, shake, shake, work it, work it
Twist, baby, twist, twist, twist
You better dip that thang 

[Chorus]
