Geri:
You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool, but you don't even know me

Mel C:
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win. you're always right behind me

Emma:
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother

Victoria:
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever?

All:
Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last

Mel B:
Don't you know, what can't you see?

Mel C:
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

All:
Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Do do-do do, do do-do do, do do-do
Always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba
Stay that way forever

Emma:
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it 'cause we've always got each other

Mel C:
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna break down
You're crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around

All:
Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last

Mel B:
Don't you know, what can't you see?

Mel C:
Slow it down, read the signs so you know just where you're going

All:
Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Gotta keep it down, honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money
Don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down, baby, just get out of my face

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down, baby, gotta have some fun

(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you)
(Wanna thank you) I need somebody with the human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much) Gotta slow it down, baby
(Thank you very much) Gotta have some fun
