(mmm...Hey! All right now! ooh)
Ain’t I got you on your back foot
And you know I got you really good
Cuz there’s something deep inside of me
I've got to be

And if you find it hard to follow me
If I loose you in my jet stream
Than you only got to raise your eyes
And see me fly

Don’t tell me that I won’t
I can
Don’t tell me that I’m not
I am
Don’t tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming true (yeah!)

Don’t tell me that I won’t
I will
Don’t tell me how to think
I feel
Don’t tell me cause I know what’s real
What I can do

Something that you don’t see every day
A little girl who found her way
Through a world that's designed to break
All of your dreams

And if there’s one thing I will say to you
It's that there is nothing that you can’t do
Cuz it’s all about your attitude
Don’t let them get to you

Don’t tell me that I won’t
I can
Don’t tell me that I’m not
I am
Don’t tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming true

Don’t tell me that I won’t
I will
Don’t tell me how to think
I feel
Don’t tell me cause I know what’s real
What I can do

(Oh yeah! Yeah! ooh ooh (giggle) mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm Hey! ooh yeah!)

And we are singing in our own voice
We can make the choice to be free (to be free now!)

And we are singing it our own voice
We can make the choice to be free (to be free now!)

Music hey L.U.V. I love it (yeah hey eh yeah!)
Music, now, now, now eh L.U.V. baby I love it (eh) yes I do now

Don’t tell me that I won’t
I can
Don’t tell me that I’m not
I am
Don’t tell me that my master plan
Ain't coming true
Don’t tell me that I won’t
I will
Don’t tell me how to think
I fell
Don’t tell me cause I know what’s real
What I can do

Free me (EMI) (x15)
