[Chorus]
I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of law suits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit
Ah shhh
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick
And lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shhh start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house doin mass amounts
To the women in the thongs put they asses out
We don't bull shhh, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb and's dashing town
Bizarre, your mom is crashing out
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out

[Kon Artist & Kuniva]
Bug that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestling with Elton John
Hey Von
You see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It gotta be Tums the X-lax is gone
Ya I took them all dog with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
Naw, it's probably numb
Dumb, dumb, and full of ....
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on
So stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shhh
I think I did too much
I think I got the runs
Rolaids, Pepto and Tums
Watch out, here it comes

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Dirty Dozen
80 of us
Shady brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some-, something, something, something
Mmmmm, I dunno

[Proof]
Hop hills
Hills I hop
Hop two hills
On stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible I killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna go for broke
No Okie Doke
I overdose
When I pack up my nose with soap
*cough cough cough*
Am I supposed to choke
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by wh... lady
Now I'm payin child support
(It's your baby!)

[Swifty]
I take four shots at one time
And I don't need to chase when I'm swallowing mine
(Yo, you got any room?)
In Bizarre's hatchback?
We can't go farCuz the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me how to reach contracts
If you cash
Then hide it so
(Swift, chill)
I'm just tryin to get by like you
And I don't give a damn if you find me rude
Mean, crude the hell wit you too
I only need 3 blunts and I'm cool
I just copped some and I'm going back soon

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
I'm at rave
Looking at a babe
Like she want it
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Luny, crazy, tubby, sexy,
dopey headed guy
Whip cream, dirty matresses
Wanna try
Blue hills, broken seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (Yeah, right)
Chick I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night

[Chorus]
