The sky's got no eyes
Is that way people suffer
Why the good are crawling
Just to die
We are blind
Is that way we're judging
Cause we're all in need
Of being right
The good guys
Write themselves with pain
The bad guys
Just admit that it's insane
It's not easy to live here
The sky's got no eyes
Is that why life's a mystery
It's so expensive with honesty
In our hearts
Take your time
There's no reason for saving
There's no reason for praying
For a long life
Cause those who care
They pass away
Those who don't
They have to stay here
It's not easy to live here
The sky's got no eyes
I think the Gods play tricks on us
If they are Gods they play tricks on us
Fairness just exist in their minds
In their sparetime
It's not easy to live here
But as a comfort
It's just a black hole out there
