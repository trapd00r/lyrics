Bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam

And suddenly, I don't feel fat anymore
I don't count my blackheads as a hobby
I don't count the marks on the wall
And I don't sleep well at all

There is someone else right beside me
He kept every secret I told
He giggled his way straight through fall
And I don't sleep well at all

Bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam
Bam, bam, bam

I have seen too many movies
I have read, I read too many books
I'm the kind that sees sun and brings an umbrella
I have been to fortune tellers

He knows when I'm happy and nods when I'm sad
And he puts out when I come home drunk
And suddenly I stand real tall
But I don't sleep well at all

And I know love will leave you all crooked
And I know he'll start sleeping around
Or start listening to symphony rock
Or throw out the key and change the lock
But I don't sleep well at all
