Don't walk too close
Don't breathe so soft
And don't talk so sweet
Don't sing
Don't lay oh so near
Please, don't let me fall in love with you again

Please, let me forget
All those sweet smiles
All of the passion
All of the heat, the peace, the pain
And all those blue skies
Where your words were my freedom
Please, don't let me fall in love with you again

Too many times
I've cared too much
I stood on the edge
And saw that you held my hand
And knowing too well
I couldn't hide from those eyes
Please, don't let me fall
Please, don't let me fall in love with you again
