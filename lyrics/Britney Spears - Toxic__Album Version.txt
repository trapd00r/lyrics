(Verse 1)
Baby can't you see, I'm callin
A guy like you should wear a warnin
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, Baby give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

Too high, Can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Do you feel me now

(Chorus)
With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic

(Verse 2)
It's gettin late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now

(Chorus)
With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic
Don't you know that you're toxic

Taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

Intoxicate me now, with your lovin now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin now
I think I'm ready now
