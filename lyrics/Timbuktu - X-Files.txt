This healing ritual called 'The Blessing Way' has been passed down by our ancient Navajo ancestors. It's songs and prayers must be followed just as they have been for centuries, or the Holy People will not be summoned. I watched my father perform the chants as a young boy and saw their healing magic.

If the struggle to continue is too hard or the wish to join his ancestors too strong, the body will give up. But if the desire to resume life burns brightly enough, the Holy People will be merciful.
