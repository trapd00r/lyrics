In Those days

Nothing to lose in my life
Only innocense

If you can forgive me now

The spiral of the light

I didn't know my own sins

I didn't know others lies
The rain became a stream

And flows in the sea of blood

I spend all my sinful days
The light breaks with no care
But i have no fear of anything
So i want that from you

Now it's something i can feel

Please do it for me now
