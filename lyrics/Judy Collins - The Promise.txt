From the beginning of time
Like a heartbeat that never can die
Like the wind on the sea like the sun on the sand
Like a baby's cry
We've had a dream in our hearts
That gives us the courage to try
We must have a song that says we can be strong
We must reach for the sky

We are the daughters of time
And the sisters of a new day
Born in the labor of love
And the promise of tomorrow
We are the children of light and we are here today
We are here to stay
The suns and the daughters of time

We are no longer alone we are no longer afraid
We can reach out with our hands and our hearts
That's how dreams are made
Over the water so wide
Like a bird that sails on through the sky
We know the way to be the best we can be
And look life in the eye

We are the daughters of time
And the sisters of a new day
Born in the labor of love
And the promise of tomorrow
We are the children of light and we are here today
We are here to stay
The suns and the daughters of time

Just like the lady in the harbor shining bright
Giving her hope in the darkest of the nightJ
Ust like the lady in the harbor standing tall
Now we know we are together one and all

We're on our way to the stars
Nothing can turn us away
We will survive and our dream is alive of a better day
There is a way to find peace
Turning away from the past
With love for our brothers and sisters on earth
We'll have a new world at last

We are the daughters of time
And the sisters of a new day
Born in the labor of love
And the promise of tomorrow
We are the children of light and we are here today
We are here to stay
The suns and the daughters of time
