So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference
How the tears are cried
It's over

And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
When it's over
I'm just an empty shell
With nothing for tomorrow
I'm here to face the sorrow
The dreams we shared were far and wide

Got to give a little of the love inside
Not to take it all
And watch me fall
I got me lovin' you
I had you lovin' me

And we both played along
Love is easy on the young
Life was together
As the world fades away
Into yesterday
I'm losing you forever

But we can't take it home
The fire that was burning
When all the room was turning
And we were cruising for the ride

Got to give a little of the love inside
Not to take apart
This breaking heart
I got me lovin' you
I had you lovin' me
