She wakes up, she finds herself sleeping in a doorway
Wondering how she ever got that way
She fights her tears away, then prays for no more sorrow
Will tomorrow be the same as yesterday

She tasted from the tree of life which lead to hunger
Now she wonders how she'll ever carry on
She thinks about the life she knew when she was younger
Heaven help her now those days are long since gone

She wakes up, she finds herself sleeping next to no one
And it's no fun when there's no one's there to see
She looks down at her feet, "My God, they sure look dirty
7:30, time to be or not to be"

She cries out, "Won't somebody listen to my story
Mournin' glories aren't supposed to happen today
She wakes up, she finds herself sleeping in a doorway
Wondering how she ever got that way
