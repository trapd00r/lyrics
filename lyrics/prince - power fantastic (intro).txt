Late at night, when the world is sleeping
You are frightened, 'cause the power's creeping
In your room it's something you're afraid of
Life or doom is what this feeling's made of

Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
You're a little apprehensive
'Cause what it is is what you want and need

Minor g is the chord of pleasure
It will be played eleven measures
You will see fire, but you're cool as ice
You lyin' if you say this isn't nice

Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a little apprehensive
What it is is what you want and need

Power, power

Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a wee bit apprehensive
'Cause what it is is what you want and need

Power, power, power fantastic
