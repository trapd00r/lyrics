One child stood before the altar
One child stood out in the rain
One child spent his time imagining
And I don't believe he's coming home again, home again, home a...

Right there in the earth, I've been drawing a line
I'm digging it deep, don't know if I'll find
A tunnel out so we all can be saved
If not, just take this earth and bury me, for this will be my grave

One child hid inside the darkness
One child never said a thing
One child closed his eyes and disappeared
But at night I still can hear him whispering, whispering, whisper...

Right there in the earth, I've been drawing a line
I'm digging it deep, don't know if I'll find
A tunnel out so we all can be saved
If not, just take this earth and bury me, for this will be my grave

I will believe in you
If you still want me to
Or tell me I'm on my own
There on the other side
Tell me the Pilate's died
And we're no longer alone

Take your answers and your promises, believe me I don't care
I have held on to your words until I found them only air
What good are your promises if you can always take them back?
Still, I hang on every word till my hands are bleeding

I will believe in you
If you still want me to
Or tell me I'm on my own
There on the other side
Tell me the Pilate's died
And we're no longer alone

I will believe in you (We had no choice but to stay and follow)
If you still want me to (We have nothing left except tomorrow)
Or tell me I'm on my own (We have nothing left except what will be)
There on the other side (What we need here are some real decisions)
Tell me the Pilate's died (While you only offer mindless visions)
And we're no longer alone (Visions that nobody else here can see)
