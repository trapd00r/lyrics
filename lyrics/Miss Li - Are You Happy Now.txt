You pretty perfect girl
Did you get the life you wanted
In your pretty little perfect world
There's no room for broken hearted

Dress up, put ypur make-up on
Lipstick will hide your lying
Get up, put your fake smile on
Don't show that you've been crying

Poor pretty little rich dads girl
Do you always have to be elected
Poor pretty little rich dads girl
Have you done what's been expected

Dress up, put your make-up on
Be a good girl now be charming
Get up, put your fake smile on
Be everybodys darling

Are you happy now
Got a perfect life

Are you happy now
Got a perfect smile

Are you happy now
Got a perfect life

Are you happy now
Got a perfect smile

Are you happy now
Happy now
