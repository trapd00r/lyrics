You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied

Love is made,
Made of many things
And one of them is trust
But I can't trust you anymore
Things you say (say) how about the things you do?
They won't hurt me, no
They won't hurt me anymore

You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied

Love can make,
Make a stronger man
But you don't love me
(You don't love me)
And I don't feel you're always strong
The hearts you break
With your simple lies
And you better watch out baby
The next heart may be your own

I gave you
My love, my life, my time
Mine was your own
Though you stripped me to the bone
When I asked you how you feel,
If our love was the deal
You told me, we got it goin' on
Now I feel that love is gone

You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied

I'm alright,
I'm alright
I gave you
My love, my heart and soul
You took my love
Now you want to take control
When a good thing comes your way
Why can't you stay
I can't go on another day

You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied

You know I'm gonna be alright
You know I'm gonna be alright
You know I'm gonna be alright
Why why why
You know I'm gonna be alright
You know I ain't satisfied
You know I'm gonna be alright
