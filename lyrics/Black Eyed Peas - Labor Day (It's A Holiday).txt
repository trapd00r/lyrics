When I stepped in the room
I bring the heat like the month of June
Crank the volume make the bass go boom
Wile out like we some wild baboons
We go bananas to the tune
I wanna throw bows gimme elbow room
Move nigga
When I'm out my cacoon I'm ready to consume
Let's hit the saloon 'cause...

It's a holiday
Pardon me as I celebrate

And that's the way we do it
We get a lil loopy off the ignorant fluid
And act a lil stupid
Just in case you didn't knew it
And that's just how we do it
Don't ask why we do it

That's just the way it be
Lovin' double Ds up at the ad
When I party in Hollywood VIP
I don't understand s.t.o.p, 'cause

We partay forever
'N' get down together
We don't stop-no 'n' we don't quit
Let's get it goin' 'cause you know we gon'
Celebrate
'Cause it's a holiday
I don't work today or the next 3 days
So lets celebrate!
'Cause it's a holiday

So pardon me as I celebrate

Its time to celebrate
Serving up beat box on a hot plate
Like that y'all
We on a festive date
Make it go ape 'n' raise ur heart rate
We gon stay out late- party till the morning 'n' wake up late
We do it till the day break
Go on 'n' on then on 'n' on n
Dance to my rhyme
I can holla acapelas deaf till ya blind
Ur mine baby
Take ya to the mafia behind bay-be
Take a super moment just recline bay-be
Cock me over back like super-9 bay-be--yeah

Girl we don't quit -nope we don't quit-nope we don't quit

Move yo body-'n' push it get naughty-'n' push it 'cause...

It's a holiday pardon me as I celebrate
Its time to get wasted 'n' scope the whole place
For girls with cute faces
'Cause I see some fly mommas so pack your pajamas
But don't bring the drama
But you can bring ur melody
I plug in my mic 'n' sing my harmonies (la la la la)
For how many times we gonna hit it
For how many times we gonna split it
How many times ur gonna get it
Or else u r gonna
Wanna come sober
Ur gonna have to wanna (man) 'cause I'm the alligator champ
Drivin' a train drivin' a train
Or you can bring a friend 'n' switch my lane
N get buddy buddy with ur friend mary jane
She really blows my brain (brain)
She really blows my brain (brain)

We party forever
'N' get down together
We don't stop no 'n' we don't quit. (yeah-a-a-a!)
Let's get it goin' 'cause we know
