Chorus: letâs get loud, letâs get loud
Turn the music up, letâs do it
Câmon people letâs get loud
Letâs get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Letâs get loud, letâs get loud
Ainât nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do

If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way and donât you waste it
Every feelinâ every beat
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it
You gotta do it (you gotta do it)
You gotta do it your way

You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it (do it)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (prove it)
You gotta mean what you say

Lifeâs a party, make it hot
Dance donât ever stop, whatever rhythm
Every minute, every day
Take them all the way you gotta live âem (âcause Iâm going to live my life)
You gotta do it (you gotta do it)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (you gotta prove it)
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it (do it)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (prove it)
You gotta mean what you say

Chorus:
Letâs get loud, letâs get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Letâs get loud, letâs get loud
Ainât nobody gotta tell you
What you gotta do, oh no

Letâs get loud, letâs get loud
Letâs get loud, letsâget loud
Itâs just a party, baby
Letâs get loud, letâs get loud
Letâs get loud, pop it up
(hey! hey!hey! hey!hey! hey!hey! hey!hey! hey!hey! hey!)
Life is meant to be big fun
