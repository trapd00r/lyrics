You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
That day has come and gone
But you're still away from home
I'm walking the floor over you

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying
As my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

Now darling, you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought you would love me
And you always would be mine
You went away and left me here
With troubles on my mind

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying
As my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
