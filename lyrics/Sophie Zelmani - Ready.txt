My new love is you see
Tied to the dock and waits for me
Older than it appears to be
Saving one last trip for me

Roughly treated with a broken pole
For love only it's been sold
Saw the leak under the surface and
Said hold on we will sail again

I'm ready to head off with you

My love just had enough
Only one owner from giving up
But a shipwreck can't in love be done
In summer air and under a drying sun

I'm ready to head off with you

Who knows how long our love will last
I come from a dream and it from the past
Who knows what it will do to me
When ropes are loosed and waters free
