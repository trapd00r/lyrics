He was born in the Heartland
Raised on American Bandstand
Now you'll find him
In the cutout rack
He was serious
As a heart attack

He never knew what hit him
I think I'm gonna dance now

She was an American beauty
The kind you find in the movies
Now cue the sound
And fade to black
She was serious as
A heart attack

She never knew what hit her
I think I'm gonna dance now

Break it down for me, fellas

I went on a seven day bender
The message said
'Return to sender'
It took a long time
To find my way back
I was serious as a heart attack

I never knew what hit me
I think I'm gonna dance now
