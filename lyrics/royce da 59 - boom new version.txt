*ticking sounds*

h!

oom! Boom! Boom!

ick tick tick, yeah! 5'9'' uh...

o...


'm the verbal spit Smith Wesson

 unload with a sick spit that quick wick to split a split-second

omb with a lit wick expression

ou here a tick tick when you testing...

y saliva and spit can split thread into fiber and bits

o trust me, I'm as live as it gets

verybody clamin the best and head the throne

ince B.I.G is gone

f you ask me, they Dead Wrong

y flow is hotter than the flash from the click

hen the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip

ined up in a room full of my dogs

 have you feelin like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs

o come come now

et pissed on, shitted on

ough talk turns into "Can't we all just get along?"

ou get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on

ou probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song

y gun strrr-utters when it speeks to you

tter shit to repeat to you

othing to clip then give a speak you you

e and Premier, we kinda the same in ways

e both speak with our hands in dangerous ways

ap now is a circus of clowns

 whole lot of lip from clicks I'll probably rap circles around

'm the next best to reach you

eak formely known as the best kept secret

 guess that I just leaked it...


horus:

oom!

omebody better duck or run

omebody better (huch up this spot to blow, oh)

oyce 5'9''


'm a motherfuckin star

 don't battle no mo'

 provide the guns clappin around of applause after the show

e can go toe-to-toe cuz ain't callin you hot

teppin around all you punches like "That's all you got?"

veryday I'm meetin somebody and al
