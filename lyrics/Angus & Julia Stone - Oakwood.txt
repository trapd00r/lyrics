Sneak us there in the middle of the night, oh
Sit up on your roof, have some beers beneath the stars, lover
I can see you there holding my hand, girl
Looking in my eyes, oh, giving me the look, lover

Talking 'bout the lovers that we had, oh
Bag them bones, let's forget all about the others
Look so pretty girl, even when you're high
It's funny, all the shit we speak when we close our eyes, baby

Lovers soon to be lovers
Lovers soon to be others
Lovers soon to be lovers

We met on the beat beat only ones alive
Left here to be the only ones to live as lovers
Trying to move slow but we're so liquored up
Rolling with the wind like a dusty old pick up truck

Drinking on the weekend, weekday
Never get a break to say the things I wanna say, lover
Coke binge state that I'm living in, honey
Trying to reach out for a little bit of your money

Lovers soon to be lovers
(Like a shadow in the moonlight)
Lovers soon to be others
Lovers soon to be lovers
(Like a shadow in the moonlight)
