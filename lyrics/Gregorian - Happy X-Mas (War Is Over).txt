And so this is Christmas
And what you have done?
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dearest ones
The old and the young
A very merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is Christmas
For weak and for strong
For rich and for poor ones

The war is so wrong
And so this is Christmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
A war is over!
If you want!
War is over!
Now!
