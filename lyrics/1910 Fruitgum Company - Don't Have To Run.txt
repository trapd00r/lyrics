The train is comin' down the track
It's bringin' my baby back
She been gone so long
But now the train is bringin' her home, oh

Chorus:
Train hurry up
Bring my baby back
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track
Train hurry up
Bring my baby back
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track

There's people all around
I know they can hear my heart pounding
It's like a clickity-clack
My heart is keeping rhythm with the train on the track, oh

[Chorus:]
I remember the love she gave me
She remembers the love I gave her too
And here she comes and it's drivin' me crazy 'cause
We'll do all the things that we used to do. .. Oh, ho

(Train hurry up, bring my baby back
Train hurry up, bring my baby back)

Ho!

The train is pullin' in
I'm gonna be with my girl again
The huffin' puffin' lovin' train
As she pulls into the station
Never leave me again, oh

[Chorus:]
(Oh) Train hurry up
Bring my baby back
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track (here she comes)
Train hurry up
Bring my baby back (it's bringin' her back)
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track (bring her back)

Train hurry up
Bring my baby back (here she comes)
Hallelujah look it's comin' on down the track (bring her back)
Train hurry up
Bring my baby back (here she comes)
Hallelujah look it's comin'on down the track
