[spoken]

It's 50 a.k.a farrari
f 50
break it down
I got alot of loving to do for a dime
And i aint got time to waste
Lets make it

[chorus]
you said you a gansta
But you neva pop nuthin
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin

[verse 1]
You ain'ta friend of mine, (huh)
You ain't a kin of mine, (nah)
What makes you think Ima run up on you wit the nine
We do this all the time
Right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and we go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine
I gotta make her mine
A ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I Crush em' every time
*Punch 'em wit every line*
I'M fuckin wit they mind
I make em' press rewind
They know they can't shine if i'm around the rhyme
land on paroza's 94 cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it 3 to 9
The D's ran up in my crib
You know who droppin dimes

[Chorus 2x]
You said you a gangsta
but you neva pop nothin
You said you a wanksta
and you need to stop frontin
You go to to the dealership
but you neva cop nothin
You been hustling a long time and you ain't got nothin

[Verse 2]
Damn Homie, In highschool you was the man homie
What the fuck happened to you 
i got the sickest vandada when it come to the cheddar
And if you play with my paper, you gonna meet my berreta
Now shorty think Ima sweat her, sippin on a merada
I'm livin once then deta, i know i could do beta
She look good but i know she after my cheddar
She tryna get in my pockets 
Homie and i ain't gonna lett her
Be easy,stop the bullshiting
you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin the same ol' two step
Gorilla unit cause they say we bugged out
cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
Me I'm no mobster
Me I'm no ganster
Me I'm no hitman,me i'm just me,me
Me I'm no actor
But It's me you see on your t.v
cause i hustle baby
This spanish shit is so easy
I'm getting what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, i got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop me heat
Niggas sayin they going murph 50 how
We ridin roung with guns the size of little bow wow
What you know about a.k and a.r's 15
Equipped, with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh

[Chorus 2x]
