I know,
You've fallen again.
The way I fell before.
Cause I'm a bad loser,
When you get your way.

And I know that I'll change.
I'm chained again.
You've lost your way.
There's nothing I want today.

Cause I'm a bad habit.
One you cannot shake.
And I hope that I change.
Don't follow me.
Don't follow me.

So I wont,
let the flowers grow,
Into the deep below.
Oh, would you forget me now?

Still small.
Small voice of calm.
It's the blame into my arms.

Cause I'm a bad habit.
One you cannot shake.
Oh, Mary, mercy!
Would you pray for me?
Would you pray for me?

So I wont,
Let the flowers grow,
Into the deep below.
Oh, would you forget me now?

And if I could,
Make the days of pain.
Wash the stains away.
Oh, would you forget me now?

Ahhhh! [x2]

Cause I made my mistakes.
And I feel something's changed.
And I know what's at stake.
Wash the stains away...

So I wont,
Let the flowers grow,
Into the deep below.
Oh, would you forget me now?

And if I could,
Take the pain away.
Wash the stains away.
Oh, would you forgive me now?

I made my mistakes.
And I feel something's changed.
Wash the stains away.
And I feel quite okay.
