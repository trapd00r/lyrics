Here we go! 

Here I am, my brand new track 
I made it 'cause you want me back 
It's hard for me but it took a while 
Consider It all in a possible style 
I want my raving generation 
Around the world, across the nation 
It?s what I love, for fun, this track 
Put your hands up, Special D Is Back

Bust the metre 
Tease the needle
