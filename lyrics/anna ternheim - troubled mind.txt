( To be gone EP )

Found love, last summer it faded away.
All marks on my body vanished in a day.
Unwanted, late september when you are eager to find.
Wait to last winter, love of any kind.

You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind.

All winter, slept around until my heart fell a sleep.
Never had so much, was afraid to keep. 
First of april, love of your life falls out of the blue.
Falling for a bad joke, you love to be the fool.

You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind.

So find love, for to night for all nights to come.
As long as your with someone and never left alone.
As long as your with someone never left alone.

You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
