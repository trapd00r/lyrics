I'm calling from the diner
The diner on the corner
I ordered two coffees
One is for you
I was hoping you'd join me
'Cause I ain't go no money
And I really miss you
I should mention that too

Yes I know what time it is
In fact, I just checked
I even know the date
And the month
And the year
I know I haven't been sleeping
And when I do
I just dream of you
Dear

I miss watching you
Drool on your pillow
I miss watching you
Pull on your clothes
I miss listening
To you in the bathroom
Flushing the toilet
Blowing your nose

I'm calling from the diner
The diner on the corner
I ordered two coffees
One is for you
The cups are so close
The steam is rising
In one stream
How are you

I think you're the least fucked up
Person I've ever met
And that may be as close to the real thing
As I'm ever gonna get
But my quarter's gonna run out now
Or so I'm told
I guess I'd better go sit down
And wait for you
Till my coffee gets cold
