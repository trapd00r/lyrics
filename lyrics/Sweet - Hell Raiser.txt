Look out!

Momma let me out on a Saturday night
She said: "Now go out and get her, go and hold her tight"
I said: "Now Momma, you don't understand, every time I touch her hand
It's like I'm burning in the fires of Hell
And if I hold it too long, you never can tell
What'll happen to me, wouldn't want you to see"

Look out!
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look out!

She's like a live bombshell, like a flash out of hell
And when she's shaking her, ooh, everyone fell at her feet
And that's neat and she took me completely
By surprise with her ultrasonic eyes
That were flashing like hysterical danger signs
That said beware where you tread or you'll go out of your head

Look out!
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look out!

Hell raiser, hell raiser, hell raiser
Hell raiser, hell raiser, ooh

Now Momma, you don't understand ev'ry time I touch her hand
It's like I'm burning in the fires of hell
And if I hold her too long you never can tell
What'll happen to me wouldn't want you to see

Lookout!
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hell raiser
Hell raiser
Hell raiser
Hell raiser
Ooh, lookout!
