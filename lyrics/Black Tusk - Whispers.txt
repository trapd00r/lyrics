You're never alone
Still you're on your own
You cannot see the light
Although you face the sunThe things you see
Are filtered through belief so strong
Passed on through DNA and society
I could never believe that the veil
I saw just came from my mind
The illusion is goneA swarming pattern of frequencies
Is what this would be?
Without the decoders called the eyes
Bent into shape as thoughts define what you see
Losing its true form to human miseryWait, resist the ones who feed upon your sorrow
Those who whisper lies to bring the veil in sight
Fate is not the guilt and failures of tomorrow
Fixed and carved in stone, there s nothing of the kindYou cannot really see me in this earthly dome
So avoid judging me, stay silent
Keep in mind that all is veiled
Only fragments of your mind
Now change has begunCame from my mind, the illusion is goneA swarming pattern of frequencies
Is what this would be?
Without the decoders called the eyes
Bent into shape as thoughts define what you see
Losing its true form to human miseryWait, resist the ones who feed upon your sorrow
Those who whisper lies to bring the veil in sight
Fate is not the guilt and failures of tomorrow
Fixed and carved in stone
There s nothing of the kind
