[Intro]
Musical Dope
Come here? i know who you are
I heard you were dead
Yessir, church
Live from your screen?
Death is the final stage of your body
The absolute moment
There is no turning  back

[Verse 1: Thes One]
Back from the fuckin’ dead
Our bodies, dead bodies
Underground can’t rest my head
Resurrect ‘em, collect them ashes
That’s just what they said
We in the cloud now streamin’ cities of angels
Double teamin’ these demons
El Niño them acid rain drops
And blow your head with my return
The fans have gone and emptied out the urn
Well your reward is I’m the Lord
Radio rockin’ through your ouija boards
Lock your doors
Resurrected the People want the P and encore
Well you got it. Furthermore
I’m lightly seasoned with that voodoo
C.T.I and the kudu
I walk with that soul strut, carry that golden era
A legend with no credit rap music vetted Yogi Berra
Brother boom I move that rock out in front of the tomb
Floatin’ through a lagoon of purgatorius goons
Tryin’ to make it back because you demand it
I tried to get some rest
But you seance that rad shit
Well, collect your moonlit trinkets
Totems, candles and talismans
The rebirth from the earth
And the dawn of man
Poetry, poetry over rhythm
We give em' oral tradition
Reminiscing of that mota?
Modern day Atahualpa
Thes one that last inca
Sin falta y sin parar
And so far with the star
That continues to shine
Up from afar up in the sky
Constellation Mike and Chris
Never die regenesis about the chrysalis
I feel like fuckin’ Sisyphus

[Hook]
We back from the dead
I said we back from the dead
You know we back from the dead
I guess we back from the dead
We back from the dead

[Verse 2: Double K]
Poor sucker thought they had the brother under
But I’m harder than a snare, no intensive care
Brought the other side, let me show you what it look like
He was comin’ home late night probably on his dirt bike
But I was chillin, livin’ ghetto lavish
Joints was passin’ good music we laughin’
Then bang, I woke up with a sheet of fresh rhymes
Gin and lime, never committed a crime
Except, me and the homie still active
Attractin’ danger, attractive, movin’ through traffic
When you see us in the rehearse
Your mind reverse, pay attention to the verse
I’m a b-boy and we don’t die
Some join the military and some smoke fry
But the P, we arise
Cremation of character
The spirit we’re scarin’ ya
I’m back on my mic right
Writin’ my name
It’s lame in the same game
Blue and blue, blue and black, yo it's the same thing
I rock with my nigga [?] and he don’t trip
Thes One on the bullshit? Nah, he don’t trip
Mike T, I got some pizza and that part 2 shit
Who want a fat lip speakin’ on that holy ghost
You heard what I said, Thes and Double, we back from the dead
You heard what I said, Thes and Double, we back from the dead

[Hook]
We back from the dead
I said we back from the dead
You know we back from the dead
I guess we back from the dead
We back from the dead
