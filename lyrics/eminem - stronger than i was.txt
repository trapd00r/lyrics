You used to say, that I'd never be
Nothing without you and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby hold me please

And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby please don't leave
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me

And you must hate me, why do you date me
If you say I make you sick
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

But you won't break me, you'll just make me
Stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just
Fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
But I'mma still be humble, when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you had
'Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold, me please

And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby please don't leave
'Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me

So please don't wake me from this dream baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me, you'll just make me
Stronger than I was
Before I let you, I bet you I'll be just
Fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh

We were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die

'Cause if you could've, took my life you would've
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
No one could hurt me like you coulda

Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that, bite me bitch chew on a 19 footer
'Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And a life we coulda

Had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit

I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
I'm done being your punching bag

It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calendar, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay

And I thank you, 'cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, 'cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none

But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah I may be
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me, you'll just make me
Stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just
Fine without you

And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'ma still be humble when I scream, "Fuck you"
'Cause I'm stronger than I was
