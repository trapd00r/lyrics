place a small bet
I lose with no regret and close the door
I light a cigarette
I bite the bullet to taste the war
I'm all used up
Though I've got gas to burn

Another cigarette
I down the whiskey and get one more
Outside the sunset
I see the silhouettes and silently adore
For the first time
Since my return

I'm free, free from the chains now
There's hope, will, strength, direction
Now I can live without you, without you
Now I can live

It's been a long ride
It took a long time, been down on all fours 
I've been to blue eyed
I've tried to hide nevermore
Lord, have mercy for me to learn

I'm free, free from the chains now...
