Find a love
Go build a cabin
Find land and a tree
Carve in a wish
On your knees, planting seeds
The dirt, makin' rows, where the devil don't see

My love, I agree, so lucky to find ya
But memories, they don't stay behind us
Our minds are strong, could it be enough
To bring strength to the bones

Our weeping willow is hangin' above me
On my back in the sun, would it fall upon me
I won't let you down and man you will keep safe my love

Sow the earth
A blanket of bounty
In the distance a hearse
The devil drives empty
In a babies eyes
The ritual purifies every design

Our weeping willow is hangin' above me
On my back in the sun, would it fall upon me
I won't let you down cause man you have kept safe my love
Man you will keep safe my love

Our weeping willow is hangin' above me
On my back in the sun, when you lay beside me
Let you down and man you will keep safe
Let you down, man you will keep safe
Let you down and man you will keep safe my love
