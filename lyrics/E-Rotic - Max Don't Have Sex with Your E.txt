Oh, Max,
Don't have sex

Well, I'm Max, I'm Max,
Baby, call me Max
I'm in love with you and I'll show my ex
Well, I'm Max, Max,
Call me Max
I'm thinking what I'm giving,
I'm giving what it takes
Max, Max, Max,
I'm in love with you and I love my ex
I love you both, and to be true
I don't know what I'm gonna do

I gotta warn you,
Max, don't have sex with your ex
It will make your life complex,
My Max, baby, take it easy
Max, don't have sex with your ex
It will knock you off your legs
Oh, Max, stay cool and just relax

Well I'm Max, I'm Max,
Baby, call me Max
I'm in love with you and I love my ex
Well, I'm Max, Max, call me Max
Cause you love having fun, love having sex
I'm Max, Max, Max,
I'm in love with you and I love my ex
I don't wanna make you feel so blue
I don't know what I'm gonna do

[chorus]

I gotta warn you,
Don't have sex with your ex, Max
Ahhh, ahhh

Oh Max,
Oh sex, Max
Oh Max,
Ahhh
