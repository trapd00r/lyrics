(Canibus)
Why you got so much hatred?
Why don't you want me to make it?
What are you afraid of?
You treat me like I'm not a member of the rap game club
Yo, I sold a million records too, I don't get the same love
It's strange because
The majors already drained my pockets and now they want to drain my blood
Do you have any idea of what I did to get here?
Do you? You can smell the hatred in the atmosphere
This record is proof that I made it
'Cause you're listening to it right now and it's on an independent label
You like Canibus? Yeah right, if you say so
Talk to Louis Lombard he'll put you on the payroll
When you see me on the street now I probably really glow
Nothing like some of these wack rappers that are really broke
I can laugh at a meaningless joke
But I got a daughter to feed, don't hate me 'cause I'm competing bro'
I'm doing it all by myself
And as long as I'm on the shelf I'ma always have wealth
This is what motivated microphone fiends do
And it's okay if you hate me 'cause I hate you too

Is the reason why you keep calling my name out of the blue,
If it's because you hate me, then I hate you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you hate me, I'll say I hate you too

Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hating on us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hating on us!

I hate your style, when I see you I wanna earl
I should do something real foul, like get at your girl
Make your heart throb, take a hooptie and smash your parked car
Run up in your favourite night club, get you barred (Fuck outta here!)
Why you like to hate stars? Why you talking in riddles?
Me losing is the only way to get you to giggle
You pitiful motherfucker, you gon' stay in the gutter
I can see you at 33 and still be living with your mother
I'm sick of you clowns running around, hating on Rippers
You see me in the street, act like your mouth got a zipper
Aiyo don't say a word faggot 'cause it's already proven
Keep it moving, you ain't fucking up this new shit I'm doin'
I'm trying to keep a space between me and you, like gapped teeth
To avoid catching cases for letting the gat speak
I ain't never got a problem to meet on a backstreet
In a black hoodie, new mac-milli, now act silly
You can hate me forever, I'ma always be making moves
Don't be mad 'cause I'm a leader, a Ripper that breaks rules
It's a shame what hate's making individuals do
Don't forget the bottom line is that I hate you too

Is the reason why you keep calling my name out of the blue,
If it's because you hate me, then I hate you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you hate me, I'll say I hate you too

Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hating on us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hating on us!
