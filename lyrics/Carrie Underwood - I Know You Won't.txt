I know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
We belong

Lately, you make me feel all I am is a backup plan
I'll say I'm done and then you smile at me and I'll forget
Everything I said...

I buy into those eyes and into your lies

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.

I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
Still no sound

Of footsteps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.

You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
