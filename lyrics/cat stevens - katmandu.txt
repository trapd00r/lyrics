I sit beside the dark - beneath the mire
cold grey dusty day - the morning lake drinks up the sky
Kathmandu, I'll soon be seeing you
and your strange - bewildering time will hold me down.

Chop me some broken wood - we'll start a fire
white warm, light the dawn and help me see, old Satan's tree
Kathmandu, I'll soon be touching you
and your strange - bewildering time will hold me down

Pass me my hat and coat - lock up the cabin
slow night treat me right until I go - be nice to know
Kathmandu, I'll soon be seeing you
and your strange bewildering time will keep me home
