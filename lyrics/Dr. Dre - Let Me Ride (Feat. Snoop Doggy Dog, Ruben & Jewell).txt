Longtime mi watch ya mi wha chat to ya
And ya a gwaan like ya nuh wha chat to me
So whappn Dre tell 'em whe di fuck a gwaan nuh

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Creepin' down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked 'cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a Tec-9, tryin' to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call, my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off, motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rollin' in my '4 with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Cockin' all the riches, got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by 'cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E from the C-P-T
On a ryhmin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, 'cause if it don't stop, I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another stop 'cause I'm
(Rollin' in my '64) with all the niggas saying

George Clinton and Dr. Dre:
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With all the niggas sayin')
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare with gangsta raps
That gangsta shit makes a gang of snaps
Word to the motherfuckin' streets
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit ya with, that I get ya with
As I groove in my '4 on D's, hittin' the switches
Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin, and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like Indonesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick 'cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip, a nigga trip to the south side, yeah
(Rollin' in my '64) with all the bitches sayin'

George Clinton and Dr. Dre:
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin')
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Check this out, the sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin'
Checkin' my rearview 'cause niggas they will do
Jack moves, black fools 'cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 211
Fuck around and get caught up in a 187
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynchin' but I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street
"Is it Dre? Is it Dre?" that's what they say
Every single motherfuckin' day
Yo, but I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it
While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin', I be
(Rollin' in my '64) with everybody sayin'

George Clinton and Dr. Dre:
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With everybody sayin')
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride

George Clinton:
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride
