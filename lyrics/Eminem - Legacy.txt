Polina:
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

Eminem:
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world that’s why I'm scoffing

At authority, defiant often, flying off at
The handle at my mom, no dad, So I’m non-com-
-pliant at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
And I don’t need no goddamn psychologist

Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself

Either that or inside hiding off in
The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker 'cause he said that I eyeballed him

Polina:
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

Eminem:
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything, in my mind small shit

Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit I'm fine long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side, at least I ain't walking

I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts
That I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try an' start shit

But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin' they're kinda giving me confidence

Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to that kid that said that I eyeballed him

Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

Polina:
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

Eminem:
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords

And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you whack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit

Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walking
Me against the world so what, I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions' offense

So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks butt-kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon' die a ball-licker

I've been diabolical with this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage

The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the fire marshal and

Polina:
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
