Some friends of mine and me stayed up 
All through the night 
Rockin' pretty steady 'til the sky went light 
And didn't go to bed 
Didn't go to work 
I picked up the telephone 
Told the boss he was a jerk 
Your mama don't like when you run around with me 
But we got to hip your mama 
That you got to live free 
Don't need her don't need school 
You don't like your daddy and you don't like rules so 

C'mon baby let's go 
Don't you hear the rock 'n' roll playin' on the radio 
Sounds so right 
Girl you better grab hold 
Everybody's got to know 
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine 
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine 

Oh o-oh oh my little baby 
I'm a little bit shakin' 
I'm a little bit crazy 
But I know what I want 
I want it right now 
While the 'lectric guitars are playing way up loud 

C'mon baby let's go 
Don't you hear the rock 'n' roll playin' on the radio 
Sounds so right 
Girl you better grab hold 
Everybody's got to know 
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine 
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine
