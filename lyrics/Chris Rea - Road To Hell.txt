The road to hell (part 2)

Well Iâm standing by a river
But the water doesnât flow
It boils with every poison you can think of
And Iâm underneath the streetlight
But the light of joy I know
Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows
And the perverted fear of violence
Chokes the smile on every face
And common sense is ringing out the bellc
This ainât no technological breakdown
Oh no, this is the road to hell

And all the roads jam up with credit
And thereâs nothing you can do
Itâs all just bits of paper flying away from you
Oh look out world, take a good look
What comes down here
You must learn this lesson fast and learn it well
This ainât no upwardly mobile freeway
Oh no, this is the road
Said this is the road
This is the road to hell
