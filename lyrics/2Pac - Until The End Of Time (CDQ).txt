Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from tha same places
Tha money and tha fame made us all change places
Could it be through tha misery
That came to past,
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, 
for currency, 
but u could run to me when u need me, 
I'll never leave honestly someone to believe in as u can see.
It's a small thang through and true
What can I do real homies help you get through
And comin' new he'd do tha same thang if he could
Cuz in tha hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be tha same
Until the end of time

Chorus:

So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come & heal me once again,
(Until The End Of Time)
So I can fly , until the end of time
(Until The End Of Time, Until The End Of Time)

Verse Two

Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watchin' tha whole world move in slow mo
For quiet times I disappear and listen to tha ocean
Smokin' pots think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phoney homie had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister had her mumble like like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' tha only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until tha end of time

Chorus:

So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come & heal me once again,
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly , until the end of time

take these Broken Wings,
you've got to learn to fly, n learn to live so free
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly, until the end of time
(Time, Until The End Of Time)

Verse Three:

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life,
As an Outlaw all alone
Remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinkin' henessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin' me to keep tha peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a G
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and tha trainin' to make a G'
Remember me?
As an Outcast Outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about - more, 
gettin' raw 'till tha day I see my casket
Buried as a G' while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

Chorus:
So take, these Broken Wings
(So take, these Broken Wings)
I need your hands to come & heal me once again, (once again, once again)
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly , until the end of time

take these broken wings,
you'v got to learn to learn to fly n learn to live so free
so we can fly, until the end of time

RL:
If the angels come down
and takes me away
Memories of Me and my songs will always stay
Until The End Of Time
