We live today
Bring back all the good times
Lead me to the place where I belong
It's here to stay
Can you see the good times
Discover me
I know it makes me strong

One, two, three, get it

Bring back the good times
Bring back the good feeling
Bring back the happiness
And we bring it back

We live today
Bring back all the good times
Lead me to the place where I belong
It's here to stay
Can you see the good times
Discover me
I know it makes me strong
(Bring it back back back back..)

One, two, three, get it
