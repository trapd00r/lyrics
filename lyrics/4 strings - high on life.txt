Every time I close my eyes, I see it.
The way you occupy my mind. I need it
Got addicted to that smile, I feel it.
You got to know what's on my mind, read it.

I feel so high, high on life
I see heaven in your eyes
High on life
Don't you waste your time

Wherever you go, I'll be there.
You know you can't hide from me
I was the one you needed
To feel so high on life, so free.

I feel so high, high on life
I see heaven in your eyes,
I feel so high
Read it in my eyes.

Every promise that we make, keep it
All the love I really need, you give it.

I feel so high, high on life.
High on life
I feel so high, high on life
I see heaven in your eyes
I feel so high on life
Don't you waste your time.
