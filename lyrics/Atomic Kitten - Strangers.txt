Liz:
Everything you do
Says that you are leaving me
Everything you say
Shows you don't believe in me
How was I supposed to know,
This was gonna hurt us so?
You and I are strangers in our home
You and I are strangers in our home

Everything I feel
Proves there's nothing left in me
Everything I hear
Takes away the breath in me
How was I supposed to know,
This was gonna hurt us so?
You and I are strangers in our home
You and I are strangers in our home

How was I supposed to know,
This was gonna hurt us so?
This was gonna hurt us so
You and I are strangers in our home
You and I are strangers in our home
You and I are strangers in our home
You and I are strangers in our home
