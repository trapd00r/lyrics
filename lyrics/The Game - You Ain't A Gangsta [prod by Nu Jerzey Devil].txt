(Demon Voice) 
Nu Jersey Devil 

(the game) 
Yeah muthafuckers 
It's the muthafuckin Game 
gu, gu,...gu,gu,gu,gu, G-Unit 

I got a hundred guns and a hundred clips 
Nigga I'm in New York (New York) 
Wit a hundred Bloods and a hundred Crips, 
Whenever I'm in New York (New York) 
I got a hundred guns and a hundred clips Nigga, I'm in New York (New York) 
Ride wit a hundred Bloods and a hundred Crips 
Whenever I'm in New York (New York) 

Everybody wanna know why he got beef 
'Cause in my dreams I talked to 'Pac and B.I.G. 
Got on the plane hopin that the NYC 
It's me behind these bars like Chi-Ali 
Niggaz want me to D-i-e 
Been there, done that 
Woke up from a coma on 3 I.V's 
Eyes on the thrown, somebody in my seat 
Fiddlin with rap like Miri Ben-ari 
I scoop up swiss(beats), drive thru the Bronx and get Jada on the phone 
My next stop is Yonkers 
After that its Harlem, why? 
'Cause im a certified gangsta 
And Jim Jones' throwin a Blood party 
Red bandanas from 93rd to 115th and Lennox 
It's the sequel to Menace 
Oh Lord, he done went o dogg 
Made 50's beef his and knocked 'em both off 

[Chorus] 


New aftermath chain on, thats the bling 
Stones yellow and black - he a Latin King 
Mira me king ton el jefe Simone 
Translation: I get money off ringtones 
King Blood, even though I used to sling drugs when i see snoop he tell me "Keep doin your thing cuz" 
I do it cause I love it 
Do it for the niggaz that don't know the difference between 'Chuck Taylors' and chuckers 
I'm a gangsta tell Remi Martin I wanna fuck her 
Thats what I call a championship game at the Rucker 
ya'll want beef? change the subject 
You ain't got no stars like the flag of the Dominican Republic 
After Angie's show I was finna to get the bus
And catch a cab to a house and ask any nigga hustlin 
I ain't got to live in New York all my life to know the A and D train go to Washington Heights 

[Chorus] 

Left the VMA awards, went back to the hood 
Streets is talkin - 'Game got slapped by Suge'
False, I was face to face wit him 
Media wanna criticize the game 
Like he had Ma wit him 
He a hood nigga that ain't ever try to snake niggaz 
Walk thru the 5 boroughs never had jake with him 
Bake it how u want, ain't no cupcake in him 
Even Diddy know, I make the city glow 
Never had an album, never had his own video 
I was sellin crack while Ja was watchin 50 blow 
White tee shirt, converse and my dickies on 
Signed wit Dre recorded 150 songs 
Now the fuckin hip hop police hatin 
tryin to run me outta New York like Anthony Mason 
Nigga I'll come and erase you 
Only nigga from california 
That'll come from the tongue wit a razor 

[Chorus]
