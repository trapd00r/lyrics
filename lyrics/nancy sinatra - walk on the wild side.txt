Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

Tell me I'm great and I'll be greater
Build me up and I'll fly
Love me now and I'll be glad later
And tell your trouble bye-bye

Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

Spill that cup of trouble and sorrow
The sooner the better for you, yeah
Fill it up with a happy tomorrow
We got some living to do

Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

Well, cuddle me up and I'll squeeze tighter
Honey let's kiss me do
A good, good loving makes a bad, bad fighter
And I'm not picking on you

Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me

Lay some happiness on me
So the brighter side you'll see, yeah
No more loneliness to me
Lay some happiness on me, on me
