I have not quite thrown
Enough of me away
I have tried to rip the rest of me apart
But still a little bit remains

Please don’t hold me too tightly by the reins
I will crumble to a powder
I will shatter and be swiftly swept away

I do still want for you to love me
I just don’t know who I am
But I know that who I’m not is who I’ve been
And I will never be again

Please don’t hold me too tightly by the reins
Or I will kick and I will buck
And I will run right out the nearest open gate

I may just graze until I’m lonesome
I might just run right back again
With my tail between my legs
And with a look that begs you baby to forgive

But if you hold me too tightly by the reins
I will crumble to a powder
I will shatter and be swiftly swept away

I do still want for you to love me
I just don’t know who I am
But I know that who I’m not is who I’ve been
And I will never be again

Please don’t hold me too tightly by the reins
Or I will kick and I will buck
And I will run right out the nearest open gate
