butch cassidy i could've been your friend,
and rode with you and the sundance kid.
we'd laugh awhile and we'd smile a bit,
cause crimes like our arent counterfit.
they say you never even killed a man,
till it came right down to your final stand.
bullets flyin and the wounded cryin
and your buddy he's goin down.
get lower and the feelins show
and you gave off the final sound.
cause a soldiers death is so much better than defeat just hangin around.
defeat just hangin around.
