Party waste, found the base
Had a taste, Daryl gates is breaking through
Stole my car, in my drawer, stole my bucks
Really sucks, I can't trust you
Candle light, door shut tight, gonna fight
Losers here are so uncool
Brought me here, took my cash, get away
Take me for a fool

Rock house is destroying you
Low life's smoking kools
Locked door are the rule
Ramdoors breaking through

Zombie girls drooping eyes
Can't get enough, one more puff
We're not through
Dealer says give 'em head
He's got something that will make you really smooth
Legs are spread, mouths are open
Most of them are hoping that it might be you
Spent the cash, make a dash
Keep inhaling till your face is turning blue

Rock house is destroying you
Low life's smoking kools
Locked door are the rule
Ramdoors breaking through
