I'm off this drank, movin' slow right now
I don't know where I'ma go right now
I ain't answering my phone right now
I ain't by myself but feel alone right now
And I did it on my own just like how
If I get her in the room, it's light's out
And I know these niggas hold they life off
But I ain't worried 'bout nobody, 'cause I ball
Yeah yeah, I ball

Rastar, on some star shit
I'ma jump off the stage, I'ma start a moshpit
Yeah, we goin' out to eat, I'ma do the pasta
And my shawty loves her eat, said she wants some lobster
Oh, she stop, go
If a bitch test me, she fucked up
Come and get your thot, yeah
Say she wanna fuck me, told her, "Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah"
Yeah, big bankroll in my pocket
Remember last year I couldn't cop it? I copped it, yeah
Say you fuck with me, you should stop it
I been rollin' 'round in my rocket, rocket, yeah
I be outer space, astronaut shit
Run up to their space, I might go to the tropics, yeah
And I need my space, we are not friends
I stay out the way 'cause I know these niggas plottin', yeah
I think I want a 'Rari and an Aston
And I think that mommy want a mansion
Diamonds in my mouth so I'm laughing
You can live like me, just imagine

I'm off this drank, movin' slow right now
I don't know where I'ma go right now
I ain't answering my phone right now
I ain't by myself but feel alone right now
I'm off this drank, movin' slow right now
I don't know where I'ma go right now
I ain't answering my phone right now
I ain't by myself but feel alone right now
