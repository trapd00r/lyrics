I'm dancing under the moon above
And I'm singing my favorite song of love
I'm raving on a memory
And I'm living in my fantasy with you

I'm dancing under the moon above
And I'm singing my favorite song of love
I'm raving on a memory
And I'm living in my fantasy with you

Laying in the grass I watch the sky
See the clouds and the birds passing by
And together with my dreams they drift away
To a fantasy world miles away from you

And I'm dancing and I'm raving
Yes, I feel it, now I'm shaking
And I'm dancing and I'm raving
Yes, I feel it, now I'm shaking

And I'm dancing and I'm raving
Yes, I feel it, now I'm shaking
And I'm dancing and I'm raving
Yes, I feel it, now I'm shaking

I'm dancing under the moon above
And I'm singing my favorite song of love
I'm raving on a memory
And I'm living in my fantasy with you

Laying in the grass I watch the sky
See the clouds and the birds passing by
And together with my dreams they drift away
To a fantasy world (Fantasy world)

I'm dancing under the moon above
I'm raving on a memory

I'm dancing under the moon above
And I'm singing my favorite song of love
I'm raving on a memory
And I'm living in my fantasy with you

Laying in the grass I watch the sky
See the clouds and the birds passing by
And together with my dreams they drift away
To a fantasy world (Fantasy world)

I'm dancing under the moon above
And I'm singing my favorite song of love
I'm raving on a memory
And I'm living in my fantasy with you

Laying in the grass I watch the sky
See the clouds and the birds passing by
And together with my dreams they drift away
To a fantasy world (Fantasy world)
