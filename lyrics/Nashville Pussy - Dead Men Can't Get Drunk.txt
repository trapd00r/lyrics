How long can I drag this thing on
It feels like someone pissed inside my soul
Spent my life perfecting desperation
Never gave a damn about self control
And if the bottom dropped out of hell
I'd be too low down to even tell
Gotta keep on living cause
Dead man can't get drunk
No can't get drunk

Singing songs about the good old crucifixion
They never said don't try this at home
Endless anthem of self mass destruction
Gotta keep on living cause
Dead man can't get drunk
No can't get drunk

How long can I drag this thing on
It feels like someone pissed inside my soul
Endless anthem of self mass destruction
Well I know hits ready to go
And if the bottom dropped out of hell
I'd be too low down to even tell
Gotta keep on living cause
Dead man can't get drunk
No can't get drunk No

So nail me up
The best you can
Just put a cold one
In my hand
