Headed back down South
Gonna see my daddy's mistress
Gonna buy back her forgivness
Pay off every witness

One more time down South 
Sell the family headstones
Drag a bag of dry bones
Make good on my back loans

So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have and a little more

Sleep late down South
Look up my former mentors
Live off yankee winters
Be a landlord and a renter

Create myself down South
Impress all the women 
Pretend I'm Samuel Clemens
Wear seersucker and white linens

So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have and a little more

Spanish moss down South
Find the heroes of my childhood
Who now can do me no good
Carve their names in dogwood

Chasin' ghosts down South
Spirits cross the dead fields
Mosquitoes hit the windshield
All document remain sealed

So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have and a little more
I'll give you all I have and a little more
