c'mon yeah yeah

(vers 1)
you've been talkin in your sleep and you've raised my curiosity
you've been calling out a name let me down in your senserity 
so why'd you play theese games with me why'd you let me down when
all I ask is understand from you
Gonna take no more of your..

(Chorus)
Infidelity why do you do those things to me
Infidelity I need to find myself another love I've had enough of
Infidelity eyeah

(vers2)

I just have to realize that I'm not your first priority 
I don't need to live a lie full of lies and promiscuity
So now It's time to take a stand time to take control
Cause I don't wan't no second hand affair
Now that I'm aware of your

(Chorus)
Infidelity Why do you do those things to me
Infidelity I need to find myself another love I've had enough of
Infidelity.. I need to find i need to find..

Infydelity Why do you do those things to me
Infidelity I need to find myself another love I've had enough of 
Infidelity...I need to find I need to find..

(Stick)
now I'm gonna leave it all behind
gonna think about myself this time
There's no chance I give it one more try 
There's no chance to give it one more lie 
I won't wait for you to play your game
I won't wait for you to try again 
Now i now what I'm supposed to do.
Live my life without you

Now It's time to take a stand time to take control
Cause i don't wan't no second hand affair
Now that I'm aware of your

(Chorus)
Infidelity Why do you do those things to me
Infidelity I need to find myself another love I've had enough of
Infidelity.. I need to find  (i need to find.).

Infidelity Why do you do those things to me
Infidelity I need to find myself another love I've had enough of 
Infidelity...
yeah yeah
