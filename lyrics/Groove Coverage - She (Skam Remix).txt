La, na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na (Repeat)

She hangs out every day near by the beach
Havin' a Heineken fallin' asleep
She looks so s__y when she's walking the sand
Nobody ever put a ring on her hand

Swim to the oceanshore fish in the sea
She is the story the story is she
She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why

[Chorus]
She is the one that you never forget
She is the heaven-sent angel you met
Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
She is so pretty all over the world

She puts the rhythm, the beat in the drum
She comes in the morning, in the evening she's gone
Every little hour every second you live
Trust in eternity that's what she gives

She looks like Marilyn, walks like Suzanne
She talks like Monica and Marianne
She wins in everything that she might do
And she will respect you forever just you

[Chorus]
She is the one that you never forget
She is the heaven-sent angel you met
Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
She is so pretty all over the world

She is so pretty all over the world
She is so pretty
She is like you and me
Like them like we
She is in you and me

[Chorus]
She is the one that you never forget
She is the heaven-sent angel you met
Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
She is so pretty all over the world

Na na na na na ....
