Sovay, Sovay all on a day
She dressed herself in man's array
With a brace of pistols all at her side
To meet her true love, to meet her true love, away she rides

As she was galloping on the plain
She met her true love and bid him stand
Stand and deliver, young man, she said
And if you do not, and if you do not, I'll shoot you dead'

He delivered up his golden store
And still she craved for one thing more
That diamond ring, that I see you wear
Oh hand it over, oh hand it over, and your life I'll spare

From my diamond ring I would not part
For it's a token from my sweetheart
You shoot and be damned you rogue said he
And you'll be hanged then and you'll be hanged then for murdering me

Next morning in the garden green
Young Sovay and her true love were seen
He spied his watch hanging from her clothes
Which made him blush lads, which made him blush lads like any rose

Why do you blush you silly young thing
I thought to have that diamond ring
Twas I who robbed you all on the plain
So here's your gold love, so here's your gold and your watch and chain

I only did it for to know
If you would be a man or no
If you had given me that ring she said
I'd have pulled the trigger I'd pulled the trigger and shot you dead
