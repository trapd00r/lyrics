Ay, this shit not to be played with around here
Come through here your ass will get it
My nigga, I've been waiting to holla at you my nigga
This shit crazy out here boy, don't nobody got nothing out here boy
Yeah nigga, I'm telling you nigga, you the hood billionaire nigga
I'm talking about you boy, this shit where they believe in my nigga

Uh, I'm your neighborhood drug dealer
It's your neighborhood drug dealer
Uh, it's your neighborhood drug dealer

Neighborhood drug dealer

One, two, what it be?
Michael Jordan, white, bitch, 23

Bet you hear my pipes rev when I tip the scale
Rich forever, still a muscle and it never fails
You a house nigga so they let you get the mail
We in the back whippin' egg whites and crackin' shells
Robin jeans for my team, pocket for the sale
Pussy niggas gossip pray you die from gonorrhea
Al Capone where I'm from that Benzo bullet proof
Neighborhood dope boy you can get it too
Fuck them pussy niggas catch they ass at Smoothie Kings
Hundred missed calls after that new toolie rings
Skip South Beach bitch bring it to the ridge
For that change, put that thing right up to your ribs

Chevy SS, she heard I bump fire
Got row houses up and down through Pembroke Pines
Say the streets count, I say its bout time
Bail [?] on my mama been about mine
Still pay my child support, in all trap money
All 5's and 10's, can't touch my rap money
She won't fuck with me, I'm hatin', yeah I'm pussy stank
Meet your amigo mama then you crack the piggie bank
Dope boy dream, never lose it all
Montgomery Alabama know we love the send 'em soft
Baton Rouge's a Actavis and act a fool
Neighborhood dope boy you should hit me too
