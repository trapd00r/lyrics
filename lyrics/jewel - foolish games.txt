You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You were always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside, looking in on you

You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart, bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you, you loved Mozart 
And you'd speak of your loved ones as I clumsily strummed my guitar

Teach me of honest things, things that were daring 
Things that were clean, things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you

Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself
And these foolish games are tearing me, you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You took your coat off, stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
