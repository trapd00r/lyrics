There is some kind of mystery
In this land we live
A thousand years in our history
Taught us to believe

We never know
What the future has in store
'Till the end of time
We are all

Ready to die, never give up the fight
Leading our nation into the light
Ready to fall in this battle we call
Live forevermore

In spite of many dangers and
Destructions of war
In this land, wherever we stand
Everything is gold

We never know
What is in the crystal ball
While we are alive
We are all

Ready to die, never give up the fight
Leading our nation into the light
Ready to fall in this battle we call
Live forevermore

Ready to die, never give up the fight
Leading our nation into the light
Ready to fall in this battle we call
Live forevermore

----

Ready to die, never give up the fight
Leading our nation into the light
Ready to fall in this battle we call
Live forevermore

Ready to die, never give up the fight
Leading our nation into the light
Ready to fall in this battle we call
Live forevermore
