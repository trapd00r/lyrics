Mortal fear, tyranny
Of light and love
Mind control in the name
Of the gods above
In torment and pain
The end is drawing near
Send me an angel
To safe me from here

Fire is falling from the sky
The storm is raging
The gods have turned away
Prepare to die

Our time has come
This is the end of all
No prayers and no sacrifice
Will safe us from demise
Our time has come
Farewell forevermore
And may the world be a brighter place
Another chance for the human race

A man in black - a silent shadow
The hand of the crown
Demonic whisper - seducing tongue
Always around
A dark alliance of boundless power
To strike and to kill
To rule the land - destroy the foe
With iron hand

Fire is falling from the sky
The storm is raging
The gods have turned away
Prepare to die

Our time has come
This is the end of all
No prayers and no sacrifice
Will safe us from demise
Our time has come
Farewell forevermore
And may the world be a brighter place
Another chance for the human race

Our time has come
This is the end of all
No prayers and no sacrifice
Will safe us from demise
Our time has come
Farewell forevermore
And may the world be a brighter place
Another chance for the human race
