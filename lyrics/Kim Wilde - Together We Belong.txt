When our days are so low down
The grass and sky all coloured brown
And nothing but the bad news haunts our minds
We look at life through different eyes
But soon begin to realise
That this is just a day we'll leave behind
We know and we both understand
We hold the fire in our hands
But every fire's bound to have its sparks

Together we belong
Together we are strong enough
For the days I have with you
All the happy and the sad
And all the ways I drive you mad
In the days I have with you
The silent anger when we fight
The way the words don't come out right
The way we hold on so strong in the night
It always ends up right with you

We're running faster every day
Sometimes we don't make time to say
The words we both are feeling in our hearts
As life's distractions fill our minds
Our precious gift gets left behind
With both of us left wondering where to start
We know and we both understand
We hold the fire in our hands
But every fire's bound to have its sparks

Together we belong
Together we are strong enough
For the days I have with you
All the happy and the sad
And all the ways I drive you mad
In the days I have with you
The silent anger when we fight
The way the words don't come out right
The way we hold on so strong in the night
It always ends up right with you

Never a day goes by
It's you that I need
Never a moment when I don't believe
I'll spend my life through with you 
Never a day

Together we belong
Together we are strong enough
For the days I have with you
All the happy and the sad
And all the ways I drive you mad
In the days I have with you
The silent anger when we fight
The way the words don't come out right
The way we hold on so strong in the night
It always ends up right with you
