Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit

If I could just put it all into all I spit
Instead of always trying to swallow it
Instead of staring at this wall and shit
While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it shit

All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealing with another fucking politic

I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up

The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well I'm a show you what, you gonna feel my rush
You don't feel it? Then it must be too real to touch

Peel the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah I'm a make your hair sit up
Yeah sit up, I'm a tell you who I be
I'm a make you hate me 'cause you ain't me

You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you close-minded fucks were to blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me

You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line but sometimes
I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feeling at that time
Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, just sometimes
It's always me, how dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3
This half-ass rhyme with this half-ass piece of paper

I'm desperate at my desk, if I could just get the rest
Of this shit off my chest again, stuck in this slump
Can't think of nothing, fuck I'm stumped
Uh, wait, here comes something

Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad
Crinkle it up and throw the shit out
I'm fizzling now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out

I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want

I'm a switch-hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'm a sit here 'til I get enough in me
To finally hit a fucking boiling point
Put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed

An MC's worst dream, I make them tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of them you would swear that Jaws was coming
By the scream of them you would swear I'm sawing someone
By the way they running you would swear the law was coming
It's now or never and tonight it's all or nothing
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest

I be back baby I just got to beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'm a make them eat this watch
Don't believe me watch, I'm a win this race
And I'm a come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch

I found my niche, you gonna hear my voice
'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance I'll grab it, rabbit run
