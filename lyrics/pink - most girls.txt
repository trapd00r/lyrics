I never cared too much for love,
It was all a bunch of mush
That I just did not want.

Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game.
Couldn't be more fly,
Gettin' paid was everything.

But I'm not every girl.
And I don't need that world
To validate me.

'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent.
Don't wanna dance if 
It's not in my heart...

Most girls want a man 
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing, 
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...

Most girls want a man 
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance 
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love.
(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha. Ah... ah..)

Uh...

I was a girl about the floss;
It was all about the cost,
How much he spent on me.

Seek for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings,
It's what every fly girl 
Could want or even dream.

But I'm not every girl, 
And I don't need no G
To take care of me.

'Cause shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent.
Don't wanna dance if 
It's not in my heart.
No, oh.

Most girls want a man 
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing, 
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...

Most girls want a man 
With the mean green,
Don't wanna dance 
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of,
A man that understands real love.

Most girls want a man

Don't wanna dance

Everything that I dream of,

(Uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Yeah...)
(Oh, yeah...)

I'm not every girl,
And I don't need no G
to take care of me, no.

'Cos shorty got a job,
shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent,
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart...

But I'm not every girl, 
And I don't need no G
To take care of me.

No, shorty got a job,
Shorty got a car,
Shorty can pay her own rent,
Don't wanna dance if 
It's not in my heart...
Oh, no.

Most girls want a man 
With the bling-bling,
Got my own thing, 
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...
