I want you to know
That I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both

An older version of me? 
Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently? 
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave
That we made 
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 
'Til you died
But you're still alive

And I'm here 
To remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair 
To deny me
Of the cross I bear - that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

You seem very well
Things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well
I thought you should know

Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face 
How quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

'Cause the love that you gave
That we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 
'Til you died
But you're still alive

And I'm here
To remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair 
To deny me
Of the cross I bear - that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me 
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back 
I hope you feel it 
Oh, can you feel it?

Well, I'm here 
To remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair 
To deny me
Of the cross I bear - that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know why I'm here:
To remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair 
To deny me
Of the cross I bear - that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
