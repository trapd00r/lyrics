We've had some fun, and yes we've had our ups and downs 
Been down that rocky road, but here we are, still around 
We thought about someone else, but neither one took the bait 
We thought about breaking up, but now we know it's much too late 

We are bound by all the rest 
Like the same phone number 
All the same friends 
And the same address

Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you 
Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you 
'Cause I can see, (I can see) that you're happy to be stuck with me

We've had our doubts, we never took them seriously 
And we've had our ins and outs, but that's the way it's supposed to be 
We thought about giving up, but we could never stay away 
Thought about breaking up, but now we know it's much too late 
And it's no great mystery 
If we change our minds 
Eventually, it's back to you and me

Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you 
Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you 
'Cause I can see, (I can see) that you're happy to be stuck with me

We are bound by all the rest 
Like the same phone number 
All the same friends 
And the same address

Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I am happy to be stuck with you 
Yes, it's true, (yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you 
'Cause I can see, (I can see) that you're happy to be stuck with me
(yes it's true) I'm so happy to be stuck with you 
I'm happy to be stuck with you
Happy to be stuck with you.
