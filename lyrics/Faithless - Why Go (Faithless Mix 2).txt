Don't go

I didn't know you'd be here
and I wasn't meant to come
I'd be sitting watching TV
If there was anything decent on

If I'd missed the taxi
Or found nothing good to weare
But for some uncertain reason
Some strange uncertain reason
This is how it all
It all began

Why go?
Why go?
When you could stay a while

If I made some coffe
Would you sit and talk some more?
I know words are uaually pointless
When you've used them all before

The way you smile fills the room
Stay a while kick off your shoes
Don't go
Please stay
It always happens this way

The way you smile fills the room
Stay a while
Whats's there to lose?
Thea way you laugh
When I say
Don't go
Please stay
