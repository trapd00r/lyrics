We must have played for more than ten years
We must have thought that we're immortal
Shame, shame on us, ah, little hussy
What did you think I was?

I look at us, we have grown older
A lot, too much for me to take
I thought we were immortal
I'm so sorry, but I will keep my promise

To carry on your flag for you
Some superhero-being, ah-ha
To carry on your flag for you
Some superhero-being, ah-ha

Whoa
(Whoa)
Ah-ha
Whoa
(Whoa)
Superhero

It seems to me that we are changing
There ain't no limit to imagination
The world just turns around without a care
Sometimes I feel like crying

And every time I need to touch you
How can I ever break the distance?
That's when my love became so strong and pure
That's why I keep on trying forever


To carry on your flag
(Whoa)
To carry on your flag
(Whoa)
To carry on, carry on your flag
For you
Some superhero-being
Waiting under the light of the Moon
I'm coming soon, I'm coming down to you
Waiting under the light of the Moon

(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa) to carry on your flag
(Whoa) to carry on, carry on your flag
(Whoa) to carry on your flag, whoa
(Whoa) some superhero-being
(Whoa) to carry on your flag
(Whoa) some superhero-being
(Whoa) to carry on your flag
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
