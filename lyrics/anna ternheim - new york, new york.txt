Start spreading the news
I’m leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

These little town blues
Are melting away
I’ll make a brand new start of it
New York, New York
Start spreading the news
I’m leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
