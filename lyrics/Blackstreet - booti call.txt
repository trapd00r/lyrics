It's just a bootie call

Hey baby, turn around
It's not what it seems
The way I like it by the pound
Must be in the genes

Only want to have fun
No time to get sprung
That's the way it is on Blackstreet
After all, it's a booty call

Well, you know what I like
You've got it
Just be there tonight
I want it, hey, yeah

You know that it's right
All I wanna do is be
Where you're at

Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

Sometimes I feel that I
Might want to settle down
But on my wedding night I feel
I'm gonna play around

Life is too short to lie
I mean no disrespect at all
But if the other woman's on my mind
On my life, it's a booty call

Well, you know what I like
You've got it
Just be there tonight
I want it

You know that it's right
All I wanna do is be
Where you're at
Why must I feel like that

Bow wow wow
Yippy yo yippee ay, hey

Yo, take it to the limit

Every dog has his day
And I'm digging on the vibes
So we can get together
Make tonight real live

Checking out the front
Checking out the back
Well, I'll be god damned
Is it really like that

Summer's hot
Winter's freezing
Chasing that cat
All through the season
Hey, yo, girl, stop teasing

Check your trips
'Cause I really wanna stroke
You're saying I'll drown
I'm saying you'll choke

Back at my place
Face to face
I'm trying to be good
So we can cut to the chase

You know what I like
And, baby, you got it
Come on, let's get this started

Back on Blackstreet
We can have a ball
Cause after all
It's just a booty call

Well, you know what I like
You've got it
Just be there tonight
I want it

You know that it's right
All I wanna do is be
Where you're at
Why must I feel like that

Bow wow wow
Yippy yo yippee ay, hey
