I'm just another voice from the street
and since it's my choice, I feel that I must speak
now I know that you won't listen to little me
but I can't rest unless I get this off my chest
see--
the city's my home the streets where I roam--but still I leave the drugs and violence alone

And so i try to stay in the right frame of mind
although i know some people who might say that I'm
crazy and lazy for not breakin' out
but the city has soul and that's what I'm about

I have an appetite that must be fed
no longer blind and being led
the of freedom that you can buy
my bank won't lend me yet
but still i can get by--and even smile
so don't judge me by the colour of my skin
my blood runs as deep as your runs red
which takes me out of the rap

Chorus: The choice is mine
with my joy and pain inside
and I ain't gone under yet!

See bodies with souls living in the street
no one wants to live with nothing to eat
but to climb over livign people and fee that they brought in on themselves cause they lazy or would rather steal is a mystery--

so don't judge me by the colour of my skin
my blood runs as deep as your runs red
which takes me out of the verse

Chorus: The choice is mine
with my joy and pain inside
and I ain't gone under yet!

your under is my over i've never seen your over yet
but don't forget
I ain't gone under yet! 4X

I don't steal I don't run tricks or scams
cause I'm a strong young woman yes I know who I am
but sometimes it's so hard to get by
touch circumstatnces make me want to get high
but I don't go too far cause that ain't my style
so why don't you come live next to me for a while.
