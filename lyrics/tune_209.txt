Saw you stretched out in Room Ten O Nine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Oh, couldn't see to get a line on you
My sweet honey love

Berber jew'lry jangling down the street
Make you shut your eyes at every woman that you meet
Couldn't seem to get a high on you
My sweet honey love

May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song (you sing) your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun

When you're drunk in the alley, baby
With your clothes all torn
And your late night friends
Leave you in the cold gray dawn
Just seemed too many flies on you
I just can't brush them off

Angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces
And a gleam right in their eyes
Whoa, thought I heard one sigh for you
Come on up, come on up, now
Come on up, now

May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun

May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
