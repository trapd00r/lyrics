We got it together darlin'
We're ready for it
You see I'm smilin'

We got the peope talkin'
They know how it feels
And it's no big deal

And we're not playin' games
And we're not playin' lovers
We mean a lot more than that

Hear what I'm sayin' boy
Let go and be my joy
I have to love you

You can't deny it baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it baby
No two people ever felt this way
You can't deny it baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it baby
We just got to let it out
Let it out
Let it out
Let it out

The more we're with each other
It's so exciting
And it's getting stronger

The way you touch me darlin'
I've never been touched like that before

And we're not playin' games
And we're not playin' lovers
We mean a lot more than that

You're all I need my love
You're there to push me on
I have to love you

You can't deny it baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it baby
No two people ever felt this way
You can't deny it baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it baby
We just got to let it out
Let it out
Let it out
Let it out

Let it out
Let it out

And we're not playin' games
And we're not playin' lovers
Hear what I'm sayin' boy
Let go and be my joy
I have to love...bop bop

You can't deny it baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it baby
No two people ever felt this way
You can't deny it baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it baby
We just got to let it out
Let it out
Let it out
Let it out
