Starin' through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level
Starin'...

Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
To murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
Crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
Flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again

I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin' with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend

I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview,
See I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview see
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die (we)
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers

(E.D.I.)
Now you see em, now you don't, some niggaz
Be here for the moment, and then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug life until I check out of this bitch, I thought you'd know this
Who is, gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I feel like southpaws
But still we keep mashin till our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview

(Tupac)
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin'
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin' hotter
Cause the world's gettin' colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches

Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I say
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly and all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly nigga can die

(Kadaffi)
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets, somethin' I learned
In school, on some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since the seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
By young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burn my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too while starin' through your rearview

(Tupac)
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin' what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin' at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't

Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time flyand we'll be
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
Heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly, ya know
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you heart beatin' fast... time to die
High, watchin time fly
