[Verse 1]
There's a place I know
There's some people there
That I know are evil
But I just don't care

There's a feeling in me
That I can't control
It's a type of sorrow
That'll hurt my soul

I can be my own
Type of lover man
But I won't go on
Until I understand

I hear the thunderclap!
I hear the wind and rain
It's a rip in space
It's my cold hard shame

Oh doctor, doctor
Please cure what's ailing me
Please give me a perscription
And make my heart free

[Hook]
There's a revolution
There's an execution
There's a resistance
There's a new feeling
Rising up and through my bones

[Verse 2]
There's a place I know!
Where the wind don't blow
There's a place I know
Where you don;t want to go
There's a place i know
Where the evil shows
In the light of day

I hear the sun coming back
I see the moon is off it's track

The stars and heavens
The story leavens
The plot keeps thickening
But the love is quickening

Into sand
Don't you understand
There's a whole
Lot of trouble more

I see a hurracane
I see the wind and rain
I see a shallow figure
And its my cold hard shame

[Hook]
There's a revolution
There's an execution
There's a resistance
There's a new feeling
Rising up and through my bones
