I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love
Be everything that you need

I love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong I will be faithful
'Cause I'm counting on

A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly
In the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to heaven
And make you want to cry

The tears of joy for all the pleasure
And the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort
And protection of

The highest powers
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh can you see it baby?
Don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come, ooh yeah

I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love
Be everything that you need

I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do
Mmm

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna live like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Ooh, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
