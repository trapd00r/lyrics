There's something in your eyes I know I can't resist
Something in the air, I don't know why
You were hardly there when I was on my own
There's something about you that makes me cry

Can I believe that your heart still beats for me?
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny
I wanna know

Give me a reason for me to believe in, can't you see it in my eyes?
That I need a reason, for I'm still breathing. Is it time to say goodbye?
'Cause deep in my heart I know there's a reason why I am not leaving, why I'm not alone. So give me a reason for me to believe in, give me a reason

There's something in your eyes I know I can't resist
Something in the air, I don't know why

Can I believe that your heart still beats for me?
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny
I wanna know

Give me a reason for me to believe in, can't you see it in my eyes?
That I need a reason, for I'm still breathing. Is it time to say goodbye?
'Cause deep in my heart I know there's a reason why I am not leaving, why I'm not alone. So give me a reason for me to believe in, give me a reason
