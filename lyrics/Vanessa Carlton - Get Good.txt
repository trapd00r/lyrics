Are the echoes coming back to you?
Is wisdom seeing patterns on a loom?
Like a blanket around you
You were weaving colors, when I saw you

Put your velvet on the moonlight
Or have you lost your constellation eyes?
Well, you could give it time

And I wish I could be there
Wish I could make it right

And don't you worry, you'll soon be on the mend
That's no trick, that flicker of radiance
And you'll feel lucky, darling, I'm sure of it
You'll figure it out... and get good again

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Stone wall running hills of green
A golden, dusted dandelion scene
A powder soft serene
Oh, it's been so long since powder soft serene
Yeah, it's been so long

But don't you worry, you'll soon be on the mend
That's no trick, that flicker of radiance
You'll feel lucky, darlin', I promise you this
You'll figure it out... and get good again

Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na

You said you don't know why but you don't feel free
You know it's not true but I know what you mean
I want to thank you for being so good to me
I just wanted you to know

Are the echoes coming back to you?
Is wisdom seeing patterns on a loom?
Like a blanket around you
We'll look out for each other
I'll look out for you
We'll look out for each other

Don't you worry, you'll soon be on the mend
That's no trick, that flicker of radiance
You'll feel lucky, darlin', I'm sure of it
You'll figure it out... yeah, we'll get good again

I'll figure it out, and then we'll get good again
I'll figure it out... and get good again

Na na na na na
Na na na na na

In a dream,
A dandelion field in a dream
A dandelion field in a dream
