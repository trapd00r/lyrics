Be there when no one’s around
When you’re in unfamiliar places
Count on me through life’s changes

Everything bout this is real
When you’re in unfamiliar places
Count on me through life’s changes

You’re all I want, yeah yeah
I know you’re the one, yeah
You’re all I want, yeah
I know you’re the one, yeah

Crash into me

We can collide, we can collide

Crash into me
At full speed
We can collide, we can collide
We can collide, we can collide

Crash into me
We can collide, we can collide
We can collide, we can collide

When you’re in unfamiliar places
Count on me through life’s changes

In me you can find a home
When you’re in unfamiliar places
Count on me through life’s changes
