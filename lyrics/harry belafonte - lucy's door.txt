When twilight rivals the closing day
My thoughts go wandering far away,
When I gaze at the skies above
My thoughts return to the one I love
So take me, take me, 'cause I'm feeling lonely
Take me back to Lucy's door
But don't let her mother know

Her mother tell her get steady man
A man of letters from wealthy clan
And when I call at Lucy's door
Her mother tell me "Don't come no more"
So take me, take me, 'cause I'm feeling lonely
Take me back to Lucy's door
But don't let her mother know

But I love the sea and I love the sweat
It's an honest wage an' I have respect
For how much more can there be in life
Than happy children and loving wife
So take me, take me, 'cause I'm feeling lonely
Take me back to Lucy's door
But don't let her mother know
