Screwed up badly the last time
Didn't take the chance to make it right, right, right
Figured there was no next time
cos' I'd been kicking up a storm
I'd been starting up a fight

He said
Oh, Did I ever call you honey
when that name wasn't ment for you

I was standing ready in the front line
where every little sound you make is a lie, lie lie
So hard to keep my head tight
Couldn't bend my chords when I tried, tried, tried

He said
Oh, Did I ever call you honey
when that name wasn't ment for you
Did you ever see me running
for a girl half as good as you
Did you ever see me
Did I ever do it
No no no
Must be having one of these days made for messing up
I keep calling my baby but he's hanging up
oh oh oh

I screwed up badly the last time
Never going for another ride, ride, ride
It told me something new
that all the things we do
are better left undone, undone, undone

He said
Oh, Did I ever call you honey
when that name wasn't ment for you
Did you ever see me running
for a girl half as good as you
Did I ever lose it
Did I ever do it
No no no
Must be having one of these days made for messing up
I keep calling my baby but he's hanging up

I keep calling my baby but he's hanging up(x2)
