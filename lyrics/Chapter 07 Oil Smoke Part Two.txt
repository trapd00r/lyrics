Well each and every day I gotta keep on movin'
So Jah! Give me oil in me lamp and keep it burnin'

Jah give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
Jah give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
Jah give me lickle oil in me, (huh) keep it burnin'
Jah give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'

It's to Jah and only Jah who I man is praying
So all conscious people, I hope you are listening
Not just listening with you ears, but with your mind meditating
And vibing to the words that Pato Banton is preaching
A foolish man will tell you, "culture lyrics is boring"
I would leave that pancoot speechless when I ask him "what you a deal in?"
Like salt in a water, his brain will be dissolving
Smoke would come out of his ears like an old run down engine
Like a man struck by lightning he'll wonder what hit him
I'll cramp and paralyze him, then I will leave him
It no matter if him yellow black, white, brown, pink or green skin
Whoever fight 'gainst Jah surely deserves a beating

So give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
Jah give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
Just give me lickle oil in me, (huh) keep it burnin'
Just give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'

Well the devil is a crook don't be his next victim
He'll beak into your brain and check what your thinking
If your dreaming of gold, then gold you'll be wearing
If your wishing for money, then money you'll be spending
If you hoping for fun, then fun you'll be having
But remember all good things must come to an ending
Adam and Eve ina the garden it came to a sinning
Love between Cain and Abel, it came to a killing
Many good times I've had, had to come to ending
But let me carry on with what I was saying
Every time that you sin, the devil is laughing
Every wrong move you make brings you nearer towards him
But you've got your chance, while you are still living
To choose of life of goodness, or a life full of sinning
So when Satan says "come to the fiery dungeon"
It's only a wicked man soul, that boy will be taking

Just give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
Jah give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
Just give me lickle oil in me, (huh) keep it burnin'
Just give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'

Now all careless children, I hope you are listening
Not just listening with your ears, but with you mind concentrating
Me well serious I hope you don't think I'm joking
You should listen truth and right and no study diverse doctrine
Give thanks and praise in the night, also fist thing a morning
Try to squeeze in couple chapters of the Bible, every evening
Watch what you do, also mind what you saying
Every day, every hour, every minute, every second, Jah is watching
That's why me say "Do good and good will follow you, yeah ah!"

Just give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
Jah give me lickle oil in me, (huh) keep it burnin'
Just give me lickle oil in me, (huh) keep it burnin'
Just give me lickle oil in me, keep it burnin'
