I was shot in the back
by Nilfisk addicted cowboys
by jealousy struck
outnumbered by hard boiled luck (luck)

When I showed them the lights
of my 245 deep blue break
they all stood up and sang
'bout Swedish designer drugs

I was cutting a tree
and turning my jack into lumber
when the hitmen arrived
on a boat from the Isle of Song

I was shocked by the nude
identical twins on my lap
a cross-eyed effect
of Swedish designer drugs

It's hard to be strong
depending on northern refineries
How deep is your fjord
how shallow thy watery eyes

How could I recupe
surrounded by 95 dogma's
like a reindeer I'm struck
by Swedish designer drugs

I'm dating the maid
and driving electric wheelchairs
I'm cleaning the fish
with biodegradable pride

I was pulling the strings
while playing the fifteenth violin
in a director's cut
of Swedish designer drugs

I was hurting a fly
and winning all nobely prizes
I was probably drunk
by the probably best beer around

Like a viking in need
I got a medal for bad underacting
They all stood up and sang
about Swedish designer drugs
Swedish designer drugs
Swedish designer drugs
Swedish designer drugs
Swedish designer drugs
Swedish designer drugs
Swedish designer drugs
Swedish designer drugs

It's hard to be strong 
how deep is your fjord 
when I showed them the lights
they all stood up and sang
about Swedish designer drugs

It's hard to be strong
It's hard to be strong
how deep is your fjord
when I showed them the lights
they all stood up and sang
about Swedish designer drugs
