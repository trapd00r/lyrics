The sky isn't always blue 
The sun doesn't always shine 
It's alright to fall apart sometimes, mmm 
I am not always you 
And you are not always mine 
It's alright to fall apart sometimes 

After all is said and done 
One and one still is one 
When we cry, when we laugh 
I am half, you are half 

The heart isn't always true 
And I am not always fine 
We all have an angry heart sometimes 

After all is said and done 
One and one still is one 
When we cry, when we laugh 
I am half, you are half 

Look how far we have come 
One and one still is 

One moon (one moon) 
One star (one star) 


I love the one we are 
One thread (one thread) 
One line (one line) 
Let's stand still in time 

One moon (one moon) 
One star (one star) 
I love the one we are 
One thread (one thread) 
One line (one line) 
That runs through our lives 

After all is said and done 
One and one still is one 
When we cry, when we laugh 
I am half, you are half 

Look how far we have come 
One and one still is one ah 
Ooh
