You see, in the past
I had a dream, a fantasy
I thought that we would last
Become a little family

Then one, two, three, four
The years were flying by, they soared
And it's my gut feeling
It's not happening for me, so

Let's end it on this
Give me one more kiss
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this

You see, it's hard to face
The addict that's inside of me
I want to fill my glass up
With you constantly

I've been here before
But I've never ever felt this sure
And now I know I've been dreaming
And your actions have inspired me

So, let's end it on this
Give me one more kiss
(It's over)
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
(It's over)

Just one more hitch
One last kiss
(It's over)
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this

I open up, you ignore me
Oh, you're not the same at all
And if I could turn back the pages of time
I'd rewrite your point of view

Washed up on the shore
Give me one last chance to try some more
But I'm tired, I'm freezing
Let's stop and call it history

Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
(It's over)
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
(It's over)

Let's end it on this
End it on this
(It's over)
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
(It's over)

Washed up on the shore
Given me one last chance to try some more
But, let's end it on this
Let's end it on this

It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over
