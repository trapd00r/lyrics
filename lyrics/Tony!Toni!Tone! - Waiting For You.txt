I anit trippen on none of her home girls
and I anit trippen on none of my home boys
if we gone be together we gone be together

Just me and you
(ow babe)
Just me and you
Just us two

Just me and you

[1st Verse]

Needless to say
you know I really want you
I feel like you can make me happy
Take a trip far
and let me do my thang
Forget about what you heard
lets get personal

[Chorus]

Just me and you
(Just me and you)
Dont worry bout Michael
Dont worry bout Jonny (we dont need nobody else)
Dont worry bout Terry baby

Just me and you
(Just me and you)
Dont worry bout Tracey
Dont worry bout Tina (we dont need nobody else)
Dont worry bout a dame thang
Just me and you

[2nd Verse]

As far as my personal taste
Is concerned
I really really love the way
you made me wait so long
Now that the both of us
really know each other
It's time that we
explored one another

Dont worry bout a dame thang
(Baby Baby)

[Chorus]

[Guitar break]

Dont worry bout a dame thang
(Dont worry dout a dame thang)

[Chorus x3: fade out]
