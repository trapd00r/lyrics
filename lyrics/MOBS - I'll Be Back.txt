[Zombie:]
They call me undead an ABOMINATION
Better get yourself prepared for ZOMBIE CHASIN
Once I'm on your tail
I cannot be stopped
I'll keep slammin' on your door until I KNOCK IT OFF
Is one of three words
In my vocab
If I say BLEH BLEH
Then you made me MAD
And if you push me
I'll push you back
My skin is green and my heart is BLACK

[Skeleton:]
I'm like walking corpse of LEGOLAS
I got a bow in my hand and I NEVER MISS
I'm menace to everybody in the game
You hear my bones CLICK CLACK
And ya know my name
Cuz I'm a skeleton
Ya better run
I'll shoot ya bum PUNK
Just because I think it's fun
If you're outside at night
You should try to hide
I'll be lookin' for ya while I take a SPIDER RIDE
WOOO

[Creeper:]
Don't mistake me for a walking penis
Yes I'm shaped like one
But I'm quite egregious
Because everybody runs
No one ever hits me
You know if I go down
I'm TAKING YOU WITH ME
HISSSSSSS
That's the only sound I make
And if you hear me nearby
Then it's probably too late
My massive blast radius
Will hit your bum
Say goodbye level 50
Hello level ONE

[Hook:]
The sun goes down
That's when
They get started
They've got one mission
That's to
Kill the target

Are you the kinda miner who can fight off all the mobs?
Or are you
Just another noob
Who keeps
Creative mode on?

[Zombie Pigman:]
I spawn within the depths of nether
So I'm rather accustomed to fiery weather
And I'm on patrol with a golden sword
Gettin' ready to attack
So COME AT ME BRO
SNORT SNORT
Don't try to make me OVERREACT
Because once I'm provoked, you get the WHOLE PACK
You may call us butt buddies and we are just that cuz we smell like bacon and we taste like ASS

[Villager:]
I'm just a villager dude
I was caught in the middle of a CRAZY feud
I just grow my herbs and smoke my pipe
I have a tiny house bro
THIS IS MY LIFE
I just do what I can to get by then the mobs and griefers screw me over
WHY!?!?!?!
Let's all live in HARMONY!
We can work together dudes
Come along with me!!!

[Hook]

Are you the kinda miner who can fight off all the mobs?
Or are you
Just another noob
Who sleeps in bed until dawn?

[Ghast:]
My voice is high-pitched so nobody likes me
I can't live in a house
Cuz that'd be a tight squeeze
I fly freely with my eyes squeezed tight
Take a nap in the sky
Till find a fight and then I SQUEAL like a girl and I breathe fireballs
If you think that you can take me then I hope you're kinda tall
I'm the biggest in size and I use it well
I may sound like a baby but I SPAWN IN HELL

[Enderman:]
Well...
I'm an Enderman...
...rapping isn't my THING
But I guess I'll do SOMETHING since...
I'd prefer not to SING
I'm tall and dark, all I do is walk minding my own business until I'm pissed off
Is this block from your house?
WELL NOW IT'S MINE
Don't look at my face and we'll be JUST FINE

[Hook]

Are you the kinda miner who can fight off all the mobs?
Or are you
Just another noob
Who spawns whatever he wants?
PATHETIC

[Hook]

Are you the kinda miner who can fight off all the mobs?
Or are you
Just another noob
Who sounds like somebody's MOM?!?!
