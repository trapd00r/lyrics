Plastic flowers in her hair
Don't they make a lovely pair
Met last night at the slot machines
All night preacher does the ceremony
Him in leather, her in jeans
His wife throws Minute Rice, her tears are phony

But wedding vows in Vegas
You've got to be courageous
To play the odds that love will win
Aren't meant to last for ages
Whatever city you're in

A Polaroid's an extra twenty
Shoot the works man, we've got plenty
Thanks a heap and come again
Witness is another ten
Buffet dinner, nothing but the best
And check into some strip love nest

But wedding vows in Vegas
You've got to be courageous
Aren't meant to last for ages
To play the odds that love will win
Whatever city you're in

Ice cold Chablis, cable TV
How can this be?
Baby, then it's you and me
Continental breakfast free, it's you
And check into some strip love nest
Buffet dinner, nothing but the best

But wedding vows in Vegas
Aren't meant to last for ages
To play the odds that love will win
You've got to be courageous
Whatever city you're in
