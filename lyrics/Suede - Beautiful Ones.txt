Oh, high on diesel and gasoline
Psycho for drum machine
Shaking their bits to the hits
Oh, drag acts, drug acts, suicides
In your dad's suits you hide
Staining his name again

Oh, cracked up, stacked up, twenty-two
Psycho for sex and glue
Lost it to Bostik, yeah
Oh, shaved heads, rave heads, on the pill
Got too much time too kill
Get into bands and gangs

Oh, here they come
The beautiful ones
The beautiful ones
La la la la la
Here they come
The beautiful ones
The beautiful ones
La la la la la

Loved up, doved up, hung around
Stoned in a lonely town
Shaking their meat to the beat
Oh, high on diesel and gasoline
Psycho for drum machine
Shaking their bits to the hits

Oh, here they come
The beautiful ones
The beautiful ones
La la la la la
Here they come
The beautiful ones
The beautiful ones

Oh, you don't think about it
You don't do without it
Because you're beautiful
Yeah, yeah

And if your baby's going crazy
That's how you made me
La, la
And if your baby's going crazy
That's how you made me
Whoa, whoa
And if your baby's going crazy
That's how you made me
La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la la...
