Ugly girls beckon to me 
Oh no, I don't care 
Like a rose waiting for a bumblebee 
Me no wanna go in there 

Ugly girls beckon to me 
Oh no, I don't care 
Like a rose waiting for a bumblebee 
Me no wanna go in there, I said, me no wanna go in there

In my life, I have trust everything, In my life
In my life, where there once was a ring, In my life
In my life, there was glitter and gold, In my life 
I have never foretold that the glitter and gold 
Were so heartless and cold, In my life 
In my life, where there once was a song, I my life
Now that is gone
In my life, nothing is clear
In my life, will you help me from fear 
Me no wanna go there, I have got no point on my spear, noo

Ugly girls beckon to me 
Oh no, I don't care 
Like a rose waiting for a bumblebee 
Me no wanna go in there 

Ugly girls beckon to me 
Oh no, I don't care 
Like a rose waiting for a bumblebee 
Me no wanna go in there, me no wanna go in there

In my life, all my colour is grey, In my life
In my life, night will never be day, In my life
In my life, there is no nightingale 
Cause my life has become like a jail 
No one to go my way, ugly girls on the trail 

Ugly girls beckon to me 
Oh no, I don't care 
Like a rose waiting for a bumble bee 
Me no wanna go in there

Ugly girls beckon to me 
Oh no, I don't care 
Like a rose waiting for a bumble bee 
Me no wanna go in there, I said, me no wanna go in there, no way.(x2)
