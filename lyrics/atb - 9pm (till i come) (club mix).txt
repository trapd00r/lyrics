9pm (Till I Come):
Till I Come!
Change it and say 'Till I Come'!

Don't Stop:
Don't stop...it's the real sound.

The Summer:
The summer is here...
You wanna feel somebody
Irrational impulses

The Fields Of Love:
Have you ever seen the fields of love?
Have you ever felt the seeds of love?

Killer:
So you want to be free, to live your life the way you wanna be.
Will you give if we cry?
Will we live...or will we die?
Tainted hearts heal with time.
Shoot that love so we can stop the end aha

Solitary brother
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary Sister
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?

If we try and live your lives the way you wanna be, yeah.

Racism in among future kings can only lead to no good.
Besides, all our sons and daughters already know how that feels yeah yeah yeah
