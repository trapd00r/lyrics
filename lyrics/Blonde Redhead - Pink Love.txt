I won't bind my strings to you 
But build my world beside you 
Watching you draw a line 
Some say you are, you are 
Just like a butterfly 
Whose broken wings will spread 
To softly feel your mood 
Over the blue sky full of you 
Pink love, pink love, pink love 
Just like a fairytale 

My only reason naturally 
Starts to get to me 
Pushing my way through 
Mesh of life 
I want to kiss the sickness of mind 
My heart without reason 
Sunken to deep disappointment 
Spreads over universe 
With a knife 
I want to bleed out distress like this 

It's not just a fairytale that's painted by me 
It's not just the loneliness between you and I 
If on magic mountain you find you can breathe 
Then stay don't look back 
To the blue woven sky 

Storms of petals are pouring down 
Pushing their way through our pink love 
So many polka dots painted by me 
Spreads over universe for you 
And I, I want to kiss 
Pink love, pink love 
I want to kiss 
Pink love, pink love 

In my mind 
I state myself 
The clock is ticking without you 
Some may say illness 
So called so called love 
The sickness of mind
