Super trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the super trouper
Lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Feelin' like a number one

Tonight the super trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinkin' about you only
(Still I'm thinkin' about you only)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the super trouper
Lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Feelin' like a number one

Tonight the super trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you

So I'll be there
When you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me
I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Tonight the super trouper
Lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Feelin' like a number one

Tonight the super trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you

Super trouper
Lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
Feelin' like a number one

Tonight the super trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per troupe-p-per)
