See them walking hand in hand
Across the bridge at midnight
Heads turning as the lights flashing out
Are so bright
And walk right out to the four line track
There's a camera rolling on her back
On her back
And I sense a rhythm humming in a frenzy
All the way down her spine

Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film

Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling
And miles of sharp blue water coming in
Where she lies
The diving man's coming up for air
'Cause the crowd all love pulling Dolly by the hair
By the hair
And she wonders how she ever got here
As she goes under again

Girls on film (Two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (Got your picture)
Girls on film

Wider, baby, smile and you've just made a million
Fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire
Take one last glimpse into the night
I'm touching close
I'm holding bright, holding tight
Give me shudders in a whisper
Take me up 'til I'm shooting a star

Girls on film (She's more than a lady)
Girls on film
Girls on film (Two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (See you together)
Girls on film
Girls on film (See you later)
Girls on film
