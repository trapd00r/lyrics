I can remember your birthday like it was my birthday
Remember the first thing, you said on the first day
We met at the airport, we get what we wait for

We hugged and we drove toward
The town where I was born
It wasn't a big place but it was a spring board
We finally made love, we get what we wait for

I don't wanna look back
And then regret that
Everything I looked past
I couldn't see that

Love is in the small things
Love is in the small things

I don't wanna look back
And then regret that
Say why did it go bad
I couldn't see that

Love is in the small things

I remember the first kiss like it was my first kiss
Remember the restaurant we ate at that cheap spot
You said it was tough luck but to me it was perfect

We went to a party that, night in the country and
Met all your friends and then had to leave early cause
You were really all - I was waiting for

I don't wanna look back
And then regret that
Everything I looked past
I couldn't see that

Love is in the small things
Love is in the small things

I don't wanna look back
And then regret that
Say why did it go bad
I couldn't see that

Love is in the small things

Love is in the small things, don't forget it
Love is in the small things, don't forget it
Love is in the small things, don't forget it
Don't forget it, don't forget it

Love is in the small things, don't forget it
Love is in the small things, don't forget it
Love is in the small things, don't forget it
Don't forget it, don't forget it

I don't wanna look back
And then regret that
Everything I looked past
I couldn't see that

Love is in the small things
Love is in the small things

I don't wanna look back
And then regret that
Say why did it go bad
I couldn't see that

Love is in the small things
