You took your love away
Too fast
Left no chance to say
Look Back
Now I know the truth
It makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by
I'll understand

(Chorus)
Lets pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away

You threw it all away
So blind
Pushed me far from you
In your life
And now I know the tears won't lead to lonliness
Baby when time goes by
I'll understand

Lets pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away

I run away
I run away
I run away

Lets pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away

I run away

Lets pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away

(Repeat until fade)
