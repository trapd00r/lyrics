Waiting (X6) 

I'm waiting for your love 
I'm waiting for your love 
Don't wanna loose that feelin' 
I'm waiting for your love 
Let me hold you in my arms 

I'm waiting for your love
Don't wanna loose that feelin'
I'm waiting for your love
Let me hold you in my arms, tonight...

Whisper; I'm waiting for your love
I'm laying in my bed, crying
Waiting for your love
Oh can you give me one more chance

I'm waiting for your love
Don't wanna loose that feelin'
I'm waiting for your love
Let me hold you in my arms

I'm waiting for your love
Never wanna loose that feelin'
I'm waiting for your love
Let me hold you in my arms, tonight...
