I held your hand I hold my breath now for a while
I try to concentrate I try to be alive
You took my whole life now and shared with a lie
I almost fell into your world agony cries
How will it ever work out fine, you tell me that you rather be

Take your life now take mine heaven's in denial
You former kind one now you're evil in sight
Tear it up

Cause/Yeah You wish for

How do you like it standing there when your hopes up
And with my eyes I stare
All this will be over with a smile again

What are you wishing for?
When you're standing there all alone
