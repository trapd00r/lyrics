when you say you want me close
i wonder how far we go
i've never been so sure before
you make me loose it all
every time you hold me near
it's like i'm flying above the atmosphere
i've never been so sure before
you make me lose it, you make me lose it all

i've always known what i've wanted
and sure how to get it
never know the blush (oh no)
but now it feels like i'm slippin
Can't keep it together
adrenalin rush (yeah, yeah)

i think you don't even know
how much you amaze me
you took me by storm (took my by storm)

when you say you want me close (me close)
i wonder how far we go
i've never been so sure before
you make me lose it all (make me lose it)
every time you hold me near (me near)
it's like i'm flying above the atmosphere
i've never been so sure before
you make me lose it, you make me lose it all

and even when you're not with me
you know how to reach me
invisible touch (invisible touch, ah)
i never thought it would happen
you make me come down with
A hardcore crush (crush)

i think you don't even know
how much you amaze me
you took me by storm (took my by storm)

when you say you want me close (me close)
i wonder how far we go
i've never been so sure before

it's like i'm flying with the atmosphere
i've never been so sure before
you make me lose it, you make me lose it all
