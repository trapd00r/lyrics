Say you see through the folly
But you do it for the fame
And I'm fighting the jet stream
Drinkin' cheap wine on airplanes

And you're in L.A., not Chicago
Key under mat, I walk the dog, order in, home alone

Found your letter on a full moon Sunday night
Another girl, and you spell, guess he's back for a night
Pour the vodka, and it dulls sharp fights
Breaking words, a diamond band ring

And you didn't mean to do it
So I don't have to believe it
If you didn't really do it
And magical thinking gets us by

You sing for the after show, those candy colored lips
But your age is showing, and you gotta work harder for it
It's always easier with freshmen
And I'm not as clever, if she needed a ride

And you didn't mean to do it
So I don't have to believe it
If we didn't really do it
And magical thinking gets us by

Fair-weathered friends
Fair-weathered friends

Say you see through the folly
But you do it for the fame
And I am fragile as porcelain
Drinking cheap wine on airplanes
And did I ever leave Chicago?
I got your message, glad you're doing well

And you didn't mean to do it
So I don't have to believe it
If we didn't really do it
And magical thinking gets us by

Oo, oo
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame

My fair-weathered friend
