Yeah, yeah, have you heard the news today?
People right across the world
Are pledging they will play the game.
Victims of the modern world,
Circumstance has brought us here,
Armageddon's come too near,
Too, too near now.
Foresight is the only key,
To save our children's destiny,
The consequences are so grave,
So, so grave now.
The hypocrites we are their slaves,
So my friends to stop the end,
On each other we depend,
Oh, we depend.

Mountain high and river deep,
Stop it goin' on.
We gotta wake this world up from its sleep,
Oh, people.
Stop it goin' on.

Yeah, yeah, have you heard the news today?
Money's on the menu in my favourite restaurant.
Well don't talk about quantity,
'Cuz there's no fish left in the sea;
Greedy men been killing all the life there ever was.
And you'd better play it nature's way,
Or she will take it all away,
And don't try and tell me you know more than her 'bout right from
wrong.
Oh you've upset the balance man,
Done the only thing you can,
Now my life is in your hands.

Mountain high and river deep,
