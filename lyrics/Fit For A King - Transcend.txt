Let it all in, the things that you love most. Let it all in, the things that make you proud. Wait for something more and pray for this new day. Wait for something more and pray. I'm searching within to find direction. I'm searching within to hear your perfect note. Know that you were made for so much more. There's something to live for. Wait for something more and pray for this new day. Wait for something more and pray. If you'll look inside, I'm ripped apart. Wait for something more and pray for this new day. Wait for something more and pray.
