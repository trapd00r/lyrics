When you're feelin' lost and you're overflowing
When you don't know what to do or where to start
Just think of me as a train that's comin'
Comin' to bring you to your heart

And when the dark descends upon you
When you're locked inside your worried mind
I'll be the light to bring you understanding
I'll be the hand to rock you sweet and kind

There is such beauty that awaits you
There is such peace in my embrace
I'll be the rain to wash away your hesitation
I'll be the eye to see your true face

Take just one step in my direction
Take just one more and we will never part
Just think of me as a train that's comin'
Comin' to bring you to your heart

Just think of me as a train that's comin'
Comin' to bring you to your heart
Comin' to bring you to your heart
