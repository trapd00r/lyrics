Who got the buzzer
Who got the bell
You gonna false start
Who gonna tell
Got no possessions
Got no car
Just close my eyes
Gone too far

I don't care when my heads outta phase
I'm prepared to feel just great
I don't care for getting stuck
With a life of wasted time
You got my number
I'm on your list
Do me a favour
Stick to the wrist
Don't like that nose job
Don't like her hair
You heard the latest?
Who really cares

I don't care if my head's outta phase
I'm prepared to feel just great
I don't care for getting stuck
With a life of wasted time
I prefer walking out of line

The latest offer
You got the time
Why do you bother?
A movement sideways
It's all it takes
Stand back
