(Chorus)
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye

Thinking of you
And the love of our lives
In the sweet summertime
So sad but true (so true, so true)
We must leave it behind in our hearts, in our minds
From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember

(Chorus x 2)

Memories can fade (they can fade)
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face (on your face)
And maybe someday (someday)
We can be more than friends love will find us again
Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared on the time that we borrowed

(Chorus x 2)

From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember baby

(Chorus x 2)

We'll leave behind the summertime, our hearts, our minds
They will remind, we won't forget
The day we met
The day we cried
Autumn goodbye

(Chorus)
(2nd chorus fades out)
