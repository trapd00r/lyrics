Is there a land
Maybe close to you
Where I can stay
And maybe wait for you

A stony shore
Is what I have in mind
With a path
Leading to a home close behind

I know I will be there
What about you?

When you’ve caught a dream
All you wanna say
And make an easy promise
It will always be this way

But if you come
Maybe I won’t show how glad I am
But I would feel that promise
You shouldn’t give any man

I know I will be there
What about you?

Is there a land
I won’t have to leave so fast
Is there a shore
That could catch me at last

I know I will be there
Probably you won’t no
I know I will be there
But you, no you won’t

I know I will be there
I don’t know about you
I know I'll be there
But what about you
What about you?
