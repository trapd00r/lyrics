This is how a gangsta sing the star spangled banner
Pledge allegiance to the flag in a hardcore manner
Blue bandana, clip, oh nana
That nigga leaving what the fuck you do blood?
Red bandana, clip, oh nana
Big flashin’ ya clip, what the fuck you do blood?

It’s the return of that gangsta gully shit
Black Northface, braids up, under my black skully bitch
I still feel chills when the narcs come
My lil homie scrap the 40 we come around and spark something
Let off half a clip, make ya whip lay
You rock petty nigga shells, it hit ya make ya softer than whipped cream
Funny things are never how shit seems
You going HAM, we like damn, you don’t really want it man
We pop right up on you, gun in hand
This southside, muthafuckas get smoked here
We’ll see if ya still tough when the smoke clears
We at the hospital waiting to see the folks yeah

Blue bandana, clip, oh nana
That nigga leaving what the fuck you do blood?
Red bandana, clip, oh nana
Big flashin’ ya clip, what the fuck you do blood?

Nigga fuck that, you better put that work in
You don’t want to, cool, You could get hurt than
Red bandana, Blue bandana, clip, oh nana
What the fuck is up blood?
