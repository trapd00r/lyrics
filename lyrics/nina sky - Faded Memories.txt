Neva wanted to say good-bye
Time passes, people change (you've changed)
At this moment, I can't cry
Sadness like my body left me feeling insane
I was crazy for you
Needed you like the blood in my veins
Would have done anything for you
I Guess your feelings weren't the same
Stuck in the past, thought it would last
Now I'm sitting here alone
Stuck in the past, thought it would last
My fairy tale's all gone
Stuck in the past, thought it would last
Trying to carry on...

Faded memories, linger beside me
Everywhere I go, I see you, feel you, hear you...
Baby I need you
Faded memories, linger beside me
Everywhere I go, I see you, feel you, hear you...
Baby I need you
Baby I need you

Like flowers need the sun or
A drummer needs a drum
My souls incomplete when you left all of me
I'm dangerously in love with you
All I long to hear was you love me too
The years, the cries, the tears, the lies
Yet still I try, I try, I try
To make this love survive
But I am fond about these memories

Baby I need you, Baby I need you,
Baby I need you, Baby I need you,
Baby I need you, Baby I need you,
Baby I need you, Baby I need you,
Baby I need you, Baby I need you
