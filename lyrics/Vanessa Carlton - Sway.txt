my heart, your hands, gentle my friend
break me neatly, numb me sweetly

say you would, say you could
say you'd come and stop the rain
say you'd try and hold me tight
and you just give me away
make me high on lullabies
a melody for me to sway
say you would, say you could
and you don't do anything

come down heavy, try and steady
precious ladies, love you, love me...

[chorus]

hold my head up to the lies that you feed me
I'll fall under the spell you cast as you let me down

say you would, say you could
say you'd come and stop the rain
say you'd try and hold me tight
and you just give me away
make me high on lullabies
a melody for me to sway
make me high on lullabies a melody for me to sway

[chorus]

say you'd come and stop the rain...
