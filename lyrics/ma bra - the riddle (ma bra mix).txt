I know where the music came from, I not a lame dumb dumb
Origin is respected but still we choose to come, original 
Down from my talk to my walkin' 
Heads out to please the king Christopher Walken 
A city with fly lingo and bad ass latinas 
Got heads on this side biting styles still unequal 
Unless you assimilate you never considered great
Demonstrate the speech from your birth place you can't race 
Disgraced by false handshakes, these punk rap dudes 
Talk behind our back but they don't want the feud 
A few of them seen the ads y'all helped us pay for 
Now they say what's up in the club! What the fuck whore!? 
Listen up bitch!  You diss because you can't see 
Born in California actin' N Y C 
Influence is golden but when mics is holding 
I roll with the oath to spit what's never stolen 
It keeps us out the mix shows and tape decks of 64's 
Because we in the middle, we strangers to the riddle 
For DJs who play this the bravest get propers 
But most won't even touch this unless we sign to Rawkus!

I met you twice before and shook your hand
You didn't feel it
Did it for the cap but should have acted like I'd peel it
Now I'm in the skillet on the burner in the back
Caught between the trunk bump and the motherfucking boom bap
Bring the tune back, 
You're craps in the chop shop
Thermometer up your ass
That's the reason that I'm not hot
But I got a fever times three for every CD
Bound to be the missing link 
For those who want to meet me at the crossing
I'll be the one semi-flossing 
With mega self-respect but avoid to go with that
Cause he's employed to act like he doesn't see the free man
Oops that's too much credit, I bet it isn't the plan
Freak of nature, I'm the stranger, you're bad with names bra
Change your views, I'm giving clues
Strangest news you're about to lose
Blame them fools who got the tools.

I'd never consider moving out 
When it comes to the coast I'm dwelling on
Hell if I ever switch up the weather 
To fit what these other fellas are on 
I cause a renaissance 
Renovating creativeness on this side of the coast
Self-hatred, radio stations
They play their shit while they brag and they boast
It's not about toe tagging with a rag and a magnum 
It's all about respect
Caught in the middle without a clue 
Legendary originality here to battle the fallacy
Here to put it down with my crew
Actually I'm open to any option, except belly flopping 
Over a sloppy copy of a Primo track, that's a fact
Action taken by middlemen 
While you fiddle with pens and pronouns 
Trying to pronounce like your pro-eastern affiliate
When I affiliate my style with the golden state 
While you're holding hate, claiming to hold weight
Now, much respect to the roots but once you've walked in these boots 
Doing a format like that is so fake
You're a dormant doormat 
Wearing a whores hat 
With a horrible imitation of what you consider great
When that's only a bite.
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach 
So when you plummet into the darkness
We'll be rising into the light (that's right, that's right)
So when you plummet into the darkness
We'll be rising into the light (that's right, that's right)

[Aesop]
I'm anti, but I'm not anti-social 
You can feel it through my soul 
My presence through my vocals 
"How the fuck they got fans? 
Man them niggas only local." 
Bitch we chase down the mic 
And put you rhymes in a chokehold 
I'm a pro bro, comin' fresh ain't a problem so 
Legends' got skills 
Cause we're always evolvin' 
And involvin' our self in the life of our fans 
Revolvin' around them like the earth on its axis 
And neva payin' no taxes man 
Firm in my shoes where I stand 
Not a stranger to this land 
With my choice of words I gain respect and proceed 
They say if you don't succeed try, try again my friend 
Ya must make words blend within the beat then 
Make it a part of this world, make your mark on this earth 
For what it's worth, evade the demons while they lurk 
In the envy of the jerks bi-coastal who smirk 
At the talent and the balance that shine in our work 
The suckas love to hate us and these girls LOVE TO FLIRT 
Stranger to the under ground, ya neva dug the dirt 
True we blowin' up fool and it hurts to be you 
Still tryin' to sound like them, just to make it through!!!!
