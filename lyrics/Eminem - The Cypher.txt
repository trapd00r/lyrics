Like a dope fiend,
Opening up a bottle of dopamine,
.....
Throat, choked anything,
Oh and just think how dope it could be,
If he smoked anything,
Oh there goes the bell,
The sound of the opening ding,
I hit you as hard as barbiturates
In the ribs with a switch and stitch you at the same time before you could flinch to it,
My dick is so big if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it,
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fucking bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet,

Now watch me kill a koala, while I maul a Chihuahua,
Bum a pill off of ....
Like let me holla at you mama,
It's like I'm off that ba ba when I bring the fucking drama,
Used to bomb ya like Saddam, but now that I'm a lil calmer,
I'm a fucking cross between Osama, ...., Obama and Dalai Lama,
Tell Miley I'm her knight in shining armor,
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer, a picture of my genitalia,
With a note sayin bitch I can't wait to nail ya.
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya,
That's' him in the Sheep's clothes, he just shaved his hair off Cecilia
