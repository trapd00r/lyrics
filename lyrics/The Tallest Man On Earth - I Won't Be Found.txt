Well, if I ever see the morning
Just like a lizard in the spring
I'm gonna run out in the meadow
To catch the silence where it sings

I'm gonna force the Serengeti
To disappear into my eyes
And when I hear your voices calling
I'm gonna turn just inside out

Well, if I ever get to slumber
Just like a mole deep in the ground
Hell, I won't be found

Deep in the dust forgot and gathered
I'll grow a diamond in my chest
I make reflections as the moon shine
Turn to a villain as I rest

Well if I ever get to slumber
Just like a mole deep in the ground
Hell, I won't be found

I know there is a hollow
I need to fill it with a draft
Of all the words that I won't say
And with a quiet whisper
I send a curse upon the day
That never used the sun to see
The light

I'm gonna float up in the ceiling
I built a levee of the stars
And in my field of tired horses
I built a freeway through this farce

Well if I ever get that slumber
I'll be that mole deep in the ground
And I won't be found
