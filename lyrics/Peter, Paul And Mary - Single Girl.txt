When I was a single girl, dressed in clothes so fine,
Now I am a married girl, go ragged all the time
Wish I was a single girl again
Wish I was a single girl again 

When I was a single girl, had shoes of the very best kind
Now I am a married girl, go barefoot all the time
Wish I was a single girl again
Wish I was a single girl again 

When I was a single girl, used to go to the store and buy
Now I am a married girl, just rock that cradle and cry
Wish I was a single girl again
Wish I was a single girl again 

When a fella comes a' courtin' you, and sits you on his knee,
Keep your eye upon the sparrow that flits from tree to tree
And you'll never wish you were a single girl like me
You'll never wish you were a single girl like me
Wish I was a single girl again
