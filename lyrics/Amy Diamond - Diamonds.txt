Diamonds are for keeps
Diamonds are forever
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds will be shining
For a million years
So will we my dear

We don't really care for glitter
And caviar's far too bitter
Silver and gold doesn't blow us away
It's simply true what they say

Diamonds are for keeps
Diamonds are forever
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds will be shining
For a million years
So will we my dear

Why settle for less than perfect
The luster alone is worth it
Remarkably, sparkly thing I adore
Glamour galore, koh I noor

Time goes on, changes come
But they will always stay in trend
That's what makes a girl's best friend

(Ah)

Diamonds are for keeps
Diamonds are forever
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds will be shining
For a million years
So will we my dear


So will we my dear
