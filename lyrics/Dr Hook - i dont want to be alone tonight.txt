Your phone's gonna ring in the darkness of night
And you'll rise from the bed where you lay
And you'll answer 'Hello', and from out of the past
A voice you once loved is gonna say

I don't wanna be alone tonight, I don't wanna be alone
And I had to call someone who used to care
I don't wanna be alone tonight, I don't wanna be alone
So say that you still want me and I'll be there

Maybe someday you'll lie there and look at the rain
Feeling afraid and alone
Feeling of hunger you just can't explain
And you'll be the voice on the phone

I don't wanna be alone tonight, I don't wanna be alone
And I had to call someone who used to care
I don't wanna be alone tonight, I don't wanna be alone
So say that you still want me and I'll be there

I don't wanna be alone tonight, I don't wanna be alone
And I had to call someone who used to care
I don't wanna be alone tonight, I don't wanna be alone
So say that you still want me and I'll be there
