Will you walk straight? we're not like them
To fool them in, make it seem like you're in trouble
Make a sound, fake it enough.
What made you so scared?
Maybe your mistaken for someone who cares

If you remember, remember
I've been trying to get back to the center
I'm sure it's not like it was before

To make them drink, tell them that it's only water
No one leaves till we figure this out
What made you so scared?
Maybe your mistaken for someone who cares

If you remember, remember
I've been trying to get back to the center
I'm sure it's not like it was before

Patience,
Both we and our words are over produced by influence
By influence
Patience
Both we and our words are over produced by influence
By influence
By influence

I'm only asking if you remember, remember
I've been trying to get back to the center
And I'm sure it's not like it was.
