You know girl
I've been waitin
Huh

I can see you girl
Watch'n through your television
Smiling with your friends think'n I don't notice
But I got your full attention
So let me tell you girl, after the make-up
And lights come down
I just wanna run away and do whatever we want

I wanna take you to a spot where
We can chill outside
Or we can see a movie I know that's what you like
If that's what your into- then that's what I'm into
Cause I know you like me girl, and you know that I do to

/Chorus:
I wanna run down the street, get to the end
Where we meet
I wanna watch you smile, that makes my life worth while
Feel so complete when with you, you always know what to do
I just wanna say today, Baby I love you

I can feel you girl
You got your arms wrapped up around me
Tell'n all your friends I'm the one you dig
And how I make you oh so happy
Well let me tell you girl, I'll try to never
Ever let you down
You can always trust me cause I'll never
Break your heart

I wanna take you to a spot where
We can chill outside
Or we can see a movie I know that's
What you like
If that's what your into- then that's what I'm into
Cause I know you like me girl, and you know that I do to

/Chorus

So many people try'n to pull at me
Pull'n at the same time
I try to tell about you girl but
They don't understand our love NO!
I know that you're not really here but
You're only in my dreams
I hope that you one day, will step out and come my way...

/Chorus x 2
