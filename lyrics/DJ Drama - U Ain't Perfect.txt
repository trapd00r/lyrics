[Trey Songz:]
Oh my oh my oh oh my god
My nigga you see that ass upon that broad?
Dumb, dumb, dumb,
That booty so retarded
And when it come to this r'n'b shit I'm the hardest, regardless

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You the one girl, you the one girl
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Yeah you got that body of a Goddess
And it ain't no competition you got it
I want it, I'm on it
You make me wanna say

Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my

That booty bumping, oh my, that booty bumping
(Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You know me I do my thang with the women
I Make her body purr when I'm touching on the kitten
Booty so round, waist so skinny
Hit in on the balcony with your face to the city!
Face so pretty, heels so high that I face your titties
Mouth so dry, I could taste your titties
Girl I'm a hit it right, have faith, no Biggie
Oh my, I'm so high
Come and be one of Tremaine angels, fly
The sky is the limit, I been fly for a minute
And the girls say I'm fast so rewind it a minute
GO!
I want you on my team, we be like Charlie Sheen
Winning this life of sinning, where women be liking women
And men is like ripping lemons
Sour when I pass by, wait till I'm in them denims
I'm a hit that ass LIKE!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You the one girl, you the one girl
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Yeah you got that body of a Goddess
And it ain't no competition you got it
I want it, I'm on it
You make me wanna say

Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
That booty bumping, oh my, that booty bumping
(Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best)

[Verse 2: Tity Boi]
Shawty you the one, ain't too many choices
Louis on my feet, cost me ten pairs of Air Forces
When you mention me, know my girls are really gorgeous
I be all up in the cut, like some neosporin
Tity two chains, I got my name on my upholstery
Married to the streets, ain't no way you can divorce it
Got the ceiling crack, so I'm shining like an ocean
Got them racks on top of racks, like I was hanging in a closet
Hol up Hol up, pause it
Flows that will make you nauseous
Got a girl with a back so big and an ass so big look like shes crawling
Balling balling spalding
Yeah we Chris Paulin'
I just call her boo but I met her at the mall
Me and DJ Drama, add another comma
I put it in her ribs and say I'm working on her stomach
This girl I'm with' she mine, the girl you with she mine!
I put her ass on top, then I press recline

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You the one girl, you the one girl
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Yeah you got that body of a Goddess
And it ain't no competition you got it
I want it, I'm on it
You make me wanna say

Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
Oh my, Oh my, Oh my
That booty bumping, oh my, that booty bumping
(Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Now I'm who all these bad bitches gripping,
Bitch niggas dissin, Finally Famous Over Everything is still the mission
Pussy nigga you a pussy, so who the hell is you kiddin' (Get it?)
Here you taking shots, now what the fuck is you sipping?
Nigga I'm, at the tippy, I run my city, then run in the club, they bringing my liccy
I pull down her zippy, I'm all in her viccies, she calling me Biggy
I'm calling her silly
Never slip, cause I'm rollin' up sticky, she gave me her iccy
Girl you the baddest
I promise I'm picky and even if we fuck I promise that you ain't fucking with me
Bad bitches know what's up, she tells me that she love me
I tell her join the club
D-Town reppin till I die hoe, chilling on the top floor

[Chorus]
