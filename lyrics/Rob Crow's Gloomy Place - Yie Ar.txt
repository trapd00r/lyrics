Day came too soon
Found out in this dream
Father of the downturned carries us all
They love the feud
Carol of the doomed
Patter of the dismayed carries us all
When did it leave?
When did all go?
Right then
Right there
Where did all this go?
Falling from view
It lands too far
Fell asleep, our clothes were soaked in rain
When you we wake up, they're dry enough again
Daylight taken for granted
It's a novel concept for you
Wading through these days til you're just forgotten
I still find time to miss you
What more do you think you'll get around to?
That's the furthest distance you'll ever go?
Or are you content?
Or are you content right here?
Right now?
Throw it all in
