Whatcha gonna do
When the wall comes down?
When the wall comes down?
What you oughta do is let it lie
Let it lie
And in the gathering darkness vow
To never come back
It was built by man and you can tear it down
Tear it down
Tear it down

Aw, step back, Jack, from the darkness

Whatcha gonna do
When the shackles fall?
When the shackles fall?
What you oughta do is melt them down
Melt them down
Why, turn them into tools and make a garden
On the prison grounds
Or turn your chains to roses, child
But, tear it down
Tear it down

Aw, step back, Jack, from the darkness
While I'm here
I'm gonna sing just like a songbird

Oh, whatcha gonna do
When the hunger's gone?
When the hunger's gone?
Yes, pity the child who goes without
Oh, goes without
Why, give him no reason to falter
On his way down
It's a beautiful world but painful, child
But, tear it down
Tear it down

Yes, step back, Jack, from the darkness
Oh, while I'm here
I'm gonna sing just like a songbird
