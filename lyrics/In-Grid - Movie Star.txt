Break my heart
Break my hands
You can take anything but my plans
Ooh ooh I got big things to do

You can laugh,
Have your fun
I'll be standing right here when you're done
Ooh ooh I got big things to do

Just because you don't see us
Doesn't mean that we don't exist
Sometimes the smallest light
Shines so bright
Yeah, sometimes the smallest light shines so bright

I got heart, it's enough
It's the only thing left that they can't pull apart
And when they try, I'll fly

I can't win, there's a cost
You can't lose what you've already lost
Ooh ooh I got big things to do

Just because you don't see us
Doesn't mean that we don't exist
Sometimes the smallest light
Shines so bright
Yeah, sometimes the smallest light shines so bright

Ooh ooh ooh ooh (but I)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (can be)
I've only just begun (to see)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh (but I)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (can be)
I've only just begun

Just because
You don't see us

Just because
You don't see us

Just because
You don't see us

Just because
You don't see us

Just because you don't see us
Doesn't mean that we don't exist
Sometimes the smallest light
Shines so bright

Ooh ooh ooh ooh (but I)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (can be)
I've only just begun (to see)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh (but I)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (can be)
I've only just begun

Only just begun
Only just begun
