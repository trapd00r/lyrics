I'm Andy Cole's tortured soul lost out again in front of goal
I wish I had your cocaine confidence
Some girls are easier on the eye but could you take the silent lives
I wish I had your full on arrogance
But I'm a white witch, mad bitch, hooked on drugs the jury's out, the lawyer shrugs
The angel on my shoulder falls asleep
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
I thought I was Columbus, turns out Antarctic Scott
And I always ate my friends along the way
But don't ask about the reasons nor reason with my aims
The closer you'll appear the less I'll say
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Silent fool but give me time and I might prove, I could do anything I choose
I'm Andy Cole's tortured soul lost out again in front of goal
I wish I had your cocaine confidence
But I'm a white witch, mad bitch, hooked on drugs the jury's out, the lawyer shrugs
And all the wine you had just left me sober
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
(Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep)
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me
(Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep)
Do you believe in me or are you leaving me . . .
(Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep)
Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep x 2
Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep x 2
Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep x 2, etc.
Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep
Drink puts the angel on my shoulder to sleep
Drink puts . . .
