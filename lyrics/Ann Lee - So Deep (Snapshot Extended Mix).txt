Now if you leave me there's no way to stop you
If that's the way things have got to be
Remember this - it's the love that I gave you
You'll try to say that you cared for me.

Oh - if you leave me don't ever regret it
'Cause there's no playing with destiny
Oh - you say enough but you've got to have meant it down deep.

Because you feel so deep
Oh yes you feel so deep
There's nothing left for me
Because you feel so deep.

Well if you go there is no way to argue
If that's the way that your mind is made
I feel the sadness of knowing I failed you
But that won't change a decision made.

Oh if you go just look back on what I told you
That if you're gone there's no turning back
Oh you say enough it's because love is cold so deep
