Pink:
Shadows are fallin' all over town
Another night and these blues got me down
Oh misery ... I sure could use some company

(Steve Tyler):
Since YOU'VE been gone
(Both)
I ain't been the same
(Steve Tyler):
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain
(both)
Guess it's all meant to be ... for love to cause me misery

Pink & Steven Tyler:
Oh, misery ... Oh, misery ...
Tell me, why does my heart 

(Pink)
Make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny,
for love to cause me misery

Pink & Steven Tyler:
And Oh, I've been down this road before
(pink)
where the passion it turns into pain
(both)
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I'd never get caught up again

Pink:
But ain't it true ... It takes what it takes
And sometimes, we get too smart too late

Steven Tyler:
One more heartache for me

pink and Steven Tyler:
Another night in misery

Pink & Steven Tyler:
Misery ... Misery ...

Pink
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?

Pink & Steven Tyler
Misery ... Misery ...
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?

Pink:
Seems it's my destiny,
for love to cause misery

Steven Tyler In The Backround
Misery... Misery...

Pink
Guess it's all meant to be,
for love to cause me misery
