Kelly, Can you handle this?
Michelle, Can you handle this?
Beyonc√©, Can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this!

Barely move, we've arrived
Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly
Baddest chick, chick inside
DJ, Gemini
Spotted me attentive thang
There you are, come on baby
Don't you wanna, dance with me
Can you handle, handle me?

You gotta do much better
If you gonna
Dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you gonna
Dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully
If you like what you see

You can handle me
By the looks I got you
Shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt,
It's time for takeoff

Bootylicious for ya babe

Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you
Can handle this

I'm about to break you off
H-Town going hard
Lead my hips,
Slap my thighs
Swing my hair,
Square my eyes
Lookin' hot,
Smellin' good
Groovin' like
I'm from the hood
Look over my shoulder,
I blow you a kiss
Can you handle,
Handle this

Ready for this jelly

Move your body
Up and down
(Whoo)
Make your booty
Touch the ground
(Whoo)
I can't help but
Wonder why
(Whoo)
Is my vibe too
Vibealacious for you,
Babe

I shake my jelly
At every chance
When I whip
With my hips you
Slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can
Handle all this jelly
That I have
Now let's cut a rug
While we scat some jazz

(Scatting)

I don't think you
Ready for this jelly
I don't think you
Ready for this jelly
I don't think you
Ready for this
'Cause my body too
Bootylicious for ya babe
