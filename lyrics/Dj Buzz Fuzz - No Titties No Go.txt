Stinky weather, Fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, Grumpy gnomes
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepytime, Bashful but nude
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

I getting that

Enter Galactic, see me to be you
It's all in the tablets, Sneezy Bhutan
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

Little wonder
You little wonder, you
Little wonder
Little wonder you

Seding me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

Little wonder
You little wonder, you
Little wonder, little wonder
You little wonder, you
You little wonder, little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
