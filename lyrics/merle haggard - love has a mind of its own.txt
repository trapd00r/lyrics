I'd love to forget every time that you kissed me
I'd love to forget that you're gone
I'd gladly hold back each tear that I'm crying
But love has a mind of its own

Love is the ruler, the greatest of kings
Love sits up high on a throne
Forgetting you darling is not my decision
For love has a mind of its own

I don't wanna carry this worrisome heartache
I don't want to cry all night long
I wish I could run from the day that I met you
But love has a mind of its own

Love is the ruler, the greatest of kings
Love sits up high on a throne
Forgetting you darling is not my decision
For love has a mind of its own
Love has a mind of its own
