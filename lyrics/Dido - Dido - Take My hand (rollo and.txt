Touch my skin, and tell me what you're thinking
Take my hand, and show me where we're going
Lie down next to me
Look into my eyes, and tell me
Oh tell me what you're seeing

So sit on top of the world, and tell me how you're feeling
What you feel now is what I feel for you
Take my hand, and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you

See my eyes, they carry your reflection
Watch my lips, and hear the words I'm telling you
Give your trust to me
And look into my heart, and show me
Show me what you're doing

So sit on top of the world, and tell me how you're feeling
What you feel is what I feel for you
Take my hand, and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you

Take your time, if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
You believe me

Feel the sun on your face
And tell me what you're thinking
Catch the snow on your tongue
And show me how it tastes

Take your time

Take my hand, and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you

Take your time, and if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
You believe me
