Run, oh Molly run, run, oh Molly run
Tenbrooks gonna beat you, bright shinin' sun
To the bright shinin' sun, oh Lord, to the bright shinin' sun

Tenbrooks was a big bay horse, he wore that shaggy mane
He run all around Memphis, he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train, oh Lord, beat the Memphis train

See that train a-comin', it's comin' round the curve
See old Tenbrooks runnin', he's strainin' every nerve
Strainin' every nerve, oh Lord, strainin' every nerve

Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
Come back to old Kentucky, got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease, oh Lord, beat with all ease

Kyper, Kyper, you're not a-ridin' right
Molly's beatin' old Tenbrooks, clear out of sight
Clear out of sight, oh Lord, clear out of sight

Kyper, Kyper, Kyper my son
Give old Tenbrooks the bridle, let old Tenbrooks run
Let old Tenbrooks run, oh Lord, let old Tenbrooks run

The womens all a-laughin', the children all a-cryin'
Mens all a-hollerin', old Tenbrooks a-flyin'
Old Tenbrooks a-flyin', oh Lord, old Tenbrooks a-flyin'

Go and catch old Tenbrooks and hitch him in the shade
We're gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready-made
Coffin ready-made, oh Lord, coffin ready-made
Let old Tenbrooks run, oh Lord, let old Tenbrooks run
