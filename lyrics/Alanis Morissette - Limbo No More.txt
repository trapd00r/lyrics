My house 
My role 
My friends 
My man 
My devotion 
to god 
All amorphous 
Indefinite 

Nothing's been clear 
Nothing's been in 
Nothing's felt true 
And I've never had both feet in 
Nothing's been long 
Nothing's been yes 
Nowhere's been home 
And I'm ready to be limbo no more 

My taste 
My peers 
My identity 
My affiliation 
All amorphous 
Indefinite 

Nothing's been clear 
Nothing's been in 
Nothing's felt true 
And I've never had both feet in 
Nothing's been long 
Nothing's been yes 
Nowhere's been home 
And I'm ready to be limbo no more 

I sit with filled frames and 
My books and my dogs at my feet 
My friends by my side 
My past in a heap 
Thrown out most of my things only kept what I need 
To carve something consistent and notably me 

Tattoo on my skin 
My teachers in heart 
My house is a home 
Something at last I can feel a part of 
A sense of myself 
My purpose is clear 
My roots in the ground 
Something at last I can feel a part of 

Something aligned 
To finally commit 
Somewhere I belong 
Cuz I'm ready to be limbo no more 
My wisdom applied 
A firm foundation 
A vow to myself 
'Cuz I'm ready to be limbo no more.
