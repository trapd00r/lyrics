Thank you st. jude
Left intact and brought back, a little lees than before
A little less inclined to credit where credit's due
(Help me help myself) a patron saint of a thousand stitches
(Help me help myself) a restoration made without me
(Help me help myself) a witness to my own recovery
All owed to you st. jude
