Baby I got love for you
And I appreciate the things you do
But I got no reason to stay
Cause somehow
We don't seem to work it out
And baby ain't it what it's all about
Think I gotta take a break

Trying to figure out
Where we be ending up
I have to follow my intuition
Make a dicision
Just for a while I have to let it go
I have to follow my intuition
Make a dicision

I'm taking a road trip
Trying forget you
City to city but it all
Reminds me of you
I pull down the window
Feeling the wind blow
I need to breathe in something new

All we do is fight
We never work it out
No need to look
Into the rearview mirror
The only thing that's right
Is for us to divide
No need to look back
In the rearview mirror

After all that we've been thru
Girl I can't stay mad at you
I just can't stay mad at you
Cause I've been getting
Pictures in my head
On how I used
To dry those tears you shed
Still I got to make a move

Trying to figure out
Where we be ending up
I have to follow my intuition
Make a dicision
Just for a while I have to let it go
I have to follow my intuition
Make a dicision

I'm taking a road trip
Trying forget you
City to city but it all
Reminds me of you
I pull down the window
Feeling the wind blow
I need to breathe in something new

All we do is fight
We never work it out
No need to look
Into the rearview mirror
The only thing that's right
Is for us to divide 
No need to look back
In the rearview mirror

I'm taking a road trip
Trying forget you
City to city but it all
Reminds me of you
I pull down the window
Feeling the wind blow
I need to breathe in something new

All we do is fight 
We never work it out 
No need to look
Into the rearview mirrow
The only thing that's right 
Is for us to divide
No need to look back
In the rearview mirror
