Now his intentions unfold, they're not what they seem,
He only wants to take control. 
Boy is he selling you loads, all you do is believe, 
Grant him his black-eyed fantasy. 
He claims that he knows you, says it's written in the stars, 
Do you believe this bullshit? 
Tell me you don't want to face this situation any more than I do
Oh you think you're so great, keep it up at this rate, 
You're bound to catch it if you wait. 
I've seen the symptoms before, they come as they please, 
Here comes the low rent man again, 
He claims that he knows you, says it's written in the stars
Will you believe this bullshit? 

Tell me you don't want to face this situation any more than 
I do. 
So what does he have in store; does he need you to bleed? 
Inadequate in all he breathes, 
He claims that he knows you, says it's written in the stars, 
Will you believe this bullshit? 
If you don't want to face this situation any more then I don't.
