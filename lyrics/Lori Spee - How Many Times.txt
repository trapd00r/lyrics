How many times will you fall
And stand alone with your back to the wall
How many times will it take
Till you crawl out from behind your mistake

How many points did you win today
How many times will you grow up all the way
What is it you want to hear from me
Don't think of running out of sympathy

I don't know what you expected I can't get into your shoes
The minute you decide you're gonna take that ride
There's a change you might win but then again you might loose

I never said it be easy not ever gave guarantees
The things you have to do are mostly up to you
And I wouldn't stop you I couldn't even if I tried

Come on and give me that smile
I like to think you are worth my while

How many points did you win today
How many times will you grow up all the way
What is it you want to hear from me
Don't think of running out of sympathy

You don't get something for nothing they don't give it away
You want to do what's right you got to stand and fight
And don't pay much attention to the empty things they say

Life can be something you suffered
Something you can endure
When I combine the two I still come up with you
Standing before me with fire in your eyes

Come on and give me that smile
I like to think your worth my while

How many points did you win today
How many times will you grow up all the way
What is it you want to hear from me
Don't think of running out of sympathy

How many times will you fall
And stand alone with your back to the wall
How many times will it take
Till you crawl out from behind your mistake

How many points did you win today
How many times will you grow up all the way
