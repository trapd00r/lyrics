Come all you fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court young men
For they're like a star on a cloudy morning
First they'll appear and then they're gone

They'll tell to you some loving stories
And they'll swear to you that their love is true
Straight away they'll go and they'll court some other
And that's the love they have for you

Don't you remember our days of courting?
You told me then that you loved me best
You could make me believe with the falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the west

If I had known before I courted
I never would have courted none
I'd have locked my heart in a box of golden
Fastened down with a silver pin

So come all you fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court young men
They're like a star on a cloudy morning
First they'll appear and then they're gone
