Get up and shake it off
It's time that you listen up
And hear the call

There at the water
But at night you're on fire
Back against the wall

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to give it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Just get closer, you'll find yourself a lover

When you know you're alive
Then next time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you're alive
Then next time, take it slow
'Cause you'll need height

Hold on to what you've got
And strike while the arms help put up a fight
Those days are gone and gonna keep up
Keep on going strong out through the night

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to give it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Just get closer, you'll find yourself a lover

When you know you're alive
Then next time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you're alive
Then next time, take it slow
'Cause you'll need height

Feels like the latest version
Now that the winds is turning soft and cool
Next up a new dimension
Find something fresh
And someone just for you

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to give it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Just get closer, you'll find yourself a lover

When you know you're alive
Then next time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you're alive
Then next time, take it slow
'Cause you'll need height
