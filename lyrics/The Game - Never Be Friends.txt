Yeah though I walk through the valley of death
Vest on, Teflon none approached in my Hurricane sweats
Black chrome my shoulder, big wheel till it's over
He never got to see me put black chrome on the Rova
Reading your obituary wishing we never met
So I wouldn't have to shed tears or wake up in cold sweats
Lookin' at this bottle of Hennessy wishing you never left
Wishing I chased your Monte Carlo down and gave you my vest
Or better yet I wish they never let you out
And I never got that phone call tellin' me that you out
Wish you never signed the release form
I wouldn't have had to clear this sample
Or use this track to say rest in peace for him
You wanted to know if Dre and Em felt you?
They did, before I could tell you somebody killed you
I feel pain for everybody that ever knew the real you
Call Nas tell him that I got an Ill Will too

Niggas politickin' wanna know why I'm rhymin' different
My best friend got murdered, nigga my mind is different
If you ain't never spent no time in prison
You can't understand these bars or the lines I'm spittin'
Niggas rilin' me up let's go find a victim
I can't do it homie that's the reason Shyne in prison
And through divine intervention ten plus years doing crime in the trenches
Multiply by the time we spent in the kitchen
It's a life worth of hard livin', Cuban cigar tippin'
Twelve grade ditchin', purple serve by the jar sippin'
If you lost a homie you know friendship is God given
I've done seen the church so much you'd think I was born Christian
I've done seen more dead bodies than a mortician
Seen niggas in and out of county blues like they was born crippin'
So I'ma keep on livin' 'cause when I'm gone niggas ain't gonna do shit
But fuck my bitch and poor liquor

What if you was me
And you had to sit through an entire funeral
While the Pastor readin' your homeboy's eulogy
I'm already dead
What the fuck you gonna do to me?
Keep talking shit I'll empty my clip in that G-Unit tee
Gimme a minute to say my grace with God
I'll see your face in the mirror I came a long way to talk
And tell you your Moms is missing you
Your Pops is missing you
Just saw your baby pictures in your Grandmother's living room
Face is missing you homie
Wink is missing you
Thank God you left us memories and songs to listen to
??? Is missing you
The hood is missing you
Let my son graduate high school
And I'm gonna come visit you
The world is missing you
Eminem was feeling you
Dre said he felt your vibe the little time we spent with you
Pour the Henny out 'cause he ain't here in the physical
They say real men don't cry but nigga I'm missing you
