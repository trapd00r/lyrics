Maybe see you later
Maybe catch you then
Now it's complicated again

Psychalogical defense

I hope my heart's resistant
You critical desease
If you pull my cover you will
Be infecting me


Forgive but not forget
Let's start over, let's regret
Let's forgive we never tried
Let's start the fight inside

Forgive but not forget
Let's start over, let's regret
Let's forgive we never tried
Let's start the fight inside


Every one keeps falling [down]
Everywhere you go
Every one is nothing
Every one is lying on the floor
[Hey! Wake up!]

But I like it like it
But I like it love it
But I like it liking to me
Do you like in me? 


Forgive but not forget
Let's start over, let's regret
Let's forgive we never tried
Let's start the fight inside

Forgive but not forget
Let's start over, let's regret
Let's forgive we never tried
Let's start the fight inside


[Hold me now] 
Hold me 
Hold me now
Hold me 
Hold me now
Hold me 
Hold me 
Hold me 
Hold me now
[Hold me] 
[Hold me]
Hold me... 


Forgive but not forget
Let's start over, let's regret
Let's forgive we never tried
Let's start the fight inside

Forgive but not forget
Let's start over, let's regret
Let's forgive we never tried
Let's start the fight inside

Forgive but not forget
Let's start over, let's regret
Let's forgive we never tried
Let's start the fight inside
