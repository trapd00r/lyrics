Chorus(2x): 
What y'all want me to do 
Keep your shit the hardest 
It's about to go down 
Niggaz is ready to start this war that's for sure 
Nigga come and get it 
Ride and die why 
Cause my niggaz is wit it 

I want Monopoly money but I ain't even half way there 
Do a dirt and a nigga gotta take the backway there 
What it is is the biz and its dirty 
You'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty 
Take the business to the hallways, driving up for four days 
On parole with warrants that'll send me back the raw way 
If I get caught across Jersey state lines 
Figure this 98 and I been runnin since 89 
So that's like 9 years delinquent time 
You speakin crime than you know 
9 years you owe it's not 9 years you gonna go 
No probation or parole more time doin nothin 
They roam to yard writin rhymes an frontin 
Carry niggaz greasy because I'm built like that 
Burry niggaz easy cause they get kilt like that 
If you ain't in it wit me than you in my way 
But either or you will respect mine 
And leave tech 9 and leave it for dude 
The realest you gonna feel is when you face your death 
Sorry I didn't know nigga don't even waste your breath 
Coppin pleas not D why you flippin 
Nigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slippin 
Letin a nigga catch you when I got my gaurd down 
So I keep em up 
Noddin of with one eye open 
I can it freak but theres a time when i'm close 'em both 
Lead poisonin i'm a get hit with an overdose 
So I don't drug thing crud thangs 
Think I don't know a slug stains, or blood blaze 
Raw gun playin drama 
Sadness to another niggaz momma 
I'm a be the the one that puts you up inside the trauma 
These are troublesome times 
And the crime prevails 
And the dark side keeps a niggaz ass in jail 
Bada-boom-bada-bing some of this and some of that 
Gotta boogie for a minute but you know i'm coming back 

Chorus(2x) 

Try to show niggaz but I can only hope they see 
You a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3 
Layin' up like this 
Lips sewn shut eyes closed 
Niggas walk past the casket damn shorty nice pose 
You was ballin nigga till your ass got balled out 
Called out by some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out 
I bet you thought it was real funny 
Until it had to get cruddy 
Me walkin off leavnin you with all this bloody 
What he gonna do when it's all over for real 
And the last thing you see is that steel 
A blast of light that's what he seein' if you blast him right 
Hit him in the face and hear that closed casket tight 
Get it right it aint nothin but endin it to a nigga 
Street sweeper like ahhhh! 
Sendin it to a nigga 
When you in the house you play by house 
2 words you'll never here again are house lose 
And that's house choose it aint gonna be that 
Cause I can't see that 
Ready to get in them niggaz ass real good so where the weed at 
Believe that you aint going to see nothin to familiar 
I would tell you what to do but than I'd have to kill you 
And it ain't even worth it I ain't goin to build nothin 
So I'm just gonna let you go be that same nigga 
still frontin laughin and shit 
Like you see somethin funny but you say sound good 
let me see somethin money 
For real 
(Go nigga, go nigga, go nigga, go nigga, nigga)
