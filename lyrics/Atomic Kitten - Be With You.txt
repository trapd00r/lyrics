(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)

Liz:
You and I
Two of a kind
A meeting of minds
The time of our lives
The perfect night
Out of sight
As I look in your eyes
Never felt so right

All:
I really want tonight to last forever 
I really wanna be with you
I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you

(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)

Natasha:
Night and day (Night and day)
Come what may
There's always change, nothing
Stays the same (Nothing stays the same)
Who can say? (Who can say?)
What will come our way
Leave it all to fate
Let tomorrow wait

All:
I really want tonight to last forever 
I really wanna be with you
I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

Liz:
You know I really wanna be with you
You know I really wanna be with you

Natasha:
The perfect night 
Out of sight 
As I look in your eyes 
Never felt so right
Ooh yeah 

All:
I really want tonight to last forever 
I really wanna be with you
I really want tonight to last forever 
I really want tonight to last forever (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really want tonight to last forever (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)

I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you (Tonight, yeah)
I really wanna be with you...
