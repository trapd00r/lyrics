Fifteen years ago, the American public was introduced to Marshall Mathers, Eminem, and Slim Shady, a triptych of manic personalities whose interests included raising hell, making enemies, and sticking nine-inch nails through each one of their eyelids. To commemorate Shady being set loose upon the world, we've decided to rank every single song Em has released to date

But first, allow us to qualify our countdown with a few rules of eligibility: We only included songs that were given an official retail release â€” that means tracks featured on studio albums, EPs, and compilations, plus guest verses; we didn't consult mixtapes or unofficial freestyles, so we offer our deepest apologies to "Nail in the Coffin," "Til Hell Freezes Over," and other noteworthy rarities. Skits weren't considered, either (condolences to all the Ken Kaniff and Steve Berman die-hards out there). Obviously, we only considered D12 tracks that featured a verse or hook from Eminem. And, finally, if there were multiple versions of a track, we opted to include the rendition we thought superior, so don't expect to see the live Grammy performance of "Stan" or The Slim Shady EP's "Just the Two of Us." And with that, we begin the Eminem show...
