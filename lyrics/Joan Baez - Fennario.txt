As we marched down to Fennario
As we marched down to Fennario
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
They call her by name pretty Peggy-o

What will your mother think pretty Peggy-o?
What will your mother think pretty Peggy-o?
What will your mother think when she hears the guineas clink
The soldiers all marchin' before you-o?

In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o
In a carriage you will ride with your true love by your side
As fair as any maiden in the are-o

Come skippin' down the stair, pretty Peggy-o
Come skippin' down the stair, pretty Peggy-o
Come skippin' down the stair combin' back your yellow hair
And bid farewell to sweet William-o

Sweet William is dead, pretty Peggy-o
Sweet William is dead, pretty Peggy-o
Sweet William is dead, and he died for a maid
The fairest maid in the are-o

If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o
If ever I return all your cities I will burn
Destroying all the ladies in the are-o
Destroying all the ladies in the are-o
