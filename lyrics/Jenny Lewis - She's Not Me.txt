I used to think you could save me
I've been wandering lately
Heard she's having your baby
And everything's so amazing
It goes on and on and on and on
It goes on and on and on and on

But she's not me, she's easy

All those times we were making love
I never thought we'd be breaking up
Bet you tell her I'm crazy
It goes on and on and on and on
It goes on and on and on and on

But she's not me, she's easy

Remember the night I destroyed it all
When I told you I cheated
And you punched through the drywall
I took you for granted
When you were all that I needed!

But she's not me, she's easy
She's not me, she's not me
She's easy, she's easy
She's not me, she's not me
