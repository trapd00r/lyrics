Intro Jam

[Verse 1]
Back that ass up now, back it on up
Back it on up now, I feel it's on something good
Back me up, boys, feel that you're there, now
Feel that you're there. just there in my back here and I said
When it's down I know it's down I know when it's light out and it's up
When it's down you know it's down
I said I need to know what's up
When it's down you know it's down now
Someone to return now
I don't even know, but I feel it in my heart
Back it on up boy, back me on up
I'm gonna face the dark man, just back me on up
He's white as a ghost with a tie and a suit
He thinks that he's got me on the corner of his shoe
Just back me on up, boys, back me on up
I know when I'm down, but I don't know what's up
So, back me on up, boys, back me on up
And by the time this is over I'll see the sun, come on

[Verse 2]
When it's around and I know the town
And I think I know every way out
And I think I know where I get to
I'm giving myself up to you now
Some kind of faith, some kind of faith that you
Back me on, back me on
Back me on up, boys, back me on up
They say I don't know when things are up
I know what's down 'cause I live there, you know
And I think it's pretty 'cause I see the soul of
Backing on up, girls, back me on up
I like it on earth, I like it in the dirt
Oh, and my feet get my heels pretty
I know that it snows like
Oh, roses
Back me on up, boys, back me on up
I gotta face some kind of evil tomorrow
I need to know that you're gonna be there
And you know my faith is in your hands
Now just back me on up, just back me on up
Back me on up
"Haha-ha!"
"One, two..."
"...three!"

Marys of the Sea

[Chorus 1]
Hey, I am not in your way
Hey, no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
Last time I checked, he came to light the lamp for everyone

[Post-Chorus]
"Relax love," he said before he left
"Take those hands away from your eyes
From where I stand, you're in my sky"

[Verse 1]
You must go, must flee for they will hunt you down
You and your unborn seed
In all of Gaul is there safety?

[Pre-Chorus]
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
You will dance the ring
Marys of the Sea
The lost bride weeps
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
We will dance your ring

[Chorus 2]
Hey, there's a new Jerusalem
Hey, you built on rock that's on sand
For now you have hijacked the sun
Last time I checked, he came to light the lamp for everyone

[Post-Chorus]
"Relax love," he said before he left
"Take those hands away from your eyes
From where I stand, you're in my sky"

[Verse 2]
I hear a voice and it says
"The red of the red rose is its own
And something no man can divide"
So Saint Germain hear the prayer of this supplicant
For two scarlet women, Black Madonna

[Pre-Chorus]
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
You will dance the ring
Marys of the Sea
The lost bride weeps
Les Saint Marie de la Mer
We will dance your ring

[Chorus 3]
Hey, I am not in your way
Hey, no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
I know it's your day in the sun

[Chorus 1]
Hey, I am not in your way
Hey, no need to push me again
I know it's your day in the sun
Last time I checked, he came to light the lamp for everyone
