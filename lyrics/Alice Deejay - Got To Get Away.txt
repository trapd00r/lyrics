I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I was afraid I kept my feelings inside
We shared our love and the thing
But in the end you took a ride
You didn't come back to me I shut my tears along
It crushed my heart cause you are never coming home

Emotions swept away to nothing at all
Those were the days that I was loosing control
You got me burning it will never get the same
You just let me standing in the rain.

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

Emotions swept away
I'm loosing control
You've got me burning up
I've got to let you go

Emotions swept away
I'm loosing control
You've got me burning up
I've got to let you go

I've got to get away
I've got to get away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away

I've got to get away
I've got to move away
