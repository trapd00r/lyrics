We're not the first, hope we're not the last
'Cause I know we're all heading for that adult crash
The time is so little, the time belongs to us
Why is everybody in such a fucking rush?

Make do with what you have
Take what you can get
Pay no mind to us
We're just a minor threat

We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat

I was early to finish, I was late to start
I might be an adult, I'm a minor at heart
Go to college, be a man, what's the fucking deal
It's not how old I am, it's how old I feel

Take your time
Try not to forget
We never will
We're just a minor threat

We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat

That's a promise
