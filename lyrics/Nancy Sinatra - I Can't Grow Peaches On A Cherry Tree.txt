I have tried to make you love me 
I've done everything your way
And I'm crying for the words you'll never say
You think love is an illusion
That must end in sad conclusion
If that's what you feel that's just how it will be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

When I see the peaches blossom
I'll regret I said goodbye
I remember cherry kisses and I'll cry
But I can't go on pretending
That our love is never ending
For you can't be loved unless you want to be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree

Someday I will find a new love
But for you there can be no love
For you can't be loved unless you want to be
And I can't grow peaches on a cherry tree
