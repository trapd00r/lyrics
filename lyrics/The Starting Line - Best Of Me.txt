Tell me what you thought about when you were gone 
And so alone 
The worst is over 
You can have the best of me 
We got older 
But we're still young 
We never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up 

Here we lay again 
On two separate beds 
Riding phone lines 
to meet a familiar voice 
And pictures drawn from memory 
We reflect on mis communications 
And misunderstandings 
And missing each other too 
Much to have had to let go 

Turn our music down 
And we whisper 
"Say what you're thinking right now"

Tell me what you thought about when you were gone 
And so alone 
The worst is over 
You can have the best of me 
We got older 
But we're still young 
We never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up 

Jumping to conclusions 
Made me fall away from you 
I'm so glad that the truth has brought back together me and you 

We're sitting on the ground and we whisper 
"Say what you're thinking out loud"

Tell me what you thought about when you were gone 
And so alone 
The worst is over 
You can have the best of me 
We got older 
But we're still young 
We never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up 

Turn our music down 
And we whisper 
We're sitting on the ground 
And we whisper 
We turn our music down 
We're sitting on the ground 
The next time I'm in town 
We will kiss girl 
We will kiss girl 

Tell me what you thought about when you were gone 
And so alone 
The worst is over 
You can have the best of me 
We got older 
But we're still young 
We never grew out of this feeling that we won't 
Feeling that we can't 
That were not ready to give up 

We got older, but we're still young 
We never grew out of this feeling that we won't give up
