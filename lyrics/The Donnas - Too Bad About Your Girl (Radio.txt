Waitin' all night not a call in sight
I got the bait but I got no bite
Wanna have some fun, wanna have someone
Who can make me feel alright
I'm lookin' at you, you're lookin' at me to
Yeah you know what I wanna do
But your girlfriend wants the night to end
Baby tell me somethin' new

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight 
Cause you're lookin' like you're the one

She left but now she's back
Stickin' out her rack
She got you runnin' down the wrong track
Can't wait to see her face when I'm in her place
And I'm tryin' to get you in the sack

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight
Cause you're lookin' like you're the one

Tell her to leave soon it'll be too late 
It's like New Year's Eve cause I just can't wait
Too bad, (you've got a date tonight) too bad about your girl
Yeah it's too bad, (you've got a date tonight) too bad about your girl

If you were smart you'd sent her home on B.A.R.T.
Before the real trouble starts
Cause who's she gonna slap when she sees me in your lap
And you say you had a change of heart
I gotta make you mine
But we're runnin' outta time
She's got you guarded like the Guggenheim
It's all that I can take
Let's make a jailbreak
Or we'll be doin' time in Anaheim

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight
Cause you're lookin' like you're the one

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight
Cause you're lookin' like you're the one
