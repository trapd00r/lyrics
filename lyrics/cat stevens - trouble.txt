Trouble oh, trouble set me free.
I have seen your face and it's too much, too much for me.

Trouble, oh , trouble can't you see?
You're eating my heart away
and there's nothing much left of me.
I have drunk you wine.
You have made yours worth mine
so won't you be fair?
So won't you be fair?
I don't want no more of you
so won't you be kind to me
so let me go where,
I want to go there.

Trouble
Oh, trouble
move away
I have seen your face
and It's to much for me today.

Trouble, oh, trouble
can't you see?
You have made me a wreck
now won't you leave me in my misery?
I have seen your eyes
and I can see Death's disguise
hangin' on me, hangin' on me.
I am beat and torn,
shattered and tossed and worn,
too shocking to see
too shocking to see

Trouble, oh, trouble
move from me
I have paid my debt
now won't you leave me in my misery.

Trouble, oh, trouble
please be kind.
I don't want no fight
and I haven't got a lot of time.
