Tumble out of bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life

Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin'
For folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin'
And no givin'

They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me 
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream
Just a watch 'em shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away

In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day
Your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn
And it's all gonna roll you away

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin'
And no givin'

They just use your mind
And you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5, yeah, they got you were they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

9 to 5
Oh What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin'
And no givin'

They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life
And you dream about it don't  you
It's a rich man's game

No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet
9 to 5
