Strange rhythm running through my vein
I try to stop my feet but I've got
Strange rhythm, got strange rhythm

Strange feeling seem to take me
Strange feeling, seems to make me miss
Seems to make me miss a beat
Strange feeling deep within my soul
I try to understand but I've got
Strange feeling, got strange feeling

Strange rhythm seem to take me
Strange rhythm, seems to take me
Strange rhythm, seems, seems to make me
Makes me miss a beat
Strange, but I can't help the feeling
Strange, I feel, I feel, I feel
Strange, maybe you can hear a
Strange rhythm, Strange

Strange rhythm, I feel, I feel, I feel
Strange rhythm, I try to understand but I've got, I've got
Strange feeling, stange but I can't help the feeling
Strange, I feel, I feel
Strange, maybe maybe you can hear a
Strange
Strange
