Slipping down a slide, 
I did enjoy the ride, 
Don't know what to decide,
You lied to me
You looked me in the eye
It took me by surprise
Now are you gratified
You cried to me

LaLaLaLaLaLa

Don't turn around,
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad I'm not sad, it's casting over,
It's just one of those things you'll have to get over it.

When I was feeling down, you'd start to hang around,
And then I found your hands all over me,
And that was out of bounds, you filthy rotten hound,
It's badder than it sounds, believe me,

LaLaLaLaLaLa

Don't turn around, 
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face,
Don't make this worse, 
You've already gone and got me mad,
It's too bad I'm not sad it's casting over,
It's just one of those things you'll have to get over it.

Hey you! you gotta get over, hey you!, you gotta get over it.
It's too bad I'm not sad it's past and over,
Just one of those things you'll have to get over it.

Aaaw-oh 

Don't turn around, 
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face,
Don't make this worse, 
You've already gone and got me mad, 
Don't turn around, 
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face,
Don't make this worse, 
You've already gone and got me mad,
Too bad I'm not sad it's past and over,
Just one of those things you'll have to get over it.
You'll have to get over it.
