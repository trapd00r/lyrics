Before shots, Queens, you heard, I'm a Florida boy
But I'm gonna shout y'all niggas out
'Cause I got number one love for New York, niggas, you heard?

I love niggas, I love niggas 'cause niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot through shit
And to all niggas that do it, I love

To all my Brooklyn
(Niggas)
To all my Uptown
(You niggas understand?)
To all my Bronx
(It's war, nigga)
To all my Queensbridge
(I'll blow you away)

Back up, chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin' weed, flippin' ki's, makin' crazy Gs

Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots on the avenue
Take my loot and I'm baggin' you
Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet in her pantyhose

Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out and blow they motherfuckin' back out
That's a real nigga for ya

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'

When we smoke spliffs, we pack four fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery
Rough very not your ordinary, we watch you get buried

That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. 'cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway

Up Northbound, first stop, Watertown and fish scale
Where the hand scales are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover, doo doo stain remover
Yo, G, pass the buddha

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'

When I was young, my M.O. was to go hand in hand
And even my P.O., she called me the 'Ginger Bread Man'
I cut ya new case and tell her ass catch me if you can
Don't let your people feel you're awkward, I tame, I'm not lame

Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. Style, watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North Seed Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off propa

There's no place like home, New York, New York
I run this city and now I dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama, really

Pushy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics like Milli Vanilli
Even the hood, they feel me, I'm on fire
Niggas out in Philly, they feel me, they bump my shit
Even bootlegged, you know, bump my shit, bitch

We the realest, nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G., my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie, yo' nigga, 50, yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigga, leave a nigga fo' sho'

I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Twizzy's in this bitch with Obie Trice
So watch what you say before you call our name
If you say one more thing, it won't be nice

Here we go, I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jealous of us to love us
You ain't it, G-Unit made it and Obie's comin', D-Twizzy's comin'
You sick to your stomach

50 percent is 50 Cent
The other 50 percent is who's color skin it is
Well, if you're even considering takin' our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin' to get too intricate into it

I'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates into some other shit
Then I'ma flip, then I'ma get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one

It's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me

Thinkin' they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggity dock diggity

Mixed with a little bit of the jiga jig jiga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records
We the label fo' sho'

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your people
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50
We gon' kill yo' fuckin' label fa sho

Shady in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes to rock the mic, right?
Still watch what you say to me punk
'Cause I'm off probation in less then 6 months
