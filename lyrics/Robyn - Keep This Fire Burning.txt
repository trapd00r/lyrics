All right'

Even when you don't know
I'll be by your side
Even when you think you're all alone
I'll be by your side (hey oh)

I'll be right behind you, keep on goin'
In which ever way the wind is blowing
I will be there till the world stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning

When nobody else is
I am on your side, oh yeah'
Baby when you're not even yourself
I am on your side (oh)

I'll be right behind you, keep on goin'
In which ever way the wind is blowing
I will be there till the world stops turning
Baby I will keep this fire burning fire

Yeah ooh all right

Even when you lost your faith in love
Even when there is no light above
Even when you wanna run and hide, yeah'

How far I'm about to go

Ain't nobody stoppin' me
When it comes to you and me
When nothing's like it used to be

Baby I will keep this fire burning
For you'
