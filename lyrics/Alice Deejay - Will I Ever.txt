Nananana

I don't dare to let it show,
Therefore you will never know.
What I really feel inside,
and how I lay awake at night.

(Chorus:)
Will I ever fall in love,
and if I do will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love,
and will you be the one for me?

Will I ever fall in love,
and if I do will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love,
and will you be the one for me?

Nananawheho nanana nananawheho
Nananawheho nanana nananawheho

I guess it all in my head,
and I will be alone instead.
Dreaming of a night with you,
and all the things that we would do.

(Chorus)
