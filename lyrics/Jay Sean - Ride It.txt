(Let me feel you)

It's been about a month and twenty days...
And we're going round and round jus playing silly games...
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now...
Then ya wink at me and walk away..

let it be, let it be, let it be known...
hold on, don't go...
Touching and teasing me, telling me no...
But this time I need to feel you...

[Chorus:]
(Ride it) we're all alone...
(Ride it) just lose control...
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride) let me feel you...

(Ride it) turn the lights down low...
(Ride it) from head to toe...
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride) let me feel you...

Movida was the club on the Saturday...
ya actin like a diva sayin you don't wanna pay...
it's gotta be ya fiesty style ...
raised eye brow...
i love it when you look at me that way...
now we're in-you order a Mohito at the bar...
ya re-apply lippy cos it came off on the glass...
the DJ plays ya favourite song...
Kanye's on...
now ya beckoning for me to dance...
mmmm... pullin me, pullin me, pullin me close...
just close your eyes girl...
whispering, tellin me we gotta go...
won't you take me home i want to ride it

[Chorus:]
(Ride it) we're all alone...
(Ride it) just lose control...
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride) let me feel you...

(Ride it) turn the lights down low...
(Ride it) from head to toe...
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride) let me feel you...

Everything was right until her phone began to ring
She takes it to the corner that's when I start wondering
I can hear her shouting, banging fists against the door
Yelling yo it's over I can't take it any more
Then I walk away and act all nonchalant and cool
i ain't tryna get all caught up in her mess for real
But she came on out and backed me up against the wall
She said I know you heard but I'll make you forget it all.
(music)

baby let me feel you...

[Chorus:]
(Ride it) we're all alone...
(Ride it) just lose control...
(Ride it, ride it) come touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride) let me feel you...

(Ride it) turn the lights down low...
(Ride it) from head to toe...
(Ride it, ride it) touch my soul...
(Ride it, ride) let me feel you...
