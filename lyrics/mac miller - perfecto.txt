Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's lurking
Who really has the time at all
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I know so fine
But really I'm bugging bugging making something out of nothing

Yeah, as harder it gets, cool, calm and collected
Holding my breath this ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out of my chest
The cards are all on the table I'm calling it
Don't say it I swallow it
When living off the borrowed time
Often I'm on the fence on a line
Adding up what's on my mind
My feet on the clouds, head on the ground
That we going down bet you know me now

No threat in water I swear
If I drown I don't care
They calling for me from the shore I need more

Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's lurking (is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?)
Who really has the time at all (is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?)
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I know so fine
But really I'm bugging bugging making something out of nothing

It feel like the weekend on the Tuesday
I can move days
Its "I got something else to do" day
Always do hate, If I do say
The D'USSE with the homies like it's Kool Aid
Me, I'm just trying to play it cool J
Yeah, mind over matter I'm
Purer than alkaline
Bitch stuck on album time
I gotta get out to shine
Fly on the wall, shit I was bugging
Miss me like you getting withdrawal I keep that coming, yeah

I'm threat in water I know
If I start moving I flow
They nothing knew
Just play it cool baby, just play it cool
You know, cool

Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's lurking
Who really has the time at all
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I know so fine
But really I'm bugging, bugging, making something out of nothing

Yeah, tell me you love me spend me around
Pretty please pick me up in the air and don't put me down
You seen it all, I fall you sat back and watch
Knowing time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop
Bare feet, running late, her car is started
Even though the only thing that she driving, a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order
Perfect
