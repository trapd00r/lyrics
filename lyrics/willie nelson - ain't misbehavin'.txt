No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

I don't stay out late, don't care to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

I don't stay out late, don't care to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Savin' my love for you
Savin' my love for you
