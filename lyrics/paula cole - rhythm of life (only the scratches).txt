To the critics and the cynics who don't understand the lyrics
To the atheists and the pessimists
Wanting company in their darkness
You may see me as a fool,yes, a charlatan, an egotist,
But I'd rather be this in your eyes
Than a coward in His

I began as Isis, the high priestess
My arms stretched to Sirius, me, the serpent Venus
Awaken the fetus, fertility to Jesus
Come and meet us (you are the seed in us)

Looking within I can see beyond my sight
The cities, the sky, the planets roll by
I awake and I die, yeah, I awake and I die, yeah
This is the rhythm of life

Next I was lightning, God energy fighting
To tell my widow surviving I was still alive in
Another place of life n' I struck him seven times
He finally looked to the sky
Shed a tear and joined me dying

Looking within I can see beyond my sight
The cities, the sky, the planets roll by


I awake and I die, yeah, I awake and I die, yeah
This is the rhythm of life
Rhythm of life, rhythm of life, this is the rhythm of life

Now I am me, in diffident lead, responsibility
Trying to face my fear, from the trailer park to here
Over mountains, through my death
From Harbinger to Amen
May my actions outweigh my words
May my lifetime be of worth

Looking within I can see beyond my sight
The cities, the sky, the planets roll by
I awake and I die, yeah, I awake and I die, yeah
This is the rhythm of life

All the word's a stage,
And all the men and women,
merely players
They have their exits,
And their entrances
And one man in his time,
Plays many parts.
