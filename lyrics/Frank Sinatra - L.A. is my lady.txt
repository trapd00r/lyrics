The music she moves to, is music that makes me a dancer
I brought her my wildest of dreams, and she came up with the answer
I leave behind a part of myself, whenever I leave her
But oh, when I'm back in her arms
She smiles and then - I am home again

'Cause L.A. is my lady
She's always there for me
L.A. is my lady
She knows how to care for me
No lady's sweeter - you know it the moment you meet her

I've been in love more times, than I care to remember
And love's kept me cool in July and warm in December
It may not have lasted, but each time I thought it was heaven
You name it, I've been there and back
Lookin' for someone who - I'd be faithful to

L.A. is my lady
She's always there for me
L.A. is my lady
She knows how to care for me
She's good to me - yeah she's good to me

And that's why
L.A. is my lady - L.A. is my lady
And you're lookin' at a man who - doesn't ever plan to
Kiss his lady bye-bye
