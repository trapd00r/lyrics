There's a picture on my wall
A crack in the ceiling
Cigarette burns in my hall
I get the feeling

That you surround me
That you surround me, mmm

If I died a thousand times
My soul washed beside me
I will never be alone
You're always inside me

And you surround me
And you surround me

(solo)

You surround me
And you surround me

And you (surround me) surround me
And you surround me (surround me)

And you (surround me) surround me (surround me)
And you (surround me) surround me

And you surround me
And you surround me
And you surround me
And you surround me

aah. aah. aah. aah. aah. aah.
