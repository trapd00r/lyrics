Lee:
Walking down some cobbled street
the sound of water near my feet
I found her
A hundred thousand flashes in my mind and soon my arms were all around her

We lay and let our hearts take wings and fly across the scene
Love came pouring from the sky pretending it was rain
Oo-oh Paris Summer

Nancy:
Standing on some cobbled street
the sound of water near my feet
He found me
I took the wedding ring off of my hand before he put his arms around me

I lived my lie and dreamed his dreams and laid beside the scene
When I left the tears I cried he thought were just the rain
Oo-oh Paris Summer

Nancy: Walking down some cobbled street, the sound of water near my feet
Lee: I found her
Nancy: I took the wedding ring off of my hand
Lee: Before I put my arms around her
We lay and let our hearts take wings
Nancy: And fly across the scene
Lee: When she left the tears she cried
Nancy: He thought were just the rain
Lee: Oo-oh Paris Summer
Nancy: Whooo-oa Paris Summer
