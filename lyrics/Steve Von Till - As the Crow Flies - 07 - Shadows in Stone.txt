[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine
Oh, oh, oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh yeah! oh, oh! Sweet child of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet child of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Uh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Sweet child...
Where do we go now?
Ay, ay, ay ay, ay...
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Sweet child
Sweet child o' mine
