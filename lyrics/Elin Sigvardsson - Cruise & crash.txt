I have been across the border,
I've tasted earth and blood. 
I've seen rain touch the water on dislocated spots.
I've been losing my head, yes I've lost my mind, 
So will you save me in the end from telling all these lies? 
Of course you will and I'll be misunderstood. 

You cruise, I crash. 
You slide, I smash. 
You're fire and I'm ash.
I won't even ask you why.

I am bound to inspire, 
But I'm tired of my own brain.
Seven hours of entire ridiculous pain.
There are strangers inside my aura and my sphere.
I guess I've lost the fight ' but you're still there
And you will shine again, 
And I'll be misunderstood.

You cruise, I crash. 
You slide, I smash. 
You're fire and I'm ash.
I won't even ask you why.

You will shine again and I'll be misunderstood

You cruise, I crash. 
You slide, I smash. 
You're fire and I'm ash.
I won't even ask you why.
