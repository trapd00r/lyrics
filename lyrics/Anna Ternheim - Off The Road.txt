Off the road somewhere I don't know
Soon with you, it's gonna blow
In your car for hours and days
weeks and months, windows rolled down

Pass small cities and big ones too
I brought one promise, not one for you
We drive fast, sunsets low
Wanna reach the sun, before I get old

Deserts and fields, and the pine trees
Music my father played me when
I was a child just like now
I never once thought that feeling could die

Those days came and went
Then you get taken by life by accident
And you wake up somewhere in the shade
Overloaded by what you made yourself
Have to get the things, the ring, the mind, the wing, the smile and you're going

And I say, off the road, somewhere I don't know
just as long as I feel it blow
Deserts and fields, and the pine trees
Music my father played me when
I was a child, just like now
I never once thought that feeling could die

Mmmm, that feeling can die.
