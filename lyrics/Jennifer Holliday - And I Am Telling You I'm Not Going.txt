And I am telling you I'm not going
You're best man I've ever known
There's no way I can ever go
No no there's no way
No no no no way
I'm living without you

I'm not living without you
I don't wanna be free

I'm staying
I'm staying
And you - and you
You're gonna love me

You're gonna love me

And I am telling you I'm not going
Even though the rough times are showing
There's just no way - there's no way

We're part of the same place
We're part of the same time
We both share the same blood
We both have the same mind

And time and time
We've had so much to share
No no no no no no
I'm not waking up tomorrow morning
And finding that there's nobody there

Darling there's no way
No no no no way
I'm living without you
I'm not living without you
You see there's just no way - there's no way

Tear down the mountains
Yell, scream and shout
You can say what you want
I'm not walking out

Stop all the rivers
Push, strike and kill
I'm not gonna leave you
There's no way I will

And I am telling you I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever ever go
No no no no way
No no no no way
I'm living without you
I'm not living without you

Not living without you
I don't wanna be free

I'm staying
I'm staying
And you - and you - and you
You're gonna love me

You're gonna love me
Yes you are

Love me - love me - love me
Love - love - love me

You're gonna love me
