There's no time when I’m feeling fine
There’s no time when I feel alright
All the time I’m just fighting days
So much time that I can’t explain
Are we really here just a little wheel…
In everlasting sadness, turning really
Unimportantly… I’m sorry again
Oh, no I swear I’m not doing it ever again
Oh, no I swear… again
Million things are now turning back
Millions of them I can’t explain
Mornings start to sound so bad
A day conquered – then I’m glad
I’m trying to make my oasis of stability
In this everchandin’ world
Reality is laughing at me…
No one ever wins
Oh, no I swear I’m not doing it ever again
Oh, no I swear… again
I take my comic book, put my radio on
I dream about you, I fantasize a little room
Where nothing can go wrong
Oh, no I swear I’m not doing it ever again
Oh, no I swear…
And it’s a neverending story
So much time I said I’m sorry…
