People are like songs, it's true. Some seem dull 
at first, but then they grow on you. Me, I'm like 
Can't get you out of my head. Annoying at 
times, but I make you want to dance. But you 
are the only one I've met who's God only 
knows. I liked you the first time I met you, and 
it grows, and grows, and grows. 

People are like songs, I swear. Some found you 
as a child, and still they're always there. A boy I 
once knew was Anarchy in the UK. Burned out 
too quickly, but in such a beautiful way. And 
you are the only one I've met who's God only 
knows. Such a well thought out-plan, but with 
harmonies that flow. 

People are like songs, I've been told. Some will 
claim your ears, but you never hear a story 
unfold. Old radio gaga, or your high school 
friends remind you of things, when you were 
someone else. And God only knows and you 
paired up as two. As the turn of the seasons, you 
come and go. I can never claim control of either 
of you, you're too sweet to be just mine alone. 
And I try to stay humble over the fact that 
sometimes, when the time is right you will pass 
my door, the crescendo comes and God only 
knows and you have this one sad similarity that 
every time it's over, I want to press play again 
but the only difference appears to be I can force it 
on one of you, and on the other I can't.
