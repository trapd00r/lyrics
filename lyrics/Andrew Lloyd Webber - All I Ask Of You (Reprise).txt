[Christine]
I must go, they'll wonder where I am
Come with me Raoul...

[Raoul]
Christine, I love you...
(They kiss)

[Christine]
Order your fine horses
Be with them at the door!

[Raoul]
And soon you'll be beside me...

[Christine]
You'll guard me and you'll guide me...

[Phantom]
(Picks up Christine's rose)

PHANTOM
I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
and now, how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you
When he heard you sing!
[whispered]
Christine...
(The Phantom begins to cry)

(offstage)
CHRISTINE/RAOUL
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime!
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...

[Phantom]
(Climbing the statue)
You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom asked of you!

GO!
(chandelier falls)
