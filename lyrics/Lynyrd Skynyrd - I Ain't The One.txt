One, two, three

Now I'll tell you plainly baby, what I plan to do 
Say I may be crazy woman, but I ain't no fool 
Your daddy's rich mama, you're overdue 
Now I ain't the one baby, been messin' with you 
Got bells in your mind lady, and it's easy to see-uh 
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe 

Aww, you're tryin' to put a hook in me, baby, oh, no

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me 
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me 
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one 
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun 
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh 
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe 

Time for me to put my boots out in the street missy 
Are you ready boots?
Walk on!

Well now alright there missy, 
Let me tell you a thing or two
How about it baby?

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me 
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me 
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one

Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh 
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe  

Oh, I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy

Ohhh, nooo!

Wooooo!
