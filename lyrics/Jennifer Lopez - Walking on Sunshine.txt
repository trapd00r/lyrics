I can't wait, wanna see
How this night is gonna be
Just a touch, away
From a feelin' that is here to stay

Bridge:
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of our world, I'll be waiting
for you to be all mine

Chorus:x2
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I

Take my hand, close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that Make me cry
Catch my tears, with a kiss
These special moments do exist

Bridge

Chorus

M8
Let's take a chance and try love baby
No I'm not giving up
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life
Until the end of time.....(I,I,we can make it last)(x2)
