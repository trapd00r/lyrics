Was There something she could have done now?
Was this just a part of the play?
Or is this the inevitable crash
When couples loose their intimate flame
No warning of what was to come no
Or were eyes shut refusing to see
In their life, it uesd to be them two
All of a sudden, they're three

Look at me now and tell me everything's the same
And you and i will always stay together
This is all in vain
Look at me now, look at me now

The truth came divided in portions
Slowly painting a picture of shame
Merciless she realised their reality
Was never the same
So two worlds collapsed at the same time
Though in very different ways
Two minds in total disorder
One with shame. the other with hate

Look at me now and tell me everything's the same
And you and i will always stay togerther
This was not in vain
Look at me now, look at me now

Time went by and they slowly recovered
After endless days filled with pain
Both reliving their life once together
Over and over again
When  spring came in all its glory
And heaven took over hell
They happened to meet once again
And you know, things in life seldom happen in vain

Look at me now and tell me everything's the same
And u and i will alwas stay together
This was not in vain
Look at me now, look at me now.
