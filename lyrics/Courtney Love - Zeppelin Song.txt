Will you accept a collect call
From Robert Plant?
We picked him up on Vine
On a bus bench singing that song he will not stop
This is not the first time
He was so cute (yeah yeah)
Jonny Punk Rock, so cynical
You woulda jumped him too
But now the song remains

Why are the burners always toast?
Why are the stoners always stoned?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
The Zeplin song

I got a job minimum wage & a tabledance 
He drinks my beer and plays guitar
He's on my bed wasted every night when I come home
Play the same 'ol lead again & again..

Sometimes I gotta say shutup
Sometimes I gotta say so what
I don't think that it's so punk
What's with the Zeplin song

Sometimes I gotta unwind
Sometimes I gotta hide
Sometimes erase and rewind
I gotta throw the trash out
He's buying a stairway to hell 
Yeah that is him
Playin' the same old zeplin song again & again & again & again & again & again

I'm a guitar
A Les Paul single cut away
Please don't play that song on me again
I'll explode
I'll break all my strings and start playing shit
Like the Sex Pistols or anything
Son House or the Blues

Why does he rain on my parade?
Why does the song remain the same?
I can't remember my own name
I work for minimum wage
Oh go tell it to Jimmy Page
At the crossroads with the deal he made
Cuz that song ain't goin' away
Oh God the Zeplin song
No no the Zeplin song
Here comes the Zeplin song
Oh God the Zeplin song
SHUT UP!
