&lt;I need a new kind of medicine
I need a new (oh love)kind of medicine
(a-ah, oh yeah)
One don't hurt so much
Ain't so damn tough
It makes me feel so good all over
Something baby
About your love don't work for me
And I've been thinking
How bad your loving makes me feel
Turning me around and around
Back and forth and up and down
Always thought you'd be good for me
But lately it's been killing me
And I need someone
To fill me with sweet ecstasy
And I need someone who can take me high
And set me free(c'mon set me free)
Leaving me alone at night
You never want to sacrifice
Now I know you're no good for me
Now I got to find a remedy
Chorus:
I need a new kind of medicine
I need a new kind of medicine
I need a new kind of medicine
One don't hurt so much
Ain't so damn tough
It makes me feel good all over
Tell me baby
How could things change so soon
I gave you everything
Nothing was to good for you
Love should feel like
A warm healing deep inside
But I feel I'm slowly dying
&gt;From sitting alone crying
And I need someone
To fill me with sweet ecstasy
And I need someone who can take me high
And set me free(c'mon set me free)
Leaving me alone at night
You never want to sacrifice
Now I know you're no good for me
Now I got to find a remedy
Repeat chorus
I need a new love, I gotta find a new kind
I gotta find a new kind of medicine
Repeat chorus to fade...&gt;
