People talk about you
I've got memories
There is something about you
I know what it is

How is your heart doing
Oh, they make me think of you
Nowadays, that feels good
Moments are coming back to me
But closer than they should

How is your heart doing
Where i'm not welcome no more
How is your heart doing
Just wondering, that's all

I was so young when i feel for you
It must have shaped my heart
But the youth is for the history
And life does need new starts

How is your heart doing
The one i was dying for
How is your heart doing
I'm wondering, that's all
