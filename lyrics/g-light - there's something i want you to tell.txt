Bad Love - That's all it was I wanted you from the start
And it took one touch - I couldn't get enough
But you fooled around and tore us apart

I was a fool - to believe it I guess - I was dreaming
Listening to all ot your lies Baby now - This you to know
That I'm over you this time were really through
And I'm never coming back I'm letting go

So cool - You broke every Rule Girl you really put on a Show
And now its too late - I just can't wait
I think there's something you ought to know

I've had enough - Of all your lying cause you can
Stop your crying
Baby you don't know what you've done and this Game
You've played is ending
Time to - Stop pretending now you'll be the lonely one

That I'm over you what you put me through
Now I finally see the light - I want you to know
That I'm over you this time were really through
And I'm never coming back I'm letting go

I was a fool To believe it I guess I was dreaming

Listening to all of your lies that I'm over you
What you put me through now I finally see the light - I want
You to know
That I'm over you this time were really through
And I'm never coming back I'm letting go

Baby now - This Game is ending no use - I pretending
Its Time for you to realize

That I'm over you want you put me through
Now I finally see the light - I want you to know
That I'm over you this were really through
And I'm never coming back
I'm letting go
