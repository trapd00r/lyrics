Between the open heart
And a whisper goodbye
There's a perfect teardrop in your eye
Between the lover's moon
And the trembling sky
There's a broken dream in your mind

And the voice is carrying the love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yeah, the voice is carrying the love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark

Between the careful touch
And the breakaway kiss
There's a beauty you can't resist
Mmm, between the fall apart
And the moment of bliss
There must be something more than this

And the voice is carrying the love you have lost
(Love you have lost)
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yeah, the voice is carrying the love and the scars
(Love and the scars)
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
In the dark

Hear the lonely voice in the dark
Hear the lonely voice in the dark

And the voice is carrying the love you have lost
(Love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yeah, the voice is carrying the love and the scars
(Love and the scars)
Hera the lonely voice in the dark

Oh yeah, the voice is carrying the love you have lost
(Love you have lost)
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yeah, the voice is carrying the love and the scars
(Love and the scars)
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
In the dark

Lonely voice
Lonely voice in the dark
Hear the lonely voice
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
