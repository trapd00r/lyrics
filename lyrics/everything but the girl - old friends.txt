Not for the first time I look back
on all those years
Not for the last time names will ring
in my ear
When there was just a gang of us
Storming the town by train and bus
A moment of thought this heart sends
to old friends

Not for the first time I look back
on my first love
Unable to speak or think or move
hand in glove
But what of it now and where is he
He who once meant so much to me
Because we are not, I can't pretend
now old friends

I was told love should hold old friends
I was told love should hold old friends
But when you leave you will close the door
behind you
Don't we always
And time won't make amends
to old friends

Standing here with my arm around you
life's moved on
And all its borderlines
are being redrawn
The winter has come the roads are white
Everyone's home late tonight
May we stay or will it depend
as old friends
In the end still old friends
