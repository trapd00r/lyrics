Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love

Take these arms that were made for loving
And this heart that will beat for two
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you
And I've been such a long time waiting
For someone I can call my own
I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming, now I'm home
I need your love like night needs morning, so won't you...

Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love

Take these lips that were made for kissing
And this heart that will see you through
And these hands that were made to touch and feel you
So free your love, hear me I'm calling, oh won't you...

Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love
Oh baby, come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love

I need your love like night needs morning, oh baby...
Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love
Oh baby, come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love
