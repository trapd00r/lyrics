coulda sworn I was dreamin, for her I was Feenin, so I hadda take a little ride, 
back tracking ova these  few years, tryna figure out wat I do to make it go bad, cuz
Ever since my girl left me, my whole life came crashin and

outta my life, after all I put u thru u still stuck
Around and stayed by my side, what really hurt me is I broke

Really wanna make things right, cuz without u in my life girl
