You stand up like you just fell down 
Swimming up river like you know how to drown 
And you pave the way 
With all your proper nouns 

You genuflect when you should take a rest 
Bowing to the east and fast asleep in the west 
You could change your mind 
With the heart in your chest 

Just drop out 
Go for a drive 
Like your daddy used to do 
In 1965 
And you can listen to the radio 
All the way to San Francisco 

A lost pause is all that you found 
Peeking round the corner for a singular sound 
And you stop to talk 
When you hit holy ground 

The graveyard doesn't care for your type 
When you're eating your bananas way before they get ripe 
And you peel that green skin 
And call your guru on Skype 

Drop out 
Go for a drive 
Like your daddy used to do 
In 1965 
And you can listen to the radio 
All the way to San Francisco 

Drop out 
Hitchin' a ride 
Like your daddy used to do 
Before he swallowed his pride 
But you can listen to the radio 
All the way to San Francisco
