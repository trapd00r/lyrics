Been working out
Thinking maybe
You might start to like me
When we're hanging at the beach
And reading a lot
So you think that I am smart
And when you talk to me
I might have something to say
And when everyone is dressing up and going out
I'm feeling a little off
I get so extroverted
But only when no one else is looking
It's not working out
When you only see me out
I'm never feeling quite myself
Head is always somewhere else
But you're looking sharp
You're always looking so sharp
I'm trying hard to keep up
But you're leaving me behind
When everyone is dressing up and going out
I'm feeling a little off
I only feel cool when I'm sliding
Across the kitchen floor
In my slipperiest socks
But you're always shining
Without ever trying
You're always shining
You're the only one that I see
I get so extroverted
But only when no one else is looking
