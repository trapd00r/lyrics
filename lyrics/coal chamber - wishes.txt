When we wish, we wish for two
And when I wish, I wish for you
Yes, they come, and then they go
But I'm still left, here on my own

[Chorus]

When I wish  (I wish for you)  (repeat)
I wish for you...

When they wish, they wish to fly
Mask myself and don't know, why?
How Mary wishes on the ground
You please warm these with no sounds

[Chorus]...
...When I wish, "Can't this?"
...I can't do this, with you, anymore

Goodbye my sorrow
I save regrets for tomorrow  (repeat)

[Chorus]...
...I wish for you, (x3) ...When I wish
