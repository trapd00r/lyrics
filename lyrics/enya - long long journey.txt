City lights shine on the harbour,
Night has fallen down,
Through the darkness
And the shadow
I will still go on.

[Chorus]
Long, long journey
Through the darkness,
Long, long way to go,
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart that's coming home?

Where the road
Runs through the valley,
Where the river flows,
I will follow every highway
To the place I know.

[Chorus]

Long, long journey
Out of nowhere,
Long, long way to go;
But what are sighs 
And what is sadness
To the heart that's coming home?
