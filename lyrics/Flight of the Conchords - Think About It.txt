There's children on the street using guns and knives
They're taking drugs and each other's lives
Killing each other with knives and forks
They're calling each other names like "dork," wohoo, whoa

There's people on the street getting diseases from monkeys
Yeah, that's what I said, they're getting diseases from monkeys
Now there's junkies with monkey disease
Who's touching these monkeys, please
Leave these poor sick monkeys alone
They've got problems enough as it is

Man is lying on the street, some punk's chopped off his head
I'm the only one who stops to see if he's dead
Turns out he's dead
And that's why I'm singing

What, what is wrong with the world today
What is wrong with the world today, nteh, nteh, neneneh
What, what is wrong with the world today
You gotta think about it, think-think about it

Good cop's been framed and put into a can
And all the money that we're making is going to the man
What man, which man, who's the man
When's a man a man
What makes a man a man
Am I a man
Yes, technically I am

They're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers
But what's the real cost cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper
Why are we still paying so much for sneakers
When you got them made by little slave kids
What are your overheads

At the end of your life, you're lucky if you die
Sometimes I wonder why we even try
I saw a man lying on the street half dead
With knives and forks sticking out of his leg, and he said
"Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Can somebody get the knife and fork out of my leg, please
Can somebody please remove these cutleries from my knees"

And then we break it down
Yeah, ooh-ooh, this the acapella jams
Ooh-woo-woo, woo-woo, woo woo woo
Ooh woo, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, woo-oh, breakin' it down
Ooh, let me break it down

Jammin' out
Just jammin' out
Yeah, yeah
