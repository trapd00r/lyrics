Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam

We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down, now
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static sing it

Jam on 'cause Backstreets' got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreets' got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
We've got it goin' on for years

Well I'm creepin' up on your left straight up funky when I get with you
I get ruthless when I get wet keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype get up on this just to get right
What you want is what you gonna get Backstreets' got the special effects
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static sing it

Jam on 'cause Backstreets' got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreets' got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
We've got it goin' on for years

We've been waiting so long just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down now it's time for me to let it go
Time for me to let it go

Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam

Jam on 'cause Backstreets' got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreets' got it
Come on now, everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
We've got it goin' on for years
We've got it goin' on
