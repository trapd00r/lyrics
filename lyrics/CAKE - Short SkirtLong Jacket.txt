I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And-ah eyes that burn like cigarettes, ah

I want a girl with the right allocations
Who is fast and thorough and sharp as a tack
She's playing with her jewelry
She's putting up her hair
She's touring the facility and picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

I want a girl who gets up early (Gets up early)
I want a girl who stays up late (Stays up late)
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity (Uninterrupted)
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape

With fingernails that shine like justice (Hey! Ho!)
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass (Hey! Ho!)
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack (Hey! Ho!)
She is touring the facility and picking up slack (Hey!)
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na

I want a girl with a smooth liquidation (Smooth liquidation)
I want a girl with good dividends, ah (Good dividends)
At Citibank, we will meet accidentally (Meet accidentally)
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen

She wants a car with a cup holder armrest (Hey! Ho!)
She wants a car that will get her there (Hey! Ho!)
She's changing her name from Kitty to Karen (Hey! Ho!)
She's trading her MG for a white Chrysler LeBaron (Hey!)
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
