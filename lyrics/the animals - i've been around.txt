I've been around the world, it's true
Searchin' for someone... exactly like you
I finally found a love that's true

You heard my story, you heard just what I said
The one that I love... she might as well be dead
Finally found a love that's true, oh, oh, oh, oh...

You heard my story... you know how I feel
You got me spinnin'...like a spinnin' wheel
And finally found a love that true

I've been around the world, it's true
Searchin' for someone... exactly like you
And finally found a love that's true
And finally found a love that's true
