I sleep all day, out all night
I know where you're goin'
I don't think that's a-actin' right
You don't think it's showin'

A-jumpin' up, fallin' down
Don't misunderstand me
You don't think that I know your plan
What you tryin' to hand me?

Out all night, sleep all day
I know what you're doin'
If you're gonna a-act that way
I think there's trouble brewin'
