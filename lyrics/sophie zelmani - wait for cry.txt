If I am your stolen mind
It colud get back to you
Don't you think that's right

I don't know how hard you held me
So there must be a chance you haven't
Fully let go on me

If I am your sickness now
I wouldn't be od a kind
That would let you die

You haven't really told me yet
So it still must be fifty fifty
On what I'll get

If I am you question now
It could as well be a riddle
That only takes some time

Still the days are just passing by
Wait for rain, wait for cry

If I am your woon in where you're los
The trees could cease
For fields that's opening up

Still the day id letting me deny
I Wait for rain, I wait for cry
