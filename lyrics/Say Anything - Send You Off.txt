You ask me to do this again
I say I think I just date girls
And you're not a girl, right?
And you won't ever be one based on my insight
Actually I don't know how this works
This confusing spectrum
Of modern sexuality
I espouse it to my friends but it churns me

Mom loved me too much
And my daddy not enough
And I grew up nouveau riche
And I'm a slick son of a bitch

And I can't sustain
But I'll try if it numbs the pain
And I can't sustain
But I'll try if it numbs the pain

Because mom loved me too much
And my daddy not enough
And I grew up nouveau riche
And I'm a slick son of a bitch

Because Bowie's my excuse
So I can brag of how I tried
But all I want to do
Is send you off and get you high
And get you high
