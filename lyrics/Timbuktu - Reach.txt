Thinking's a headache - that's why we avoid it
thought reveals truth, and the pain of the facts thinking's; ache - that's why we avoid it
Reach for my hand,and i'll give you my soul

Man i-m running through life with blinders
avoiding the signs that are yelling out loud and clear that my time is runnin out quicker, though i'm clone with the liqour and i'm young and my ticker's still strong - it ain't long till i'm gone with a flicker 
My whole race is gone sicker DNA molecular structure like pieces of puzzles that ain't fitting my muscles degenerated, my semen's sedated from stress and toxic waste my whole being's mutated (my soul) 
Don't even mention my soul it's been gone for so long i'm feeling like a black hole 
I lost my religion, and lost touch with my inner self being consumed by the flames of a sinner's hell stumblin around in a state of mass (confusion) 
and i see no solution (confusion) 
but to turn up the music to soothe this (pain that i'm feeling)

I try to open my heart-find it hard to open my window tell large let's echo across the globe from the disco where people sing Julie driscoll (now i see rainbows of many more colours) 
In a world that's black and white you're taught to act your type like it's a fact of life avoiding the real facts - we spiral downwards inbreeding a bunch of spineless cowards 
Livin in an illusion we define as ours 
nationalism's that kind of prison we assign all power desperately clinging on to it until the final hour (i heard someone crying)
Well it was i,i-m feeling tired of lying and denying the obvious how we making like ostriches holdin ourselves as our hostages,adisgrace to philosophers and how we rather not think about it cus...
