From Jamaica to the world:
It's just love
It's just love, ahy

Why must the children play in the streets
Broken hearts and faded dreams
"Peace on Earth" to everyone that you meet
Don't you worry, it could be so sweet
Just look to the rainbow, you will see
The sun will shine till eternity
I've got so much love in my heart
No one can tear it apart, yeah

Be the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be the love generation
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon, ahy

Be the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be the love generation

Don't worry about a thing
Gonna be all right
Don't worry about a thing
Gonna be all right
Don't worry about a thing
Gonna be all right
Gonna be, gonna, gonna, gonna
Gonna be all right

It's all love, you know
It's all love
From I and I to everyone
Got to love, well we got to love, yeah
There's no need to cry-ah
Got to love, well we got to love, yeah
Got to live that love
You know what I'm talking about

Come on
Be the love generation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be the love generation
