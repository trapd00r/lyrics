Uh ya know what?
On the real
Uh

Me and you
We've been through
So much that we need to start off new
You need to choose
Don't be confused
I think it's time, time that you
Tell me the way that you wanna be with me, or be with her
This whole ordeal is such a blur
See I was prepared to take a loss
But my heart won't pay the cost
You don't know where you wanna be

You don't have to take my advice
You don't have to compromise
'Cause I know that you don't realize
You don't even see
Where you need to be

Be with them, all ya friends
Claim the clippers are playin' boston
I want a peace locket in seconds again
Do you want to play with me?
Or play with them?
Tell me where you wanna be in love
Is that enough?
When all the problems start adding up
Ladies raise your hands if you've had enough
Scream as loud as you can if you've had enough
'Cause he don't know where he wants to be

Why you say that baby?
It's all good show
Are you for real?
Common now
Don't talk like that

Hey I promise in all honesty
I honor you, you honor me
For better, worse, rich, or poor
Whatever it's gonna be
I'm talkin' bout forever more, for the rest of eternity
No need to be insecure
I know what I wanna be
I know I made a lot of mistakes
But I can make 'em all (make 'em all)
Unless you got your heart set on breakin hearts
If I can't see your face then my day ain't even worth wakin' up
Especially with these haters no put cases, this time enough
Maybe showin you attention is something I haven't done enough
But you got all my love on all our love
Girl, I need you to believe in me
You need to know that I know where I need to be, a
