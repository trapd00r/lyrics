I wannna know
The structure of your heart
Why did you tear
My broken soul apart
Is it a dream
Or my reality
Loved and without
After warranty

Ooh I want to runaway
You tell me nothing else but lies
I'm singin'
Ooh I try to runaway
'Cause I just want to live my life
I'm singin'
Ooh I want to runaway
As long you are by my side
I'm singin'
Ooh I try to runaway
But I can't find a place to hide

No I am not
Your fucking second choice
No I am not
Turnin' down my voice

Until you understand
There's nothing to command
Until you realize
That we can touch the sky

Can't you feel
Inside us control
Can't you feel
There's nothing at all

Ooh I want to runaway
You tell me nothing else but lies
I'm singin'
Ooh I try to runaway
'Cause I just want to live my life
I'm singin'
Ooh I want to runaway
As long you are by my side
I'm singin'
Ooh I try to runaway
But I can't find a place to hide
