[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
Uh.. uh.. uh, uh, uh
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know, so to me it ain't nuttin but bein true but
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
It doesn't have to be the way it is, you say it is
Just because for the past 20 years, every day it is
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
I wanna be able to walk out my front door
Without worryin about comin in conflict with the law, cause
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
If I follow Him, they'll follow me
And I'll speak life into the word that you can see
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
We get away with everyday shit, but everyday shit
catches up to you and when it does you can't say shit!
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
If I don't, you will, when I won't, you steal
What makes it feel like we gots to kill?
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
How many more lives must we lose?
How many more times must we choose to trust these fools?
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
I gave it to you straight don't mix it twist it up on some slick shit
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
I don't have to talk to it any more
I don't have to walk to it any more, I'm out the door [SLAM]
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
I wanna find peace with the Lord
I don't wanna find a beast with the sword, I can't afford to
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
When every day of my life
Is a constant fight between wrong and right
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
I thank you Lord for my life
Thank you Lord for keepin it loose when things got tight
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain, yeahh
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
Only I can stop, the rain, stop, the rain, yeahh - WHAT?
... GRRRR, only I (only I) can stop (can stop) the rain (the rain)
Only I can stop the rain, cause the rain falls on me
[singing] Now I know, only I, can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
