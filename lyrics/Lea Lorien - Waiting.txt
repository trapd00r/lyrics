(3x)
Gimme what I want
Gimme what I need

Don't feel like playing anymore
Don't want you calling anymore
Cause you made it easy to fall in and out of your love

You don't kiss me like before
We don't dance like before
Cause you made it easy to fall in and out of your love

If you can't gimme, gimme, gimme what I need
Then it's better that you leave
If you just want want want but you can't give
Then it's better that you leave

Don't feel like talking no more
Don't want you asking no more
Cause I've had enough of your cruel attitude

Can I get, can I get, can I get
Like the way it was
Can I get, can I get, can I get
Like when we used to fall in and out
In and out of love

If you can't gimme, gimme, gimme what I need
Then it's better that you leave
If you just want want want but you can't give
Then it's better that you leave

Gimme what I want
Gimme what I need
