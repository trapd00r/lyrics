Yeah, that's Funky
Funky
Yeah, that's Funky
Funky
Yeah, that's Funky
Funky

If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
Cause nobody's funky as us, 'cause we keep it stanky
Stanky
We keep it stanky,
Stanky
We keep it stanky,
Stanky
We keep it stanky,
Stanky
Stanky, stanky, stanky,

The Funk phenomenon, we Funk you on 'n' on
There's no need to hold your nose,
Cause this pong sing like a rose

Big Booty Funk, Toe jam Funk,
Underarm Funk, like you headlocking a Skunk'
Reeking like diseased athletes feet,
The stench didn't come till after this beat
Smellin' like drawers no weezin' no pause
Put your hand up on the speakers get smelly ass paws
You know we was coming before we entered the door
Cause you could smell the rhyme when we was walking down the hall
We bring the Funk worse than a wet dog
Stinkin' like fat ladies shittin' out logs
We drop enough shit to keep them toilets clogged
Keep the people jumpin' like them Bullfrogs
The first one who smelt it ain't the one who dealt it
Black Eyed Peas keep the scent blind like delta
Funky like onions you cryin' sure is Funky girl you ain't lyin'

If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
Cause nobody's funky as us, 'Cause we keep it Stanky
Stanky
We keep it stanky,
Stanky
We keep it stanky,
Stanky
We keep it stanky,
Stanky
Stanky, stanky, stanky,

Yo' you Funkin' with the Funk family
The non fabricated factual faculty'
We formulatin' up in a factory
Focusin' on the energid' of fluid flow free'
We flawless, everything is for free
We flourish and we flaunt our flavor freshly, huh'
Can you believe we flip the frequency's and
Freak emcees they leave all frantically but'
Our intent is ought to be friendly but'
They fightin' when we start the freestylin' frenzy
I conk up ya' flat till your girlfriend leave
Fillin all anatomy, bringin' me flattery, huh'
She'll be diggin these rhymes that ease beats
Like cellulite lyrics so flappy
We bring the funk to your festivity's
If you think something stank then it must be the peas!

If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
The funk funk full foul stinky and stanky stuff
If it smells like Funk it must be us
Cause nobody's Funky as us, 'cause we keep it stanky
Funky, Funky, Funky, Funky

Cellulite overweight stankin' emcees
Stench smells so strong it's insanitary
Cause you can sense me a mile away so janky
With the jungle Funk sound from Serengeti
Meaty, Fat, Nasty like miss fat booty's tights
Gettin' dirty like mudfights and dirtfights
Turning these drawers black they used to be white
And we shitin' on these tracks that you gonna' need to wipe
The odor's so contagious that it shows up in your dream
Man you could pick me out like food in between
Your 2 front teeth cause you be lackin' the streets
We got beefy ass beats that we bumpin' in the streets
We so nice 'n' sweet like steak box 'n' feet
Sour underarm Funk you ain't washed in a week
And man we be reekin' every day and weekend
We could all bounce to the Funk and the season

Bounce, bounce, bounce, woo, haha
Yeah that's Funky', Yeah that's Funky'

If you smellin' something funky
Then you know it got to be nobody other than APL, Will 'n' Taboo
'Cause if you know that if it smells like Funk then it must be us
If you smellin' Fat Funk then it must be us
If you smellin' something Funky
Then you know it got to be nobody other than APL, Will 'n' Taboo
Cause you know that if it smells like Funk than it must be us
If you smellin' elephants than it must be us
If you smellin' somethin' Funky
Then you know it got to be nobody other than APL, Will 'n' Taboo
Cause you know that if it smells like Funk then it must be us
If you smellin' elephants shit then it must be us.
