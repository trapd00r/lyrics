You´re baby´s going out
But she doesn´t wanna go with you
When the beat is loud
Then she wants to dance with someone new
She moves with the disco nation

But you shouldn´t lay the blame
Don´t point your hand in our direction
You shouldn´t play the saint
We always rocked your party

We didn´t start the fire
It was always burning since the world´s been turning
No, we didn't start the fire
No we didn´t light it but we tried to fight it

Oo-aa, oo-aa
Oo-aa, oo-aa

When your baby´s on the move
Don´t you blame it on the melody
It´s just another groove
Being laid out for the dancing feet
By this Alcazar DJ

So you should lay the blame 

We didn´t start the fire 

Everybody´s dreaming
Everybody´s screaming
Everybody´s steaming
on the night train night train
Everybody´s swaying
Everybody´s yeah-ing
Everybody´s playing
on the love game love game

You should lay the blame 

(We didn´t start the fire)

We didn´t start the fire  (x 2)

We didn´t start the fire
