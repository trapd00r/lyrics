You call me your friend, so you give me a name
I feel much stronger now that i have found
A place to be
It is nothing you see..
It’s nothing new but everything could change

You call me your friend, then you show me a way
To lose my fear so i could take a chance
And walk on through where i can barely stand
Thought i would break but i feel i could bend
...I feel I could bend

When you finally open the door
To let everything in
You’ll find out you’re not alone
And that you are someone to love

You call me your friend, you decide i can stay
To learn your faults and love you anyway
To see your world and all your secret fears
Reveal your beauty waiting to be seen
Or just to know what you mean...

When you finally open the door
To let everything in
You’ll find out you’re not alone
And that you are someone to love

When you finally open the door
To let everything in
You’ll find out you’re not alone
And that you are someone to love

And you don’t ever have to stop dreaming
And you don’t ever have to stop dreaming
...Someone to love

When you finally open the door
To let everything in
You’ll find out you’re not alone
And that you are someone to love
