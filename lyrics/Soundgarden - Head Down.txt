I see that smile
I see that smile
I see that smile on your face

We hear you cry
We hear you wail
I see that smile on your face

We see you laugh
We see you dance
We take that away every day

We see you cry
We turn your head
Then we slap your face

Bow down, bow down
Bow down, live your life
Head down, head down
Head down, hide that smile

Head high, head high
Head high, you've got to smile
Head high, head high
Head high, you've got to smile

I see you try, I see you fail
Some things will never change
We hear you cry, we hear you wail
We steal that smile on your face

Bow down, bow down
Bow down, live your life
Head down, head down
Head down, hide that smile

Head high, head high
Head high, you've got to smile
Head high, head high
Head high, a song you like
