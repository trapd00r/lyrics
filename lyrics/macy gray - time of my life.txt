When they come like left for day (When they're come and left for dead?)
I bet not in my head (I've been outta my head?)
And now I wanna be bigger, 
bein' here with you

It's not so hard to be
I can see (in?) my dream(s?) ,
I know I'm gonna be better
My friends alway say

My friends alway say..ey..ae.
That everything will be ok
But it don't always work out that way
So here I am again
Believing in, 'cause I remember when baby
I had the time of my life
Everything is right with you
After all that I've been through (yeah)
I ain't tryin' to lose
This times of my life, with you
Baby 

People say I'm outta line
So much on my mind
Like I wanna be bigger
Sometimes it don't rhyme

But when you're here with me (here with me)
I have poetry (poetry)
I know I'm gonna be better
And my friends alway say

My friends alway say..ey..ae.
That every thing will be ok
But it don't always work out that way
So here I am again
Believing in, 'cause I remember when baby
I had the time of my life
Everything is right with you
After all that I've been through (yeah)
I ain't tryin' to lose
This times of my life, with you
Baby 

One day they will see
It'll shine on at me (The giant baby?)
Finally see me smile, 
hear me laughing out loud 
My voice will be heard
It's no longer absurd
And I hope you hear
'cause Baby baby
I haaaaaaaaaaaddd...!

I had the time of my life
Everything is right with you
After all that I've been through (yeah)
I ain't tryin' to lose
Gotta make my move and groove
Everything I can 

I had the time of my life
Time of my life With You
Baby take my hand
Because I'm going to go on to
This time of my life with you
Baby
I had the time of my life
Time of my life with you
Baby
I had the time of my life
