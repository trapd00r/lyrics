7AM... thinking 'bout you
Wondering if the thoughts I'm feeling, you're feeling too
Like a new born child - soft to the touch
Baby is it possible to love someone so much?

I wish I may,
I wish I might
Be that certain someone
You wish for every night

If you knew what I knew,
You wouldn't say what you said
(Say what you said)
If you knew what I knew,
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady, yes
(My lady, yes my lady)
If you knew what I knew

(Ah, ah, ah .ah-ah, ah)

Time passes by
The only tears I cry
Are filled with disillusion and fears I have inside
Like a lost soul... I feel like I'm all alone
(All alone)
If only I could feel your pain within your heart of stone...

I wish I may,
I wish I might
Be that certain someone
You wish for everynight

If you knew what I knew,
You wouldn't say what you said
(Say what you said)
If you knew what I knew,
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady, yes
If you knew what I knew

Then you wouldn't have to go away
If you knew what I knew
(Ooh..)
Then you would be here... to stay
(...Alll)
Right by my side
(Ways)
Always

If you knew what I knew,
You wouldn't say what you said
(Say what you said)
If you knew what I knew,
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady, yes
(My lady, yes my lady)

If you knew what I knew my baby,
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead
If you knew what I knew my baby,
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead

(Girl if you knew...)
(Say what you said)
(...If you only knew)
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead
(Girl if you knew)
If you knew what I knew my baby
(Love you always)
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead
(Girl if you knew)
If you knew what I knew my baby
(Say what you said)
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead
(Girl if you knew)
If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby, we would be together instead
