Take it back to Saturday
I was in a k-hole
Laying out in the pouring rain
On and on and on, oh no
I could take the sky away
Put it in a payphone
Calling out all my mistakes
'Cause you don't know, you don't know

Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...
Don't stop making it happen
I can't take it no more
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...

You're the one who got away
And I just can't let go
How my mind keeps playing games
Dropping in before I drop out
Something 'bout that love we made
Put it in a payphone
Called you up, just had to say that
You don't know, you don't know

Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...
Don't stop making it happen
I can't take it no more
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...

All the boys come follow me
Come follow me from MYC
And all the girls on the internet
In your private jet, yeah getting wet
All the boys come follow me
Come follow me from MYC
And all the girls on the internet
Yeah getting wet, getting wet

Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for...
Don't stop making it happen
I can't take it no more
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for me

Don't stop making it happen
I can't take it no more
Don't stop making it happen
'Cause you're the only one for me
