Those who told us that life is a triviality, 
They are liars and couldn't care less about you and me. 
Don't demand me to stay cause I'm totally free 
And I'm gonna find shelter and tranquility.

May those people who blather he seized with remorse. 
I am proud and I'm gonna sit up on the highest horse. 
My sweater is itching, my shoes are too small,
gotta find a way out of this desert hole.

When I leave, no one needs to care about pretty little me.
When I leave, no one needs to ask, no one has to wonder where I am.

Those who walk across the borders and never get back, 
With their heads in the clouds and their essentials in a backpack. 
They will fall, they will rise, 
they will stand up again and they'll tell themselves: 'This is experience'.

When I leave, no one needs to care about pretty little me. 
When I leave, no one needs to ask, no one has to wonder where I am.
