He says his love for me
Could never die.
But that'd change if he ever
Found out about you and I.
Oh, but his love is cold
It wouldn't hurt him
If he didn't know, 'cause...
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch!

I'm gonna run to you!
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you!
'Cause when the feelin's right
I'm gonna run all night.
I'm gonna run to you.

He's got a heart of gold,
He'd never let me down.
But you're the one
That always turns me on.
You keep me comin' 'round.
I know his love is true,
But it's so damn easy
Makin' love to you!
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch!

I'm gonna run to you!
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you!
'Cause when the feelin's right
I'm gonna stay all night.
I'm gonna run to you.

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you!
Oh when the feelin's right
I'm gonna run all night.
I'm gonna run to you.

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you!

I'm gonna run to you!
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you!
'Cause when the feelin's right
I'm gonna stay all night.
I'm gonna run to you.

Yeah, I'm gonna run to you!
Oh when the feelin's right
I'm gonna run all night.
I'm gonna run to you.

I'm gonna run to you...
