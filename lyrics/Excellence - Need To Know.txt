All over the world
Lift up your voice
Do you know who you are?
Shout it loud, declare it
Believer's anthem, come on, let's go!

We are a chosen generation
We've been called forth to show His excellence
All I require for life, God has given me
And I know who I am
We are a chosen generation
We've been called forth to show His excellence
All I require for life, God has given me
For I know who I am

I know who God says I am, what He says I am
Where He says I'm at, I know who I am
I know who God says I am, what He says I am
Where He says I'm at, I know who I am
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am
