AMERICAN TRUCK


Allright Bob sing your song about the American Truck!
Oh you sing It! I got a headake today
Okay


I'm just a Cowboy from old Arizona
Don't live my life as they lived It In town
Cause everyday I be rising In the blue morning light
And I work til the sun Is going down

So when I'm out there and watching the cattle
I need a vehicle that I can trust
A steady Truck that Is good and safe and Is doing It's job
And that wont fall apart from muding rust 

I want a good ole American Truck! 
I could rely on the partner that will work around the clock
A car that always Is working hard without getting stuck
I want a good ole American Truck! 
Yea



Nobody can make a Truck like a yankee
I never buy me a slow Japanese 
Is gotta be heavy duty all American made
Just the Car you can trust in every piece

I wanna do a good job when I'm working
I wanna now that I'm worth what I'm paid 
I can be sure that the Job Is being properly done In the car that Is heavy duty made


I want a good ole American Truck! 
I good rely of the one that never ruins you out of luck!
The Japanese little monster flapping round like a Duck!
I want a good ole American Truck! 



SOLO



When you're a worker you gotta be trusted
You gotta have a reliable tool
You gotta use an equipment that Is quality made
Or you're land up just looking like a fool
I put my faith In my car every morning
I now It's run In rains snow and dust
Cause It's the Car that Is all over American made
That only Truck in the World that you can trust


I want a good ole American Truck! 
I could rely on the partner that will work around the clock
A car that always Is working hard without getting stuck
I want a good ole American Truck! 


I want a good ole American Truck! 
I could rely on the partner that will work around the clock
A car that always Is working hard without getting stuck
I want a good ole American Truck! 


A car that always Is working hard without getting stuck
I want a good ole American Truck!
