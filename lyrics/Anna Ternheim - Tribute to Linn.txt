Waking up was kind of strange
The past two years have made a change

You are barely on my mind
Saying goodbye sure takes time

Today you should turn twenty five
With your best time flying by
Not knowing where your future lies
And all prepared to conquer life

We get no answers from the past
No how the fire spread so fast

But New Year's Eve all turned black
Sometimes you're lucky
Sometimes you're not
