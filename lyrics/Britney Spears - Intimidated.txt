(spoken)
Ooh, I see you over there
Don't be shy
Come here, mm!

You got that thing that I can't deny
So move it over here, oh yeah!
You're giving signs that I recognize
Say what you want, oh yeah

Baby, there's something about you
Show me, that nothing can hold you down
Cause I, I must confess
I'm feeling you right now

CHORUS:
So, baby, take your chance
And show your confidence
Oh, baby, tell me who you are
You make my body scream
You make me believe
that you're what I'm waiting for
(Don't you be intimidated)

Just be a man
Show me where you stand
Positivity, oh yeah
I don't come off shy if you want me, babe
And if my E-G-O shows oh no, don't give up to fast

Baby, there's something about you
Show me, that nothing can hold you down
Cause I, I must confess
I'm feeling you right now

((CHORUS))

B-R-I-T-N-E-Y, uh, come on
B-R-I-T-N-E-Y

It doesn't matter boy
As long as you're diggin' me
So much we can be, whoa
Yes, it's true
At first you gotta make the move
For me to see what I want with you

((CHORUS 2x))
