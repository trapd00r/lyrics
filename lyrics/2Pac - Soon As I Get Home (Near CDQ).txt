Soon as I get home...

Soon as I get home...

Dear baby it's me
Again stuck inside this mad pen
Tryin' to pay my debt fpor all my sins 
These is penitentiary times
Be so heavy on my mind 
At times... it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell
Stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail 
Waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks 
And mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas is shady 
So I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin'... so crystal clear I see it
Even though you mad at me 
You'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come... so easily
I max out in the morning baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood 
Soon as I come home...

Garb my strap
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone
Soon as I come home...

Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin' 
But now you out in the world... while I'm twisted in prison
Love letters come daily
Words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures... beggin' for some sex 
Stay wide open keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it it real or you could die squealin'
Plus I never have to worry about a visit 
'Cause you're there daily
Gaurds tryin' to get your number
You don't dare tell me
Tongue kissin' steady humpin'
Tryin' to touch you somethin'
'Fore the C.O. in the corner jump in
Frontin'
Late nights reminiscin'
Everybody's queit
I think somethin's in the air 
Prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks
Steel from the bed springs 
I touch 'em with thug love
And then let they heads ring
Started a war but now I'm gone 
Release me to the streets in the morning
It's on 
Soon as I get home...

Grab my gats
Locate my comrades 
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe 
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone
Soon as I get home...

Kadafi

Since you've been gone 
My whole life's been like a game of c-low
Take and pick like they keep a c-note
Fillin' my dreams like Nino... Brown
The whole town be shook up
And me and mama survivin' 
Depends on how many rocks... the young nigga cook up 
Narcotics got drastic
Seen 'em niggas you blated 
Wantin' me in a casket
On the grind coppin' plastic
Yeah nigga I heard
Little Moo gave the word
You get parol on the third
It's all out we just heard 
We out here frontin' 
Still here but all about nothin'
My double o's what I'm wantin' 
And I'm tryin' to see somethin'
That we ain't never had
Luxury life results... livin' bad
Tricks of the trade 
Shit that should've been taught by dad
But learned through the crew 
Lessons between me and you 
And once we lock this shit down 
It ain't a thing they could do
Meawhile I stay waitin' by the phone 
Hopin' I get the call
Tellin' a nigga that you home...
