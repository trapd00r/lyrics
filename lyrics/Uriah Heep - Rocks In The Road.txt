When your world crashes down around you
And you have to face the sticks and stones alone
We need words to comfort and guide us
When we're somewhere on the road so far from home

And you know darned well, that it's just a little pain
There's nothing to lose, and everything to gain

Rocks in the road make us stumble and fall
Lights go down and we just can't see it all
But we rise back up and we stand up tall
Better than we ever were before

All the ways that you conceal your sadness
How it eats you when you just can't find the door
And you hide what's there behind your eyes
You can lead a heart to love but you can't make it fall

And you know darned well, it's just a little pain
There's nothing to lose and everything to gain

Rocks in the road make us stumble and fall
Lights go down and we just can't see it all
But we rise back up and we stand up tall
Better than we ever were before

When you look for a meaning
And the world that says so much to you
Unspoken feelings
They will never ever pull you through

When I look to the future
And the way the world will end
We have passion for each other
And we will witness love again
