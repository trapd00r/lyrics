Word to mother to my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards!
Holla back!
They be killing it know what I mean big boi!
Know wat I'm sayin'
Ayo!
Ayo Jodi!
Hey you can tell somebody to go downstairs
To the car and she get that bottle of Vouth
Out the back of the back for me baby I needa get right before
I do this here!

Ha

But me and you
Had to meet, talk,
Fuck, and get
Caught up
What we been through
Is enough to get intimate
Caught up
I'm feelin' you
And I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through
Just imagine what life be without me

Mami, I put my best foot forward
Though is kinda awkward
'Cause ya pigeon-toed and bold-legged.
But you ain't too proud to beg.
First time we got alone, you gave me some head.
And been callin me ever since
To do it again.
When we met you was a seventy straight with a ten
And I am ya lucky quarter
And the days get shorter
The nights get longer
You know when the weather is cold
Feelings get stronger
Wanna perform her
The pussy feel like walking pneumonia
Got me Snifflin, Sneezing, Coughin, and Aching and shit.
And I'm startin to think
I'm fallin' in love with this bitch.
I'm having dreams about her jeans
And how they fit.
And the Urban Jeffrey Baby Tee.
And she's wearing my name already
So you know she's fuckin' me.
I'm a G like that
But for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask
Myself is.

But me and you
Had to meet, talk,
Fuck, and get
Caught up
What we been through
Is enough to get intimate
Caught up
I'm feelin' you
And I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through
Just imagine what life be without me

Why me?
Betta yet why You and I?
Why I always pick the ones
Not in they right minds
And crazy.
Singing dangerously in love
This a dangerous broad I'm fuckin'
Like Al is the Scent of a Woman'
That got me playin' hardball
Like you'll couldn't.
Excuse my intruding.
I don't mean to be rude
But our situation is kinda amusing.
'Cause we both like each other
But scared of each other.
Is like we more than friends
And less than lovers.
And my niggaz can't tell us
What we been doin' is wrong
And you girls getting jealous
'Cause we been getting along.
Hold on!
This is how it all begins
You call your friends
I'll call my friends.
We'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion
At the Hamptons on weekends.
Then it all ends.
And the question is.

But me and you
Had to meet, talk,
Fuck, and get
Caught up
What we been through
Is enough to get intimate
Caught up
I'm feelin' you
And I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through
Just imagine what life be without me

Have you even been touched like I touch you?
Been held like I hold you?
Been loved like I love you?
Be Real. Be Real.
Have you ever been seen like I see you?
Been heard how I hear you?
Been felt how I feel you?
Be Real. Be Real.

Girl you're my
(Sunshine)
But sometimes it gets a little cloudy
Don't it?
Them sunny days
See the sunrise
And wish that it could hit you
Face it.
I'd be great
To get up every morning
To eggs and steak.
But you can't be late
So we separated on good terms
And no one's concerned
About who you been fuckin'
And who you fucked last.
But when I see ya
Still my question to ask is.

But me and you
Had to meet, talk,
Fuck, and get
Caught up
What we been through
Is enough to get intimate
Caught up
I'm feelin' you
And I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through
Just imagine what life be without me

But me and you
Had to meet, talk,
Fuck, and get
Caught up
What we been through
Is enough to get intimate
Caught up
I'm feelin' you
And I'm feeling we should both be free
If we were through
Just imagine what life be without me
