Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why's the power off and I'm fucked up
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs but regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma

You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on

But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out, it's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (Little prick just leave)
Ma let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats, 'specially when dad he fucked us both

We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close, nope
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load

Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry mama for "Cleanin' Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause

Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but

Now the medication's takin' over and your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both

Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em

And although one has only met their grandma
Once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this, overwhelming sadness come over me

As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my Mom and my Dad

So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing

So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar
'Cause you're my ma

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost

And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die

Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die

Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life
