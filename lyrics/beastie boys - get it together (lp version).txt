Chorus:
Intergalactic, planetery, planetery, intergalactic (x4)
Another dimension... (x8)

Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Like numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe its because we're so versatile
Style, profile I said
It always brings me back when I hear, "ooh child"
From The Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon to the very last mile
Well if you battle me I feel reviled
People always sayin' my style is wild
You've got gaul, you've got guile
If you step to me I'm going to rap full file
If you wanna battle you're in denial
Comin' from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead with my rhymes I'll trial
Cast you off into exhile

Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic (x2)

Jazz and AWOL, that's our team
Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
Well I have to keep it going keep it going full steam
To sweet to be sour to nice to be mean
With the tough guy style I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I'm going to plot and scheme
Mario C likes to keep it clean
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rappin', cause that's my dream
Thank Moe Dee for 'Sticking to Themes'
Now when it comes to envy ya'll is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the ryhme routine
Another dimension, new galaxy
Intergalatic planetary!

Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic (x4)

We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
Your rhymes are spread just like a pox
Cause the music is loud like an electric shock
I am known to do the wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D gets biz on the crops
Beastie Boys known to let the beat...
"MMM, D-r-r-rop!"
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If I rap soup my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack DJ AD Rock!
If you try to knock me you'll get mopped
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees start shakin and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock
