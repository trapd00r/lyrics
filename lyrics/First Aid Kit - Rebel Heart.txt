You told me once I have a rebel heart
I don't know if that's true
But I believe you saw something in me that lives inside you too
Now all I hear is the wind
There's a storm coming through
Did I misplace or forsake my love
Now that I gave it to you?

I don't know what it is that makes me run
That makes me wanna shatter everything that I've done
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?

Tell me why do I keep trying
To be someone I'll never be
I keep seeing her in everyone
Everyone but me
But I know you truly saw me
Even if just for a while
Maybe that's why it hurts now
To leave it all behind

I don't know what it is that makes me run
That makes me wanna shatter everything that I've done
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Why do I keep dreaming of you?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?
Is it all because of my rebel heart?

Nothing matters, all is futile
And it's fading fast
I fell so hard, so blindly
Had to come back and find me
I wanted you so much, so freely
Now I have to take it back
Nothing matters, all is futile
And it's in the past
