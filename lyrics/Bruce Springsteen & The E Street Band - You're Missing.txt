Shirts in the closet, shoes in the hall
Mama's in the kitchen, baby and all
Everything is everything, everything is everything
But you're missing

Coffee cups on the counter, jackets on the chair
Papers on the doorstep, but you're not there
Everything is everything, everything is everything
But you're missing

Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den
Your house is waiting, your house is waiting
For you to walk in, for you to walk in
But you're missing, you're missing
You're missing

When I shut out the lights, you're missing
When I close my eyes, you're missing
When I see the sun rise, you're missing

Children are asking if it's alright
Will you be in our arms tonight?

Morning is morning, the evening falls I have
Too much room in my bed, too many phone calls
How's everything, everything?
Everything, everything
You're missing
You're missing

God's drifting in heaven, devil's in the mailbox
I got dust on my shoes, nothing but teardrops
