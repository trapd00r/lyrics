Ha, ha it must be the ass

If they get any fatter
Man the rule
Gonna hafta get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile
In the freakiest landers
J to the L-O
Hello, no I'm not be
Harmin' y'alls wall
I'm the rule in the shot call
Off the wall
Like MJ in his early days
It's the achin' Lopez now

(Jennifer Lopez:)
Ain't it funny
It's been awhile since
You came around
Now ya wanna see
What's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me
Why ya want my time
Tryin' to tell me
How I'm on your mind
See it never had
To be this way
You should've never played
The games you played
Now I'm seein' that
You're kinda lame
Knowin how
The situation change

Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

I remember
How you walked away
Even when I tried
To call your name
See at first
I didn't understand
Now you're lookin'
Like a lonely man
I remember how you
Did me wrong
And now you're hurtin'
'Cause my love is gone
Everybody gets
A chance to burn
You can take it
As a lesson learned

Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

C-A double D, Hi
Double dose my
Fly by, red line
Touch the roast side
Oh I, never been
A sucker for chill Ja
Spit the ism, hit em
Get rid of em, and
You know Tah
Get it gully, and
Ain't that funny
How they want me
See me workin' wit money
But Cali ain't a dummy
What these brodies
Want from me?
'Cause all I got is G, J.Lo
And Murda I.N.C.

(Jennifer Lopez:)
I really wish
You wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me
Sit and reminisce
Tryin' to blind me
With your blingin' bling
Thought I told you
Love don't cost a thing
Hope you realise
That now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna
Hear from you
I had enough of
Bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin'
Why you play the fool?

Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
