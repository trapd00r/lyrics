I know you gon’ think you’re crazy
Just a foolish girl
But I believe just maybe
A heart a heart can save the world

[CHORUS:]
A heart a heart heart can save the world
I believe a [x2]

Imagine if
A heart, a heart, a heart can save the world

[VERSE 1:]
Disturbing London send the whole world our love
Where did time go how’d we use the hours up
I’m feeling like I can make the stars light up
I’m feeling like I can make the stars light up
Before I became a star I was wishing I was
They used to love me doing well and now it’s pissing them off
Hope it hurts below the belt like a kick in the crotch
Family of refugees is why were killing them soft
Yeah time to thicken the plot
I know they’re wishing they could bottle just a bit of my luck
’cause every time I touch the mic it’s like I’m singing for God
I give it everything I have I fucking give it a lot
Kofi tell the UN we need an immigrant mob
Full of blacks, full of Irish, full of women and dogs
We need a million man march, only a million can stop
Who’s gonna come and save the world make sure the villains are got?

Tell Mr Cameron and Oprah
Whe people unemployed and they dunno who to vote for?
We need a voice bigger than Mariah or Leona
A hero a soldier I think we need a donor you know
A Heart, a heart, a heart can save the world
Yeah you know
A Heart, a heart, a heart can save the world

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 2:]
Disturbing every city on the Map this year
Know that they can feel it in the atmosphere
Lived is just the devil spelt backwards yeah
Yeah and I’d rather fast forward than to be in rewind
So when you puff puff pass can you keep it alight
Heard a heart can save the world do you believe in the hype
If you could open up the heavens who’d you see in the sky
Lord gimmie a sign, open my eyes ’cause I see the blind leading the blind
Kids are having kids who don’t know how to read or to write
Its ’cause my father was a man he chose to be in my life
Had to see an optician helping me with my sight
Said don’t ever loose the hunger I can see in your eyes
I told her give me mouth to mouth because I need to survive
Can you perform the CPR that’s gonna keep us alive

I know you gon’ think you’re crazy
Just a foolish girl
But I believe just maybe
A heart a heart can save the world

[CHORUS:]
A heart, a heart, a heart can save the world
I believe a [x2]

Imagine if
A heart a heart a heart can save the world
