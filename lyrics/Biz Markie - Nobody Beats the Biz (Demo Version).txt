Biz, Biz Markie (Mr. Dynamite)
So fresh

Yes, y'all and, to the like beat and
You could either dance or just have a seat and
Listen to the way and, what I am displayin'
A different kind of rapper language that I am sayin'
To all the party people that absorbs the info
When it come to rockin' parties, I-am-a-nympho
Maniac, brainiac for doin' my dance
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Hypnotize your body and, like you do Bacardi and
You won't be fightin' or illin', you just be partyin'
Down with the funky sound with yours truly
I'm the original B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I above the-E
And I came to have fun and not be number one and
Just here to let you know who's like runnin' the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know that

Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)

You know me as the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E and
I go for what I know doin' a show for human beings
I'm guaranteed to rock, I make the ladies scream and shout
I'm bound to wreck your body as they turn the party out
The Mardi rapper, toe-tapper always have it flowin'
And when you hear the Biz Markie, I get the job done
Yes I'm the M-A-R, the K-I-E, you know that's me
I got the stutter step to keep in check, my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny, but I don't be carin'
I rock the Latin Quarter, Rooftop, Union Square and
Roseland, the Heartthrob, Madison Square Garden
Even rock for the World's Fair at Jaffer Center
Pardon the way that I be talkin' about the places I be rockin'
I love to perform for the people that be clockin'
Not sayin' that you're all mine, don't own it like I wanted
But you pay for the performance, doggone it, you want it
That's why I'm here, to be like lettin' you knowin'
That I'ma highly recognized as the king of disco and
Makin' people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment
I'm the best person for this type of employment
That's why

Biz, Biz Markie (the star of the show)
Beep, beep, so fresh
B, Biz Markie (hardworking)

So fresh

On and on to the break of dawn
When you buy food cheap, you need a coupon
Or catch a sale retail before it gets stale
So hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail
And shop nonstop, but how I hip-hop
On the mic and like
Make you cooperate with the rhythm, that is what I give 'em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
If I sound confusing, the style that I'm using
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous
Don't try to front, come on and admit you was
Thrilled, chilled, your heart was all filled
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap

Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)
Nobody beats the Biz (nobody beats the Biz)

Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz
My name is TJ Swan, nobody beats the Biz
I rock you on and on, nobody beats the Biz
You know nobody that beats the Biz
I know nobody that beats the Biz (so fresh)
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz

Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz
My name is TJ Swan, nobody beats the Biz
I rock you on and on, nobody beats the Biz
You know nobody that beats the Biz
I know nobody that beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz
