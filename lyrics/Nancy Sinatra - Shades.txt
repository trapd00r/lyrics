These shades can hide the teardrops crying.
But not the way I feel inside.
These shades can only do their part oh yeah.
But these shades can't hide the broken heart.

These shades can hide my red red eyes.
But not the hurt you left by your lies.
These shades can only do their part oh yeah.
But these shades can't hide the broken heart.
Dark shades I keep on wearin'
as long as I'm still cryin'


for you and I still love you so
oh why did you go now.

These shades can hide my eyes wawy.
But not the pain I feel each day.
These shades can only do their part oh yeah.
But these shades can't hide the broken heart.
But these shades can't hide the broken heart.....(fading)
