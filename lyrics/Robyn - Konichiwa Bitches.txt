Uh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

You wanna rumble in my jungle, I'll take you on (uh-huh)
Stampede your rumpa and send you home
You wanna rumble in space, I put my laser on stun
And on the north pole I'll ice you, son
You want a thrilla in Manila, you'll be killer bee stung
Want a taste of vanilla, better watch your tongue

'Cause I'll hammer your toe like a pediatrician (trician)
Saw you in half like I'm a magician (magician)
Tear you down like I'm in demolition
Count you out like a mathematician
I'm so very hot that when I rob your mansion
You ain't call the cops, you call the fire station

Cause my flavor's so sweet, you'll be zoom, zoom, zoom
Don't even get me started on my bada-boom-booms (boom)
One left, one right, that's how I organize 'em
You know I fill my cups, no need to supersize 'em
Right now you probably thinking, how she get in them jeans
Well, I'm gifted, all natural, I'm bursting the seams

(Uh-huh) Konichiwa, bitches
(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Konichiwa, bitches

Don't I look tasty like a French bon-bon
Even more sweeter than a cherry bomb
Coming with the postman like I'm a mail bomb
Coming in your mouth, make you say yum-yum

Hit the gong-gong, bring the sumos on
I'mma kick ass all the way to Hong Kong
Make the balls bounce like a game of ping pong
Konichiwa, bitches, from Beijing to Saigon

Got nothing on me cause you know you's so bum
Dum-didi-dum-didididi-dum-dum
Check the scenario, I'mma bust your ear drum
And leave you heads ringing with a ring-a-ding-dong

Busy on the mic since the day I was what? (born)
Check out my style, it's the Rock of what? (Mon')
Shine is on me like a dog on a what? (bone)
Fight the power, put myself on the throne

You know when shit is getting heavy like it weighs a ton (uh-huh)
I will run you down like a marathon (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Tape you up good, put you in the trunk
See you next Tuesday, you is a punk
