50 cent:
I think I'm a gangsta but I'm really not,
All I ever do is pick my nose and eat my snot,
I like to go around with tatoos and say I got shot,
When the holes are tattoos that were glued on the spot

I am not a gangsta
You just a wangsta bitch

I try to create an image that is fake
Like goin' to the library and eatin cake
I don't like that shit man, it's just not me
'Cause what I really like to do is drink my own pee

Nigger, I am
I stupid fat lipped motherfuckin ugly ass bitch ass nigger
Uh oh, here comes the KKK, I BETTER RUN!
