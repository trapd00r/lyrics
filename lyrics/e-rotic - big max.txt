Oh-oh-oh, you, big Max, please me
Oh-oh-oh, so, baby, squeeze me
Oh-oh-oh, it's big sex, tease me
Oh-oh-oh, I need it all night long
Just making love to you
Oh-oh-oh, big Max
Come on, all night long
Having sex just can't be wrong
Come on, up and down
When you touch the pleasure's bound
Hold me, hold me tight
We will make it through the night
Love is all you need
Watch up, baby, feel the heat!
Oh-oh-oh, you, big Max, please me
Oh-oh-oh, so, baby, squeeze me
Oh-oh-oh, it's big sex, tease me
Oh-oh-oh, I need it all night long
Make it, don't just fake it
So don't relax, big Max
Oh, baby, make it, I will take it
I really love to get your big sex
Oh-oh-oh, big Max
Oh-oh-oh, it's good to feel your sex
Come on, move your hips
Let's do it lips to lips
Come on, it's okay
You will like my special way
You will get it all
You will hear the angel's call
If it's good for you,
So it's good for big Max too!
