you've been a friend of mine 
one I depend upon for good advice
we're everyday people
and everyday we find a struggle in our lives
If things were easy, who'd need your sympathy
your doting arms or your tender words?
Well, Mattachine, I know you'll always be there for me 
when this tantrum dies
and you'll always be the one I need when I need advice
who put everything back in place when the world's gone awry
You're my Mattachine
Sure is a rocky road when you're the sorry thing who's fit to be tied
and life deals you a blow and all you want to do is sleep
and say "good night"
stare at the TV
sleep is uneasy
don't want your sympathy
your doting arms
or your tender words
