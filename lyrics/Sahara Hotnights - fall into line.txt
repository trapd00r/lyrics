Give me a moment, some peace of mind
Something to cheer me up
A brand new start 'cause I don't wanna
Hang on to what I've got

And things are just what they used to be
Boy, you have come too close
There's nothing here that you haven't seen
You're hidden, I'm exposed

Fall into line again
I'll never be a part of the deal
Won't fall into line again
Don't ever tell me how to feel

I've spent the last days telling lies
I've spread them nation wide
You hang around just to help me out
Show me another side

Fall into line again
I'll never be a part of the deal x2
Won't fall into line again
Don't ever tell me how to feel

You think I'm fine but I'm faking it
Hey, why don't you turn me in?
Gotta give me credit for breaking out
Of the state I'm in
