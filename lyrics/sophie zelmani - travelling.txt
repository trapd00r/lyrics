Baby, don't you worry so
This ain't the time to suffer
And baby, I'm in a hurry to...
We're just in a hurry
To be happy

We are doing fine
Since when did we let anything
Change it
And when you're lonely
With the time
You'll get something
And you might deserve it

You ain't travelling in the summer
Like you travel in the night
Your meeting with the morning
Is not like leaving the sunset light
You ain't travelling in the summer
Like you travel in the night
Your meeting with the morning
Is not like leaving the sunset light

Baby, there's nothing wrong
You'll find out who's the feeling
Confuses to be whole
But not strong
About those things
You'll be dreaming

You ain't travelling in the summer
Like you travel in the night
Your meeting with the morning
Is not like leaving the sunset light
You ain't travelling in the summer
Like you travel in the night
Your meeting with the morning
Is not like leaving the sunset light

Travelling...
Travelling...
