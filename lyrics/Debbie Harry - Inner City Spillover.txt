Lying in her bed a brick fell on her head.
Plaster finally crumbled and dropped its load.
Oh oh.
Now the building was condemned.
Recycled, used again.
The brick that smashed her brain is now a road in Maine.
When the pressure is way way down, the water comes out brown.
It was on television they took her brain uptown.
Fearing (peace?) would poison her, some abstract modern saint.
A painting or a sculpture or a cultural restraint.

Inner city spillover.
Where the big time ticks.
Royal rose's ovens, have to warm, what the furnace skips.
Inner city spillover.
Pop the scene.
Inner city spillover.
Isle of dreams.
Inner city spillover.
Workmen on the beam.

Lying on her bed a brick fell on her head.
You find the ace of hearts and win.
It's easy man!
At a higher school of knowledge, they put her brain in college.
Replacement parts and slippery cards will come around again.

The writings on the wall.

Statesmen say it all.
With the art wars on and the colors crash long long before the fall.
One out of these three cards will definitely up the odds.
Find the red heart, red to win.
Drop on in.
Time out and time in all the suckers play it again by the broadway babies and the island men and the hotshots gamblin'.
Inner city spillover.
Pops and picks.
Inner city spillover.
Where the big time ticks.
Inner city spillover.
Isle of dreams.
Inner city spillover.
Workmen on the beam.
Inner city spillover.
Subway riders fight.
Newsmen uncover more horrors to describe.
Okay sweetheart, pull over, where'd you learn to drive? .
Angels eye the people over, ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai!.

Inner city spillover.
Where the big time ticks.
Royal rose's ovens, have to warm, what the furnace skips.
Inner city spillover.
Pop the scene.
Inner city spillover.
Workmen on the beam.
