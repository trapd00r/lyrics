Can I count you as my friend,
the way your loyalty can bend.
One day it's light and then it's black,
that heavy pressure on my back.

I don't know how to read the sign,
Lord I must be blind,
But, that's my blood on the line.
That's my blood on the line.
That's my blood on the line.

I don't know how to shut my mouth,
no other way to let it out.
I have a voice that won't be heard,
an empty cage without a bird.

I don't know how I missed the sign,
Lord I must be blind,
But, that's my blood on the line. 
That's my blood on the line.

(BRIDGE) 
Oh, I'm holdin' on to something,
more than words and magazines.
I know I can't lose sight of the one thing
that keeps you lovin' me.
A way to getting my dream.

I don't know how to make amends.
I don't know how this story ends.
And all the words that you don't hear.
Will rise and deafen in your ears.

I don't understand the sign,
But, Lord I know I'm not blind,
And that's my blood on the line.
That's my blood on the line.
That's my blood on the line.
That's my blood on the line.
