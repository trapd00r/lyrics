While he was scheming 
I was beamin' in the beamer just beamin'
can't believe that I caught my man cheating
so I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia 
And as the cash box rang I
thought everything away

(0ops)
there goes the dreams we used to say

(oops)
there goes the time we spent away

(oops)
there goes the love I had 
but you cheated on me and that's SCORED THAT now

(oops)
there goes the house we made a home

(oops)
there goes you'll never leave me alone

(oops)
for all lies you told this is what you owe

{Chorus}

Hey Ladies,
when your man wants to get buck wild
just go back and hit 'em up style
put your hands on his cash and 
spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
oh
when your cold and everything goes
from the crib, to the ride and the clothes
so you better let him know that 
if he mess up
you gotta hit 'em up


While he was braggin
I was comin' down the hill uh just-a draggin'
all of his pictures and his clothes in the baggin 
I sold eveything else til there was just nothing left
and I paid all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
the love we had just faded away, away

(oops and chorus)

All of the dreams you sold
left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other
And all of the things I sold 
Will take you until you get old 
To get 'em back without me
Cause revenge is better than money you'll see

{chorus}
