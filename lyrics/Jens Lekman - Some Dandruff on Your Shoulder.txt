It's a young Friday night
And I'm filled up to the brim
With an old, old feeling
That can't be turned into art
Except maybe a letter
Of resignation
If you'd frame it
And left it burning on your wall
She asks you what's wrong
You say nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing at all
It's just the pressure with which you hold her
It's really nothing at all
It's just some dandruff on your shoulder
It's just that every moment
Casts a shadow
A sadness of it's not being something else
Other than itself
She asks you what's wrong
You say nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
