Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh talk to me, can't you see
I'll help you work things out
Oh don't wannabe your enemy
And I don't wanna scream and shout

Cos baby I believe in honesty
A man that's stong and true
That I believe in you
I shouldn't have to say now baby

What took you so long
What took you all night
You know I treat you so good
I make you feel fine
What took you forever to see I'm right

And no I'll never give it up this time
No, no, no
Oh you touched my heart, right from the start
You didn't know what to say
But honey understand, when you take my hand
Everything's okay

Cos baby I believe reality
It's never far away
I've had enough, so listen baby
I've got something to say

What took you so long
What took you all night
What took you forever to see I'm right
You know I treat you so good
I make you feel fine

You know I'll never give it up this time
What took you so long (what took you so long)
What took you all night (what took you all night)
What took you forever to see I'm right
You know I treat you so good (I treat you so good)
I make you feel fine (I make you feel fine)
You know I'll never give it up this time
No, no, no

(No, no, no)
No, no, no (no, no, no)
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

A man that's stong and true
Baby I believe in honesty
I shouldn't have to say now baby

That I believe in you
What took you so long
What took you all night
What took you forever to see I'm right
I make you feel fine

You know I treat you so good
You know I'll never give it up this time
What took you so long (what took you so long)
What took you all night (what took you all night)
What took you forever to see I'm right
I make you feel fine (I make you feel fine)
You know I'll never give it up this time
You know I treat you so good (I treat you so good)
