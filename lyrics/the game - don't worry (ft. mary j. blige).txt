(Mary)
Can't wait til we make real love
Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really lookin forward to a future for us,
Baby don't worry bout it, ima be right here, waitin on you

Even took a second job
So they won't take the cars and put a lean on the house
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out
Baby don't worry about it, ima be right here, waitin on you

And them dudes you ran wit are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry bout it, ima be right here, waitin on you

(Game)
All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slip on them D&R dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith & Wesson
Cuz them niggaz in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta lovin and that lil affection
And butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nothin above you,
And behind that vest I gotta heart ma, gangstas need love too

(Mary)
Some think the worst of you
They betray you as a man it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it, ima be right here, waiting on you

(Game)
It use to be caramel skin tones, spreewell rims on
Glasshouse, ass out, Jacob watch, gems stones
Bandana, Nike airs, tennis bracelet, wife here
Black rag, do or die 45 right here
Everytime i was down you was always right here
Whenever visitin hours came, i know my wife there
So pink diamonds right there, Chain hang ice there
The reason for my tatooed tear
I need you to hold me down

(Mary)
I'll be waiting on you (I)
I'll be waitin on you (ima be right here whenever you call me)
I'll be waiting on you (ooh)
Baby don't worry bout it, ima be right here, waitin on you

(Game)
I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cuz the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here ion know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bussin that tre pound
I would neva ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach, in Sandro Pe sound
And no more out of town trips on the greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre out

(Mary)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (ima be right here for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
Baby don't worry about it (don't worry baby) ima be right here, waitin for you

I'll be waiting on you (ima be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I'll)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me)
Baby don't worry about it, ima be right here, waitin on you

I'm lookin for a future with u baby,
I wanna see you real soon, real soon real soon,
I'll be right there, I'll be right there

Baby don't worry about it (don't worry) ima be (don't worry) right here (don't worry) waiting on you (ooh)
