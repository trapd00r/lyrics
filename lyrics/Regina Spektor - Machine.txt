My eyes are bi-focal
My hands are sub-jointed
I live in the future
In my pre-war apartment

And I count all my blessings
I have friends in high places
And I'm upgraded daily
All my wires without traces

Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
I'm hooked into
Hooked into

Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
I'm hooked into
Hooked into machine

I collect my moments
Into a correspondence
With a mightier power
Who just lacks my perspectives
And who lacks my organics
And who covets my defects
And I'm downloaded daily
I am part of a composite

Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
I'm hooked into
Hooked into

Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
Hooked into machine
I'm hooked into
Hooked into machine

Everything's provided
Consummate consumer
Part of worldly taking
Apart from worldly troubles

Living in your pre-war apartment
Soon to be your post-war apartment
And you live in the future
And the future
It's here
It's bright
It's now
