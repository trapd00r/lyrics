Raise your hand, wave goodbye
Say your words, give your lines

Easy come and easy go, to and fro
Tell me where to go

I'm taking time to discover
The bonds you're breaking
Won't just keep the two of us apart

Won't take it for I love the others
There's no forsaking
The place and the people in my heart

Light the match, burn me down
Bite the hand, bite the sound

We're still pulling and pushing trains from the rail
What's all that 'bout breaking bread going stale?
You hum another names

I'm taking time to discover
The bonds you're breaking
Won't just keep the two of us apart

Won't take it for I love the others
There's no forsaking
The place and the people in my heart

(What I said)
Now that you know me very well, go to hell
Go to hell, my belle

I'm taking time to discover
The bonds you're breaking
Won't just keep the two of us apart

Won't take it for I love the others
There's no forsaking
The place and the people in my heart
The place and the people in my heart
The place and the people in my heart

I'm taking time to discover
The bonds you're breaking
Won't just keep the two
Won't just keep the two of us apart
The place and the people in my heart

The bonds you're breaking
Won't just keep the two of us apart
Won't take it for I love the others
There's no forsaking
The place and the people in my heart

The place and the people in my heart
The place and the people in my heart
