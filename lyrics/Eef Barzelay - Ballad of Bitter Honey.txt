That was my ass you saw bouncing
Next to Ludacris
It was only on screen for a second
But it was kinda hard to miss
And all those other hoochie skanks
They ain't got shit on me
And one of Nelly's bodyguards
He totally agreed

My mother cleaned the homes of wealthy peopletill the day
She died and so to California
I did make my way
I tried to finish nursing school
I really wanted to, you see
But all those broken bodies
Well they, they really got to me

And they all think I'm stupid
I can see it in their eyes
But I know what's inside their hearts
I penetrate their lives
Sometimes it gets me crazy
But I keep my feelings hid
'Cause I know deep inside they're only frightened little kids

And if I press my breasts together
And arch my back just so
I can ask for pretty things
And they will not say no
No one should have to suffer
No one should go without
Don't hate me 'cause I know just what this world is all about
Don't hate me 'cause I know just what this world is all about
