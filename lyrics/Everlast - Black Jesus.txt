They call me white devil, black Jesus
Heaven closes, hell freezes
Ego's trippin', scripts keep flippin'
Bloods keep bloodin', Crips keep crippin'

Time keeps slippin', and I keep fallin'
I can't see but I hear them callin' 
Ballers ballin', Players playin', 
Haters fightin', righteous prayin'

Dawn breakin', Manhattan keeps makin'
Brooklyn keeps takin', shook ones keep shakin'
No time for fakin', nah mean I ain't choppin' no pies
Just risin' like cream

If you're digging the scene
If you feelin' the vibes
Throw your hands in the air
Scream out you're alive

Singin' na na nana na na...

They call me black Jesus, white Moses
Heaven freezes, hell closes
B.Boy poses, and punk rock chicks
The kids are all right but I need my fix

If you're diggin' the mix, you're feelin' the drugs
If you're keepin' it real, if you're livin' like thugs
I spit kisses and hugs like 45 slugs
Come back on the one and kiss my love gun

Gotta look that will kill, a voice that will carry
Half a dozen women that I think I wanna marry
The trouble on my mind I'm refusin' to lose
Still I've gotta find someone to abuse

So won't you run spread the news
Help say the word 
And jump the fuck back
And just act like you heard

They call me white devil, black Jesus 
Heaven closes, Hell freezes
Black Jesus, white Moses
Heaven freezes, Hell closes

Singin' na na nana na na...

They call me white sinner, black martyr
Live wire, fire starter
Jungle brother, red neck cracker
Freak of nature, new world slacker

Sex junkie lookin' for a dealer
You can play the leaper girl and I can play the healer
Shit is only getting realer baby haven't you heard 
That the Bird, bird, bird, yes the bird is the word

They go one for the trouble
Two for the time, three for my homies
And four for the dimes
Singin' lemons to the lime till the break of dawn

Excuse me every six minutes, Everlast you're on
And they go on and on
Like a rolling stone, baby 
Anywhere I lay my hat is my home

They call me white devil, black Jesus
Heaven closes, Hell freezes
Black Jesus, White Moses
Heaven freezes, Hell closes

Singin' na na nana na na...
