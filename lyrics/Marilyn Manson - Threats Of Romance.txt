A girl is a man's sweetness
We all know the way it ends
No matter how many times we film it
The audience thinks they've seen it for the first time

Things that pretty are always kept behind glass
Someone like me, someone like me can't make it last
I like you damaged, but I need something left
Something for me, something for me to wreck

You are my sickness
We all know the way it ends
No matter how we film it, the audience thinks
That they saw it for the first time

Things that pretty are always kept behind glass
Someone like me, someone like me can't make it last
I like you damaged, but I need something left
Something for me, something for me to wreck

I like you damaged, but I need something left
Something for me, something for me to wreck
Something for me to wreck
Something for me to wreck

My seed would have make new fruit
And you could have been a tree
Or I could have cut you down
Or just let you be

These things that pretty are always kept behind glass
Someone like me, someone like me can't make it last

I like you damaged, I like damaged
I like you damaged, I like damaged
I like you damaged, I like damaged
Damaged, I like you damaged
