A dying flame, youre free again
Who could love and do that to you
All dressed in black, he won't be coming back
Save your tears, you've got years and years
The pains of seventeens
Unreal, they're only dreams
Save your crying for the day

Fool if you think it's over
Because you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over - I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look of the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun
Miss teenage dream, sucg a tragic scene
He's knocked your crown and ran away
First wound of pride and how
you've cried and cried
But save your tears you've years and years
Fool if you think it's over

I'll buy your first good wine
We'll have a real good time
And save your crying for the day
That may not come but anyone

Fool if you think it's over....
