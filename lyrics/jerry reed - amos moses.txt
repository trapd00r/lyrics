Yeah, here comes Amos

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by himself in the swamp
He hunted alligators for a livin
He just knock em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get ya Amos
It ain't legal hunting alligators down in the swamp, boy

Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist, and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana bayou

About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cause the alligator bit it
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow

Well the sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp trappin' alligator skins
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well, I wonder where the Louisiana sheriff went to
Well you can sure get lost in a Louisiana bayou

About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses
