(verse 1)
chea chea
dear god let me clense my soul/ throw away all the rims and the gold/
o no I cant do that/ do I love god? True dat/ but I got a gun so move back/
im loco like 5 eses in the side of chevelle ridin on low pros/
im a renegade ride with the 44/ been a gangbanger all my life, f**k the popo/
I aint never been a cocky kid/ know they could kill me if they shot pac and big/
but I let my bandana hang/ in the city of angles we gangbang/
I move that chronic and yayo/ way before I met 50, banks, buck and yayo/
ask eminem, even dr. dre know/ I put one in last ten in the range rov/
used to push that rock like jay hov/ you better lay low when the ak blow/
or get wings and a halo/ run to the hood and tell em im the nigga they gotta pray for/
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah/
I said run to the hood and tell em im the nigga they gotta pray for, lay low and stay low

chea chea
im a gangbanger don't get it f**ked up/ you aint never bang, you aint never laces chucks up/
so how the f**k you gon criticize me/ I aint the reason niggas is bangin the nyc/
makin bullshit threats on the m.i.c./ I don't wake up in cold sweats when I sleep/
I live comfortably/ with a red rag tied around the 45 in case nigga try to come for me/
mad cause I started my own company/ I don't know what the f**k niggas want from me/
except something for free/ before the documentary dropped, you bitch niggas wasn't bumpin me/
and to some degree/ I gotta keep that 4-5th under me/ I don't run from beef/
it's either cock back, squeeze, or be underneath/ cause im from the streets of (compton)


and my grandmother died before I was multi/ wasn't raised right cause my parents was both high/
high off cocaine, my introduction to the dope game came in 85 watchin soul train/
mama told me I was the future, and one day I'll be fly like soul plane/
just don't bang/ but back then, I'd do anything for a jerri-curl and a gold chain/
niggas always got something to say/ like they aint never bumped n.w.a./
punk niggas talk shit, but when they need hits they swallow their f**king pride and come runnin to dre/
niggas come to LA when they need to talk/ cause kanye told everybody jesus walks/
bush killed more niggas in the towers then gangbanging ever did, that's why they need new york/
