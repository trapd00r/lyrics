Yo! My name is Dr. Alban, the MD - Microphone Doctor. This song is dedicated to the people of Afrika
SweMix, gimme some drums!
Hello Afrika, tell me how you're doin'
Hello motherland, tell me how you're doin' (2X)

Hello Nigeria! That's my motherland
Coming to Sweden now causin' hysteria
Takes a long time to travel the globe
So why be shy? Why be humble?
I just came straight of the jungle
You can't compete with me
'Cause you know I got the rhythm
I did it before and I'll do it again
So listen watcha say, yeah hear my point of view
Not everyone can do this, no, in fact only a few
Sophisticated, hardcreated, that's who I am
And you know I've been waiting, so start pumping,
Make some noise
The Mandika tribe, the Hausa tribe, the Fulani tribe,
The Gooya tribe, The Zulu tribe,
Mi no live in a house, mi live in a tree
Electricity can give you a shock
Mi no smoke no cig, mi no take no coke
All mi take is a glass of juice

I have been mourning, I have been grieving
I have been crying, no more tears in my eyes
There's a hottie hottie wind blowing south to north
Following on my head, drying all my plants
If there's a mercy in the clouds,
Who know the right is never wrong?
Move the sadist off my back
And stop the fire burning in my home Afrika
Here comes the news from mighty Lord
Transqualation is about to come to Earth, right
Rapping is digging down river north to south
To let milk and honey flow side to side
My name is Alban, mi is a dentist,
Mi DJ here, mi DJ there
Mi have a shop on Slojdgatan, Alphabet St. is da name
Mi live in no house, mi live in a flat
Electricity can give you a shock
Mi smoke no cig, mi take no coke
All mi takes is a glass of juice

Mmm, jumping on the mic
'Cause me a rockin' up affection
When I'm holdin' me a mic
'Cause me awesome effectious
What you say to me, me a fun a me warm
Spend some me a time on the tresittia dime
Don't you try to follow me you ought to realize
What me are what me a really want
Me not fryin', no, I'm just coolin'
Come on now just set if off
