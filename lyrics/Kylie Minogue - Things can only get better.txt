Make up your mind and don't believe
It's bad news everywhere
Take your time and look around
Because there's something in the air
There's a feeling that's gaining ground

And everyone can have a share
Don't miss your chance 
Take up your stance
And just be sure that you are there

It's in your hands now
To change your fortune
To shape your future
Be proud of yourself
Remember, things can only get better

If you believe inside your heart
Nobody's second class
Every day's a brand new start
What's past is past

And if your dreams go nowhere
Don't give up the fight
Come with me and you will see
It all looks different in the morning light

It's in your hands now
To change your fortune
To shape your future
Be proud of yourself
Remember, things can only get better

If you're feeling you can't go on and you're
Lost and lonely and feel so afraid
Remember, things can only get better

It's in your hands now
To change your fortune
To shape your future
Be proud of yourself
Remember, things can only get better

If you're feeling you can't go on and you're
Lost and lonely and feel so afraid
Remember, things can only get better

It's in your hands now
To change your fortune
To shape your future
Be proud of yourself
Remember, things can only get better
