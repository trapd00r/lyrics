(Verse 1: Bizarre)
"This is a bad day.."
(Random lady:)
"Motherfucker you need to get up and find your ass a job,
I'm sick of you just layin around all day long playin' nintendo.
They don't even make nintendos no more!
Where the hell you find that shit at?
And I know that you can find a job, your bus pass is in your wallet I seen that shit yesterday, you just sit up all day long!
Lie lie lie
Eat eat eat
Drink drink drink
You don't do shit! I'm sick of you!"
(Bizarre:)
"Just wakin' up in the mornin gotta thank God, got my asscheeks stuck to a fishin rod, where's the dogs ain't no frogs, momma cookin breakfast with no (laws?)
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out, no Thanksgivin so we eatin, carry out.
This dude came through my front door, he said I wouldn't live to see 24
I gotta go 'cause I got on flip flops
If I sold out then my feet'd drop.
Had to stop, at the red light, everybody laughin' at my yellow dirtbike.
And everythings all right
I got a beatin' from Sherry, she's a transvesdite
Callin up my homies and I'm askin y'all
Bring twenty, bottles of alcohol
Playin' football, and I'm in trouble
They gave me the ball, I fumbled
And I can't believe, my best friends gay
Today was a bad day.

"Yeah... today was fucked up
Hey man you gotta sing fo these niggas
Today was a bad day
Today was fucked up!"

"I bust my ass in the shower
Got on this fresh new baby powder
Kids just today these dudes try to blast me
Saw the police, and got my ass beat
No flexin, wooped my ass, in the intersection, till I shoot that's the question
With the beats and, I was watchin rap city, shootin them craps, I got fifty
Shake 'em up (x3)
Shake em
A couple a niggas, watch me all break em
They beat my ass, I need nine, nine eleven
They threw my ass through this back door
They took all my cash flow
Punched me in the chest, and kicked me in the asshole
I just found out, my best friends gay
Today was a bad day."

"Yeah... today was all fucked up
Rainin an shit.
Today was a bad day
Rainin shit, yeah.
You seen that shit nigga
Today was fucked up!"

"Left my homies house paid, picked up this chick been tryin' rape since twelfth grade
Its ironic,
Decisions and demand
An art test fired on the fan (?)
Took a trip to Miami
Got my ass beat at the twenty first grammys
My dick is so weak, so weak, so weak I put my own ass to sleep
Woke up around one, didn't hesitate to say that she didn't cum
Ridin' down seven mile coast an, sippin on a potion, rubbin on some baby oil lotion
And nothin' seems, to work out
She smacked me in the face, and mirked out
Today was like one of those bad dreams, jackin off with a bowl full of whip cream
Helicopter lookin' for the murderer
Two in the mornin got the Cody allen (?) burger
Even with the lights of the good year blimp, and in red, bizarre ain't shit
Drunk as hell, and I'm throwin' up
Page your cat off, so you know it ain't blowin' up
I found that my best friend was gay
Today was a bad day.."

"You seen that shit nigga
Today was a bad day
Today was fucked up!
Hannicap Circus, commin soon
Bizarre, HannniCap Circus
Today was a bad day mother fucker
Fuck y'all."
