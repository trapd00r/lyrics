I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shining
Our 60 Cadillac was roaring through Nebraska whining
Doing 120 man the fields was bending over
Heading out for the mountains knowing we was traveling further
All the fires were blazing and the spinning wheels were turning turning
Had my girl beside me, brother, brother, she was burning burning

Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher
She had a line on something heavy but we couldn't reach her
We told her that we needed something that would get us going
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showing
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up
The cops came busting in and then we lit out in a pickup truck

Go! Get out of Denver, better, go
Get out of Denver, better, go,
Get out of Denver, better, go
Cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member
Get out of Denver
Get out of Denver

Well, red lights were flashing and the sirens were a-screaming screaming
We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreaming
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour
Lord, it started drizzling and it turned into a thundershower

The rain was driving but the Caddy kept on burning rubber
We kept on driving till we ran into some fog cover
We couldn't see a thing but somehow we just kept on going
We kept on driving all night long and then into the morning fog
It finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at
We're staring at a Colorado state policeman trooper cat

Go! Get out of Denver, better, go
Get out of Denver, better, go,
Get out of Denver, better, go
Cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member
Get out of Denver
Get out of Denver

Go! Get out of Denver, better, go
Get out of Denver, better, go,
Get out of Denver, better, go
Cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member
Get out of Denver
Better go!
