The first time I met the Devil was at a Motel 6
She left Hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About five-foot five, gettin' thick in the breast and thighs

Beautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands and long hair
I said "I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it.
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it."

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you, through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must hustle

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you, through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must hustle

Who cares what Jane says, she always spits the same spit
I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion
Somehow she'll discover it through the pop music

Got used to the feeling of falling
But you'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private Saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the gray matter

Little baby doll, she doesn't know what to say to y'all
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all, smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last

It hurts to watch Lucy lose a dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down, I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found
And I'll tell her that

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you, through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must hustle

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you, through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must hustle

Hush little lady, don't say a word
Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let 'em know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow

I'm a chapter in your textbook
Read me like a check book
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub

The modern man's hustle, I dig it, I shovel
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it get, I'll keep your winter afloat

So let the snow fall (it's coming down)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She look at the mirror she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be

Lay your head on my chest, speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position
And if you didn't know you better listen
{You better listen, 'cause)

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you, through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must hustle

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you, through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must hustle
