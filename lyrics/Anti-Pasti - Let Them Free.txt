Is anybody out there
Let them join the kids
But the soldier boy was breathing
When they nailed the coffin lids, lids

Claim to be a majority
No that's a lie
Barely a minority
Queuing up to die

Let them free lift the lids
Let them free your the kids

The army ban your marching
They've got a lot to learn
I'm supposed to answer
War is no concern of theirs
