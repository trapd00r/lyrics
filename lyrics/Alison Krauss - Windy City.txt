We came to big city, from our little country town
And every step he takes with you, is down
And you're as cold and heartless, as your chilling winds that blow
Before you freeze his heart, please let him go

Windy City; you're haunting my baby
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
Windy City; turn loose of my baby
If you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind

At night I walk your sidewalks, and look in every bar
I love him even though, he's gone too far
Your swinging doors stay open, just to keep him from my side
And I'm on your lonely streets, again tonight

Windy City; you're haunting my baby
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
Windy City; turn loose of my baby
And if you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind
If you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind ...
