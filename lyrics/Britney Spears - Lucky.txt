"This is a story about a girl named Lucky..."

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, a perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for, baby

Isn't she lovely
This Hollywood girl?

And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and
She keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?

Baby, now, isn't she lovely
This Hollywood girl?

And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

"Best actress, and the winner is... Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson from Pop News
Standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky!
Oh, my God, here she comes!"

Isn't she lovely
This Hollywood girl?...

"She is so lucky
But why does she cry?
If there is nothing
Missing in my life
Why do tears come at night?"

And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

She's so lucky
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
