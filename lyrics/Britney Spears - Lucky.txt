She wakes up 
Knock, knock, knock on the door 

It's time for makeup 
Perfect smile 
It's you they're all waiting for 

Isn't she lovely 
This Hollywood girl

She's so Lucky 
She's a star 
But she cry cry cries in her lonely heart 
Thinking, if there's nothing missing in my life 
Then why do these tears come at night?

But there's no one there to wake her up 
And the world is spinning and she keeps on winning 
But tell me, what happens when it stops
