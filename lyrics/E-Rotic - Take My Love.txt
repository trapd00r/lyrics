Take my love
Don't let my feelings die
Take my love
And never ask me why
Oehoe
It's now or never, baby blue
I'm giving all my love to you
Believe me now, believe forever
If you don't like we've stayed together
My heart is wide open
It's yours to feel
The night is hot, the night is real
And don't the winds of change will blow
hey, babe, I'll never let you go
Take my love
Don't let my feelings die
Take my love
And never ask me why, oehoeh
Fly me out of danger now
It's how it's meant to be
Angels guard and angels fly
Keep an eye on me
Take my love
Don't make my dream a lie
Take my love
And never say goodbye
Take my love
Don't let my feelings die
Take my love
And never ask me why
The fire's on, the fire grows
What's gonna happen heaven know
It's dark outside, but I will hold you
I'll be a sunshine as I told you
I take your love as night over
Oh, babe, don't wanna see you cry
What tomorrow brings you never know
But, babe, I'll never let you go
(chorus x2)
