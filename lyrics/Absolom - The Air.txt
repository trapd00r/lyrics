Every night I see the most horrible things 
Murder, rape, genocide, torture, catastrophes 
Terrible wars with weapons we can't even imagine today 
They will come with ships on the water 
And with unbelieveable speed through the air 
With fire and gaz and invisible vapours 
They will destroy everything - everything

Would you dance with me
Touch my body
Would you care for me
Just let me know
All I need is the air that I breathe
Is the air I breathe
Just let me know
All I need is the air that I breathe
Is the air I breathe

The air that I breathe

It's a tragedy
The end is near
Discover me
You have the key

All I need is the air that I breathe
Is the air I breathe
Just let me know
All I need is the air that I breathe
Is the air I breathe

The air that I breathe
The air that I breathe
The air that I breathe
