Move through the light, barely awake
Pink-blue lye on salty break, so long
Spaces in the dark feel far away
Called to mind a place where it used to rain

I see you in a nothing sky
Now the morning is mended
You, moving through
As a likeness to defend it
Morning is mended
Morning is mended

Song and sea came out of me
Left it on the steps and walked away, goodbye
Don't wait long, I'll be gone
Thoughts of you are etched upon my mind

I, I'm a nothing sky
Story's never-ending
You, moving through
As a likeness to defend it
Morning is mended
Morning is mended
