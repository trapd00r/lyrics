Judge not and shall be judged first 
Die nigga, die nigga 

chorus 
Look in my eyes, see what I see 
Do what I do, be what I be 
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet 
And know why I lurk the streets 

DMX: 
Burning in hell, but don't deserved to be 
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me 
It's because they heard of me 
And they know that the Dark is for real 
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill 
Be poppin, robbin and chill, take it over there bark wit' it 
From Ohio to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it 
Come through flyin', a 129 
Up the school street cuz I come through mine 
Barking my dogs, get at me nigga 
arf arf arf 
Get at me nigga 
What the deal is, never forget what real is 
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is 
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms 
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb 
Then come for the star 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm 
Feel me yo 

chorus 2x 

DMX: 
I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me 
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me 
Cuz I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow 
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go 
Feel me yo 
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark 
About to bark, take it to the heart cuz it's real like that 
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that 
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' getcha 
With the steal, what you don't know is gon' splitcha 
I can blaze tracks 
Make niggas play raps and raise stacks 
Paybacks a bitch, didn't you used to say that 
Play around in dirt, you get mugged 
Cuz you know, I can either spread love or shed blood 
And bloodshed turns to mudred and real sticky 
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky 
For real 

chorus 

DMX: 
I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role 
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole 
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight 
Just like first time soldier eighth done told us not to hate 
But then it's out of state, and it's too late 
For change is to be made 
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade 
This is it, that nigga's got to give me a place 
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me away 
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me 
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty 
It was always his versus me, but now I gotta teach him 
Personal feelings put aside, cuz now I gotta reach him 
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him 
But it seems like I've been called on to show him 
So I'ma show him 
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me 
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly 

chorus 2x 

Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy. For real. 
arf arf, arf, arf, arf
