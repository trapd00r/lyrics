V1
Night rain
Cold wind blowing against my skin
Night rain
Darkest beauty I’ve ever seen
You came just when I needed you to wash away the pain
Night rain

Chorus:
Night rain
Look how you washed it all away
Night rain
You’re a reminder, Night rain

V2
And whenever it pours again
I’ll remember what you did that day
Nothing thrilled me anymore, I had shut the door
To let fate take me away
But then you came
Reminding me that things can change
That they don’t have to stay the same
Just like the way of the rain

Chorus:
Night rain
Look how you washed it all away
Night rain
You’re a reminder, Night rain

You washed away…
You washed away…
