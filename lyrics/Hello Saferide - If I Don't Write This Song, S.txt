The way we're living makes no sense
Take me back to the age of innocence
I want to go back then
Take me back to the age of innocence
Back to the age of innocence

When flaws were fixed by laws and books
When singers wrote songs instead of hooks
When the value wasn't in the price
When the fight for life was in the civil right
When you couldn't live life through a screen
When everything you knew was as good as it seems
When the only worry was the concept of sin
When did it begin?

I wonder if I could go back to old Hollywood
When presidents dropped blond bombshells
instead of creating the perfect hell.
The way we're living makes no sense
Take me back to the age of innocence (hey)
I wanna go back then
Take me back to the age of innocence
Back to the age of innocence

When pharmaceuticals weren't there to make life beautiful
When the way that we were born was more than suitable
When everybody thought that they could make a difference
And you couldn't get your fix within an instant

I wonder if I could go back to old Hollywood
When presidents dropped blond bombshells
instead of creating the perfect hell.
The way we're living makes no sense
Take me back to the age of innocence (hey)
I wanna go back then
Take me back to the age of innocence
Back to the age of innocence

(Jeff hit emâ€™ with that solo!)

I wanna get older
Don't wanna fight my age
Now take me back to the simpler days
I wonder how it all happened
I wanna get older
Don't wanna fight my age
Don't wanna be the prey to the scalpels blade
Now please tell me, please tell me,
What ever happened?
(ha-ha-ha-happened)

I wonder if I could go back to old Hollywood
When presidents dropped blond bombshells
instead of creating their lies to tell.
The way we're living makes no sense
Take me back, take me back to the age of innocence
I wanna go back then
Take me back, take me back to the age of innocence
Back to the age of innocence

I wanna get older
Don't wanna fight my age
Now take me back to the simpler days
I wonder how it all happened
I wanna get older
Don't wanna fight my age
Don't wanna be the prey to the scalpels blade
Now please tell me, please tell me,
What ever happened?
