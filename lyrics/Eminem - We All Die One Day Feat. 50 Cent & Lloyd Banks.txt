(Tony Yayo: "Yeah!
U rockin' with the Talk of New York Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins
Here we go!")

(Chorus: Lloyd Banks)
Niggas Know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

(Tony Yayo: "Obie Trice")
(Obie Trice)
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes
Everybody runnin' for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
O's an animals skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in God it 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
Keep this a secret right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

(Tony Yayo: "Lloyd Banks")
(Lloyd Banks)
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet on words
Touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case then get a bigga one
You don't think I pack the pump 'cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains
I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, 'cause I don't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft

(Tony Yayo: "Yo Em spin that shit")
(Eminem)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gonna get it
Name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM)
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin' P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fuckin' with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spittin' baby food on people
At San Pedro ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cat peeled back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in you're like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dog
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco S.A.?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm slim sha-"D" and the "d" is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for Easter please come

(Tony Yayo: Here We Go)
(50 Cent)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gonna get it
Name em, we gon hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossburg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear god 'cause I bring death
Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fin to touch something
When I raise my knife shit I'm fin to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me

(Haha Sorry Kim haha... Oh sorry haha)
