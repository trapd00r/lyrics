Not quite of my standing
A side where you can see
Here flowers left to dry
A fair ceremony
Cooped up lockless energy
All a mental jewel
I can’t see us standing there
But can you see me too

Highway Car
Highway Car

Playing poetry with reckless
A secondary tome
The stranger in memorial
Has crossed his path with you
Eyes way past my woman’s glass
It’s all melted white
All the sunsets in the west
Will slowly take us back
