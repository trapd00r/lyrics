If you ever get close to a human
And human behaviour
Be ready, be ready to get confused
And me and my here after

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
To human behaviour
But yet so, yet so irresistible
And me and my fear can
And there's no map
and a compass
wouldn't help at all

They're terribly moody
And human behaviour
Then all of a sudden turn happy
And they and my here after
But, oh, to get involved in the exchange
Of human emotions
Is ever so, ever so satisfying

Oh oh, and there's no map and chair too

Human behaviour, human
Human, human behaviour, human
Human, human behaviour, human
Human behaviour, human

And there's no map
And a compass
Wouldn't help at all

Human behaviour, human, human
Human behaviour, human,
Human behaviour, human,
Human behaviour

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

Human, human
Human behaviour
Human

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic

Human, human, human, human.
