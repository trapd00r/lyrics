This is me for forever, one of the lost ones
The one without a name, without an honest heart as compass
This is me for forever, one without a name
These lines the last endeavor to find the missing lifeline

Oh, how I wish for soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart, lost in the dark
For hope, I'd give my everything

My flower withered between the pages two and three
The once and forever bloom gone with my sins
Walk the dark path, sleep with angels, call the past for help
Touch me with your love, and reveal to me my true name

Oh, how I wish for soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart, lost in the dark
For hope, I'd give my everything
Oh, how I wish for soothing rain
Oh, how I wish to dream again
Once and for all, and all for once
Nemo my name forevermore

Nemo, sailing home
Nemo, letting go

Oh, how I wish for soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart, lost in the dark
For hope, I'd give my everything
Oh, how I wish for soothing rain
Oh, how I wish to dream again
Once and for all, and all for once
Nemo my name forevermore

Nemo my name forevermore
