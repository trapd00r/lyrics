Who be the last mother fucker breathin
Tell me nigga
Tell Me
Who be the last mother fucker breathin

Stressed
I'm busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last mother fucker breathin
Bustin'
My automatic rounds catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin

(Tupac)
Woke up with 50 enemies plottin my death
All 50 seeing visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest na nigga I was stressed
Had me creeping round corners
Homies, sleeping in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block
Call the cops, a thug nigga screaming west side busting double glocks
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got my driving up on the curb
Hand on the steering wheel swerving
Bless me father I'm a sinner
I'm living in hell, just let me live on these streets
Cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Getting world wide exposure
With a bunch of niggaz that don't give a fuck, riding as my souljahs
I'm just released, I'm on a war path,
Not your average dealer
West side, outlaw, bad boy killer
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas
Now I'm the last mother fucker breathin'


(Young Noble)
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my souljahs gone, we burnin' the earth
Outlawz world-wide, we pack the block
Shoot rocks at the kidups, bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here, stale down here
To many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me
Young Noble
Outlaw till these mother fuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'

(Napoleon)
We was raised, fuck this life
I rose my right
Holding on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm sinner too
Sleepwalking is it true?
Walkin' round town with a pound full of bitter food,
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away, with this war play
Fuck friends, I'll say
Rather die for my AK
With these fag ass niggaz
See through glass ass niggaz
Only ride my dick and scared of my mash ass niggaz
Breathin'


(Kastro)
I walk around, with a knife in my back
Talk about a bad day I live a life like that
It's severe
And I'm losing my hair
Bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm falling out flat
Yo I'm ruining
Breathin in sewer stench
No one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that
When I was still in mommy
Beside a seed that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still we breathin'

(EDI)
Totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest, man if one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one mother fucker, bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it
You hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time we drop
I know you fuckers losing it
We moving in, for the kill
For a mil', holding steel
Hold the wheel
I'm bout to give these niggaz something they can feel
(Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck)
Fakin' real
But we the raw and uncut
Style biting
Thug Line niggaz
Give it Up
We Hit Em Up

And we still real
And we still real
