[Intro: Obie Trice]
O-MIX (cry)
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice)
WHAT!

[Obie Trice]
Niggaz didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin' on a hoe's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin' up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin' on a stoop, huh?
Sippin' on a brew, plottin' to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman, a dude's version
Verses lettin' a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, branch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin'
from the same turf as yas, what nerve have yas
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who won't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's when a nigga is onboard

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
(Cry now) Cry now
(Cry now) Cry now
(Cry now) Cry now
(Cry now) Nigga cry now

[Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggaz frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin' to die, like bear huntin' with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty, but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will exceed the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggaz lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
Y'all shed tears but you can get your feel of it today

(Cry now, cry now, cry now, cry now)

[Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga

Laugh now, cry never, my beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body hard
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggaz this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros, I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks and a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy, my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin' spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggaz, and grab pine, you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Eminem] Ca$his!

[Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready with dope clips, I'm never dissin' you
My aura of war is raw to the core and the surface
of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
is to move up, pull tools, you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government with my determin'
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm "Searching for Jerry Garcia"
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, at hawk niggaz waitin' on me
You take the first shot then, "Second Round's on Me"
And when you walk on the other side, me and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scraps to get you wacked nigga
With a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what, you wack nigga?
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Clappin' down bangers is meant for entertainment, geah

[Chorus]
Cry now...

[Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll flow
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke, vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggaz
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shield us from back-stabbers and gold diggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you COPY?
You COPY?

[Chorus]
Cry now...
