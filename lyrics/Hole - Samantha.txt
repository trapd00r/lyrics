Samantha, you swore
You never turned that trick before
Keep waitin' for a war
You'll never win
You'll lose again.

Watch her wrap her legs around this world
Can't take that gutter from the girl.

Samantha
You burned me out
Samantha
It's over now
Samantha.

Your war
Was a lost 'cause before I came
Keep praying
Pray for
The pretty things you won't get back.

Watch her wrap her legs around this world
Stab the gutter right out of that girl
That girl.

Through villages of ether
My crucifixion comes.
Will you sing my hallelujah?
Will you tell me when it's done?

Look in my eyes
There's nothing there
Goodbye
I wanted you out of my whole life
Goodnight
& don't try to move.

People like you fuck people like me
In order to avoid agony
People like you fuck people like me
In order to avoid suffering.

People like you fuck people like me.
Fuck people like you.
Fuck people like me.
Fuck people like you.
Fuck people like me.
Fuck people like you.
Fuck people like me.

(Fuck people like you)
Leave your money by the bed.
(Fuck people like me)
(Fuck people like you)
In the gutter where you live.
(Fuck people like me)
& I throw it all away
& I throw it in your face
& if you were on fire
I would just throw kerosene
'Cause I love so much I hate
& I hate what you have seen in me.

Samantha!

So you think that you could save him
& we know that someone died
Oh, an unkindness of ravens
& we know that Mary lied
& through villages of ether
Oh, my crucifixion comes.
Will you sing my hallelujah?
Will you tell me when it's done?

People like you fuck people like me
In order to avoid agony
People like you fuck people like me
In order to avoid suffering.

People like you fuck people like me.
Fuck people like you.
Fuck people like me.
Fuck people like you.
Fuck people like me.
Fuck people like you.
Fuck people like me.
Fuck people like you.
