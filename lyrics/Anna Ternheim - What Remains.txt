All in his eyes, all in his eyes
The old buried lies, old buried lies
Let's start over my love, let's start over my love
With what remains, with what remains
What remains
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
All in her voice, all in her voice
The precious the false, the precious and the false
Let's get over our love, let's get over our love
No one's to blame, no one's to blame
No one's to blame

All in our hands, all in our hands
We rise and descend, rise and descend
Let's start over my love, let's start over my love
Everything changed, everything changed
Everything changed
