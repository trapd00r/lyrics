Everything in life is passing through it seems
And what you're feeling now will fade away
Like some forgotten dream
The sun will kiss your eyelids open
You'll wake to find your heart unbroken
You may not see it now
But just hold on
Because it won't last for long

Loneliness is moving in as if to stay
He's made himself at home inside your heart
There's nothing left to say
But soon the light will send him packing
He'll find the conversation lacking
You'll wake up one fine day
And he'll be gone
I know it won't last for long

Take it from a friend who's been around
Soon you'll make it to the end I know
Where new beginnings can be found

Everything in life is passing through it seems
And what you're feeling now will fade away
Like some forgotten dream
The sun will kiss your eyelids open
You'll wake to find your heart unbroken
You may not see it now
But just hold on
Because it won't last for long
Well I know it won't last for long
