Baby, let's go and get blind tonight
I'll hold your hair back and you'll hold mine, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Say it's all over, unleash the hounds
Every silver lining has a cloud, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
If you remember this tomorrow then you're doing it wrong

We're a lethal combination, too lost for therapy
Guilty by association, I'll keep you close to me
Baby, let's go and get blind tonight
I'll hold your hair back and you'll hold mine, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Say it's all over, unleash the hounds
Every silver lining has a cloud, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

And if you wake up feeling happy, you're doing it wrong
You should be in cold water with your best dress on
And me and Niagara Falls adding to all of your missed calls
If you remember this tomorrow then you're doing it all wrong

We're a lethal combination, too lost for therapy
Guilty by association, I'll keep you close to me
Baby, let's go and get blind tonight
I'll hold your hair back and you'll hold mine, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Say it's all over, unleash the hounds
Every silver lining has a cloud, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

My best friend, all my enemies
So I'll keep you close to me
