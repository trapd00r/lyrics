Hey Em, it's Paul
Umm, I listened to the new album
Umm, are you really gonna just reply to everybody who you don't like what they have to say
Uh, about you or the stuff you're working on?
I mean, I don't know if that's really a great idea
It's-it's like, what's next?
Kamikaze 2, the album where you reply to everybody who didn't like the album that you made
Replying to everybody that didn't like the previous album?
It's a slippery slope
I-I don't know if it's a really good idea
Umm, anyway, hit me back
