"You've got your world, & I've got mine, and it's a shame ...
2 grownup worlds that will never be the same ...

Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow ...
Why can't we be like Storybook Children?
In a wonderland, where nothing's planned, for tomorrow.

You've got his ring, you've got his heart, you've got his baby ...
and it's too late for us to turn and start again! ...

Why can't we be ...?
