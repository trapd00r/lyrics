I remember you,
You're the one that made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago..

I remember you,
You're the one that said, "I love you too,
Didn't you know?"

I remember too
A distant bell,
And stars that fell
Like rain, out of the blue..

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all,
I shall tell them I remember you.

I remember you,
You're the one that made my dreams come true,
A few kisses ago..

I remember you,
You're the one that said, "I love you too,
Didn't you know?"

I remember too
A distant bell,
And stars that fell
Like rain, out of the blue..

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all,
I shall tell them I remember you.
Oh, you..
Oh, you..
You..
