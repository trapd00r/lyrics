Hey you standing in the corner
Looking like a loner
Don't you want to be mine

Hey you dancing like a zombie
Feel the rhythm like me
Don't you want to be mine

You know it's Saturday tonight I got the fever
And when the music takes control you got to be there

Let's have a good time forget about the reality
Cause you and I make chemistry
Sometimes the best times of you're fantasy
Cause you and I make chemistry

Hey you put your hands on my hips
Music's loud so read my lips
Don't you want to be mine

So you I Knew the second I Saw You
You and I are just so cool
Don't you want to be mine mine mine mine

'Cause when I look into your eyes I know you got it (got it)
And when you look into my eyes you know I want it (want it)

Lets have a good time forget about the reality
Cause you and I make chemistry
Sometimes the best times of your fantasy
Cause you and I make chemistry

Good time forget about the reality
Cause you and I make chemistry
Sometimes the best times of your fantasy
Cause you and I make chemistry

I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

You know it's Saturday tonight I got the fever (fever)
And when the music take control you got to be there (be there)

Lets have a good time forget about the reality
Cause you and I make chemistry
Sometimes the best times of your fantasy
Cause you and I make chemistry

Good time forget about the reality
Cause you and I make chemistry
Sometimes the best times of your fantasy
Cause you and I make chemistry

I think I'm in love (Cause you and I make)
I think I'm in love (Chemistry)
I think I'm in love (Cause you and I make)
I think I'm in love (Chemistry)
