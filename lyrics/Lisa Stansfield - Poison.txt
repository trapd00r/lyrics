Don't worry about me, baby

Whenever you walk by me, I can here you breath
I can smell the love you made when you were gone
Darlin' don't deny it, or make excuses
I've heard too many lies, to know that I'm not wrong

Baby don't insult me
I'm too tired to let it hurt me
Baby just believe me
And give me back my key, and set me free

Keep you're body to yourself, 
Or give it to somebody else
You're poison
Can't you you see I'm far to tough to let it hurt
I've had enough of your poison

Don't lay your hands upon me
Just crawl back where you came from
I shutter at the thought of you touching me
You've stained the love I gave you 
Baby, not for long
So much I could have given you
But now you'll never know

Baby don't insult me
I'm too tired to let it hurt me
Baby just believe me
And give me back my key, and set me free

Keep you're body to yourself, 
Or give it to somebody else
You're poison
Can't you you see I'm far to tough to let it hurt
I've had enough of your poison

Got bad habits on your mind, you're underhanded
I'm not blind to your poison

Don't make me laugh, you've told so many lies
And of all the lies you told me, baby, you're the biggest

You think you've hurt me
I'm far too strong to let it get to me
Can't you see that I'm not crying anymore
So just get off my back, and leave me alone

Keep you're body to yourself, 
Or give it to somebody else
You're poison
Can't you you see I'm far to tough to let it hurt
I've had enough of your poison
