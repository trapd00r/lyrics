Brother, Minister

The Minister quietly moves behind the rostrum, takes a seat, assembles his notes, and prepares himself to take center stage, as he has done for years

Mmm
For all of my Me, I've been a little different
The categories, I never fit within them
What's my placement then with
Is it race or religion?
Sacred system and spaces in which we live in
Insights from an outsider who swims right through barbed wire
Gut laugher. Ugly crier. Pajama pants dancer. Cook with fire
Wonder what the scene is for forty year MCs which rap to white people about Islam and Black Genius
Or is he the only one living?
We should award him but which one would we give him?
Here's the bad news
I promise if they gave awards for tears and tattoos, you'd be that dude
But Starbucks outsells mochtar
The real treasure always gotta be looked for
But why do I gotta decide between compromising what I despise or just dropping all the product that I design. Nothing no dollar signs, just to be recognized, no

Get your gratitude up and your mind right
You're doing this for the divine light
