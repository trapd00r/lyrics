Song: Rachel Lampa
 
 I close my eyes,
 And even when I'm sleeping
 I'm alright,
 'Cause You are in my life.
 
 Once upon a time,
 I only imagined this
 And now You're mine.
 Oh, I tried so hard...
 Prayed that You'd find me;
 Maybe Youre here today,
 Here to remind me:
 
 If you believe that dreams come true,
 There's One that's waiting there for you.
 'Cause I believed when I saw You
 That when you want something enough,
 That it can't escape Your love.
 There is nothing in the world that cannot be...
 If you believe, oh oh...
 
 Everybody said
 That I was a fool to think
 That we could bear; (Everybody said that...)
 But I couldn't get my heart out of my head,
 And they just didn't see;
 No, they just could not.
 Feeling that You care,
 The places that You can...
 
 If you believe that dreams come true,
 There's One that's waiting there for you.
 'Cause I believed when I saw You
 That when you want something enough,
 That it can't escape Your love.
 There is nothing in the world that cannot be...
 If you believe.
 
 Never wished for material things;
 Never needed wind in my wings.
 I never wished for anything but You...oh!
 I can't explain it,
 Someone just told me,
 "Go where your heart is,
 You'll never be lonely."
 
 If you believe that dreams come true,
 There's One that's waiting there for you.
 'Cause I believed when I saw You
 That (when you believe) when You want Someone enough,
 Then they can't escape Your love.
 There is nothing in the world that cannot be,
 If you believe.
 Believe, believe, believe, ooh...
