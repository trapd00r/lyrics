So I heard y'all wanna float...

Yo, this fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring
Prime directive selects reflective aviation bathed in mood swing
(I'm broke) I know a walking corpse that spit icicle dagger to slit throat
Quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (h... o... p... e)
I paint a portrait of myself, bored life inside the tortoise shell
Tortured, orbiting Hell's orchard, intrigued but not compelled
I smell a hint of charred childflesh sweeping through my corridor
More than one canteen, a liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
How is you is the villain of my Kabuki hologram
As I hobble with hollow hands (please pin the nozzle!)
We see intent to reinvent dream application with homage to ancients
But honor modern replacements circling now basics (fresh!)
I'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tippin' the petri dish
Beached fish on the shores with a feast of wits eats the corpse
Divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible
Now that's a harp of a different color (yeah, but the song remains identical)
I am not a crook (crook)
I cook the wick at both ends just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope leaf
(Life) sight beyond, I reign where hunger pain got begone
Elong to something civil saint 'cause this Rembrandt paints on
And it's a tall canvas, lodged in the gut of Atlantis
I'm pretend, oppressive lungs, some truly learn what a death chant is
I alone personify mankind's collective soul
As the result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp evoked
Face it (die), place it on the shelf next to that portrait Mommy gave you
On the day it rained, but y'all posed by the slave ship anyway (how sweet)
Make it rain till the levy breaks
My defeatist priest is a combine of Father Time and his sweetest concubine (whine)
And it saddens me like televised casualties
I'll be hung in the village square in exactly five minutes
(You don't want to miss it!)
I've been soaking up my discontent regarding the equation
And I'm officially closed for consultation

I float
When everyone around me's busy drowning, I float
When everyone around me's busy drowning, I float
When everyone around me's busy drowning, I float
