We can go now
Go jump in the car
Sit on the roof, girl
Drank some beers, put me in the stars
Where the neon lights would lay
It's cool getting back to me
Let's forget about it

We can go forget who we are
(x2)

Let's roll around 'till i feel touching the ground
Have a drink now 'till i drift away with the stars

Let's forget about it
We can go forget who we are, yeah
(x2)

We can go forget who we are, yeah
We can go forget who we are
We can go now
We can go forget who we are
We can go now
Let's go
We can go forget who we are
We can go now
Let's go
We can go forget who we are

Go forget who we are, yeah
Go forget who we are, yeah
