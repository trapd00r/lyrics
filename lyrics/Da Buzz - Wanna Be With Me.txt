Now that I've seen this buzz in life
I don't wanna lose this feeling
Now the routine is actually nice
And I don't wanna lose this feeling

I don't want him to forget me while I'm gone
I'll be stuck thinking about him all day long
Todo el d√≠a con el chico en la cabeza
He pedido tiempo pero no me dejan

But it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)
Yeah, it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)

Now that we're chilling on my couch
I don't wanna lose this feeling
And now accidentally I'm in love
I don't wanna lose this feeling

I don't want him to forget me while I'm gone
I'll be stuck thinking about him all day long
Me da miedo que a lo lejos no recuerde
Me da miedo que se crea que me pierde

But it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)
Yeah, it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)
But it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)
Yeah, it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)

All I want is my boy
All I want is my boy
All I want is my boy
All I want is my boy
All I want is my boy

But it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)
Yeah, it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)
But it's all I ever needed from a boy
(I want, I want my boy)
Yeah, it's all I ever needed from a boy
