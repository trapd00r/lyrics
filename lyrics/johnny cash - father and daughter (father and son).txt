It's not time to make a change just relax and take it easy
You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to know
Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy

I was once like you are now and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you found somethin' going on
But take your time think a lot why think of every thing you've got
For you'll still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not

How can I try to explain 'cause when I do he turns away again
And it's always been the same same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away

It's not time to make a change just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to go through
Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy

All the times that I have cried keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard but it's harder to ignore it (oh stay)
If they were right I'd agree but it's them that know not me
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away I know I have to go away
(Oh please stay please don't go away)
