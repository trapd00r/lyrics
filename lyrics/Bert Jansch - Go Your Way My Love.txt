Drawing water from the well,
Spilling over on the grass,
Walking homeward,
My heart is filled with pain,
Woe -oh oh oh oh is me,
Go your way my love,
Go your way my love.

Drawing water from the well,
Spilling over on the grass,
Walking homeward,
My heart is filled with pain,
Woe -oh oh oh oh is me
Go your way my love,
Go your way my love.
