Always the war
In nineteen eighty three
This is the world of today
In our mind
There is only the money
And there is nothing for you
Then hours work
No flowers in the mind
The life runs without happiness
Everyday dreams
To go to a better life
But they remain only dreams
You are the children
Your life will be very hard
You are the children
You're singing every day

To have a friend
To explain your little problem
Can you say now to have it
Sometimes you hope
It's only an illusion
Don't hope, it's better so
But children power
Will win, I am sure
This is sweet lovers for us
Your fantasy
Will find new nice colours
But now it's time to go
You are the children
Your life will be very hard
You are the children
You're singing every day
