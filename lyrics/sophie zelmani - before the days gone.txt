You've been gone so long that I don't know how to welcome you, when you get here
You've been gone so long I must spend some time to get prepared
You've been gone so long so the things I'd tell you don't seem to matter
You've been gone so long it's been quite a while since things around me started to get better
I've been alone so I've got used to the nights, and the mornings and my new habits
It's changed the tones so the rhythm slowly took our dance into the shadows
It's coming days when I don't know if we can continue or must start over
Your stay away made me waiting like a woman for her missing soldier
You've been gone so long and I've let someone step into the picture
While you were gone I met someone and he makes our picture blurred
