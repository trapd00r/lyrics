In the comet we found there was more than just simple combinations of ice, dust and gas
There were parts from a circus and parts from party dresses
Now the best explanation for this
Is someone has a party on another planet
And we're not invited
The host has probably read the memories of endangered beautiful elephants

I know I'm mumbling crazy honey
But I can't sing you love songs now
Those songs are like sleep to us; necessary but it has to wait
Cause first I need to see what this comet is
Primary goal: get some answers
And search in labs after good results
(Who do you think you are, you're not a scientist)
(You just clean the floors here)

Nothing is mine and nothing is forever
My dream last night
Might as well just be a clever act
No we never found a party dress
And a circus
[x2]

And a thought just hits me about us
Of course we are
Why didn't I think of this before?
Of course we are, we are stardust
We are stardust
We are stardust
Of course we are, yeah

I know I'm mumbling (crazy honey)
Oh! (But I can't sing you love songs now)
(Those songs are like sleep to us; necessary) but it has to wait

We are stardust (Cause first I need to see what this comet is)
(Primary goal: get some answers)
We are stardust (And search in labs after good results)
(Who do you think you are)
I know we are, we are stardust
