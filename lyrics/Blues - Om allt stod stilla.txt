Am   G  F  E
AS A TEARS FADES AWAY    Am
AND THE DAWN DRIVES A LOVER’S EYES   G
NO MORE TEARS, THEY’RE ALL GONE      G7
JUST BELIEVE THIS WILL ALWAYS BE     Am
MY HEART IN YOUR HAND
KNOWS THAT ALL THIS BELONGS TO ME
AND LIKE A CHILD HERE I STAND
WHILE YOUR HEART SINGS INSIDE OF ME

ONE DREAM OF MY LIFE    F
ONE NIGHT IN ETERNITY     C
THE WIND WHISPERED SOFT TO ME    G F
AND HEAVEN STOOD STILL   Am

ONE SIDE OF THE DAWN
KNOWS THAT ALL THIS BELONGS TO ME
ONE CELESTIAL RHAPSODY
AND HEAVEN STOOD STILL

Am G G7
JUST BELIEVE THIS ALWAYS WILL BE    Am

ONE DREAM OF MY LIFE
ONE NIGHT IN ETERNITY
THE WIND WHISPERED SOFT TO ME
AND HEAVEN STOOD STILL

ONE SIDE OF THE DAWN
KNOWS THAT ALL THIS BELONGS TO ME
ONE CELESTIAL RHAPSODY

AND HEAVEN STOOD STILL
