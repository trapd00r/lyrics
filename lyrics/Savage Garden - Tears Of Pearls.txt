And we stare each other down
Like victims in the grind
Probing all the weakness and hurt still left behind
And we cry
These tears of pearls
We do it. Oh we do it.

Is love really the tragedy
The way you might describe?
Or would a thousand lovers
Still leave you cold inside?
Make you cry...
These tears of pearls

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away
Like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions
We keep locked away from all the world

Your kisses are like pearls,
So different and so rare
But anger stole the jewels away
And love has left you bare,
Made you cry...
These tears of pearls

Well I could be the tired joker
Pour my heart to get you in
Sacrifice my happiness
Just so I could win
Maybe cry...
These tears of pearls

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions
We keep locked away from all the world

We twist and turn where angels burn
Like fallen soldiers, we will learn
That once forgotten, twice removed
Love will be the death,
The death of you...
Baby!
C'mon darlin'
Mm, mm, mm, mm... Yeah...

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions
We keep locked away from all the world

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions
We keep locked away from all the world
