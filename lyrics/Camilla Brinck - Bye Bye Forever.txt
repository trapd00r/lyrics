Ah chiki chiki ah x3
Ah chiki chiki ah ah
Ah chiki chiki ah x4

You and me together 
seemes so good but people did not know 
about the secret
We tried to hide even from ourselves
And I wonder what it was that kept me holding on
So much hurting
Didn't know what I know now

Baby can't you see it's 
thank you and bye bye forever
I didn't know what I was looking for
I should'a known we couldn't stay together

Things I did I don't do no more
Thank you and bye bye forever
I see no reason why we should go on
Cause now I'm doing so much better
Things I did I don't do no more
Thank you and bye bye forever

Ah chiki chiki ah x3
Ah chiki chiki ah ah

Every time I see you 
I try to think of good times that we had
It's not easy when all the love you gave me was untrue
Look at me now 
Here I am standing on my own
Don't you play with me 
Didn't know what I know now 
Baby can't you see it's 
thank you and bye bye forever

I didn't know what I was looking for
I should'a known we couldn't stay together
Things I did I don't do no more
Thank you and bye bye forever

I see no reason why we should go on (should go on)
Cause now I'm doing so much better
Things I did I don't do no more
Thank you and bye bye forever

And now when you're done breaking my heart
I don't need you anymore
Time to move on
Now when you're gone

Never, never ever said goodbye before
Thank you and bye bye forever

I didn't know what I was looking for (looking for)
Should'a known we couldn't stay together (together)
Things I did I don't do no more
Thank you and bye bye forever

I see no reason why we should go on
Cause now I'm doing so much better
Things I did I don't do no more 
Thank you and bye bye forever
