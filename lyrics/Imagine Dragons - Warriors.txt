As a child you would wait,
And watch from far away,
But you always knew that you'd be the one
To work while they all play.

In youth, you'd lay...
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change,
But it was just a dream.

Here we are don't turn away, now
We are the Warriors that built this town
Here we are don't turn away, now
We are the Warriors that built this town from dust

The time will come
When you will have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies.

Farewell, I've gone
To take my throne above
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be the labour of my love

Here we are don't turn away, now
We are the Warriors that built this town
Here we are don't turn away, now
We are the Warriors that built this town from dust

Here we are don't turn away, now
We are the Warriors that built this town
Here we are don't turn away, now
We are the Warriors that built this town from dust
