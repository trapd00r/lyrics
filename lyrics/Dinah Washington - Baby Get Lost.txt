Well good morning baby, welcome back to town.
You doing so much travellin', never know when you'll be round

Yes you a fine mella' fella, but you stubbord as a mule.
You love me like an angel, but you treat me like a fool.
Oh face it daddy, don't wanna have me no double cross,
'Cause any time I'm ready, I can tell you baby get lost

Yeah you're cheating on the outside, doing anything you choose,
Better come back on the inside, 'cause you got too much to lose
Don't want no trouble, I got to be the boss
Hmm and if you can't play it my way, well now baby get lost

I could try an' stop you cheating but I just don't have the time;
I got so many men that they all standing in line
Oh papa you'll have to come across
'Cause any time I'm ready, I can tell you baby get lost
