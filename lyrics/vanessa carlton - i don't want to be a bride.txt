I like your company, got a new philosophy
Never knew such a gentleman
And you can take me on a cheap vacation
I don't want to have expectations
'Cause you could be the end of me

And I don't need a house on a hill, a swing on a tree
A grandfather clock, porcelain for tea
A garden with rose and jasmine
I wanna get drunk on a bottle of wine
No better way to pass the time
Forever by your side

But I don't want to be a bride
Apologies to your mother
But I could be your girl and share this life with you
But I don't want to wear white
You know it's too late for that
Can we keep the ever after?
Oh, could it be?

Don't need no golden ring
It'd be no match for the love you'd bring
From London to Tennessee
And we could catch a train to another life
On a whim under the moonlight
I promise you, will you promise me?

Our last names on a wooden sign
Arm in arm where the river starts to wind
Forever by your side

But I don't want to be a bride
Apologies to each other
But I could be your girl and share this life with you
But I don't want to wear white
Oh, you know it's too late for that
But can we keep the ever after?
Oh, could it be?
Just you and me
Ah, ah, ah

We will live like kings under lavender skies, skies
We will live like kings under lavender skies, skies -- we will
Built a poem we kept a rhyme
Wrapped our love in golden twine
We wrote, we wrote a legacy
Just you and me
Just like kings under lavender skies, skies
