I saw her walking down the street
He jumped down
He knocked her off her feet
And then I knew it was the end of her

He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl tonight

When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted just a little bit more

He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl tonight

When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted just a little bit more

I saw her lying on the street
He jumped down, he knocked her off her feet
That's when I knew it was the end of her

He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl
He's gonna kill that girl tonight

When I saw her walking down the street
My heart stood still and skipped a beat
Then he knocked her on the floor
But he wanted just a little bit more
