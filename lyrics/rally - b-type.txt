When I say you today
how you tried to disguise
all the feelings you've kept inside
Then my world fell apart
and I opened my eyes
giving up on my foolish pride

You may say that you've fallen
for somebody new
but I guess that you know what to do

Walk away and come with me
don't turn around
just walk away and you will see
there's still a chance that
you and I can make a new start
if you follow the road to your heart

I've been walking around
with a stone in my shoe
since the day when you said goodbye
For the wisdom I've found
I behaved like a fool
and I can't find a reason why

Now you say that you've fallen
for somebody new
but I guess that you know what to do

Walk away and come with me
don't turn around
just walk away and you will see
there's still a chance that
you and I can make a new start
if you follow the road to your heart

Walk away with me
and you will see
there's always a chance for us
if you want to go
