(Go
Go, Go, Go, Go for the soul
Go, Go, Go, Go for the soul)

It takes a fool to keep this fire burning
It takes a fool to love this much
It takes a fool to keep up with this yearning
So god bless fools like us

I believe
We've got nothing to lose in this fight
(Keep moving, baby, got to keep moving)
And I feel
I grow stronger with you by my side

(Go, Go, Go,) Go for the soul
And get into the motion
Get on your feet and dance with me
We've got the music, fire and devotion
Go, Go, Go, Go for the soul
Go, Go, Go, Go for the soul

It takes a dream to stay above the surface
It takes a dream to live and breathe
And when I dream, I dream about your face
You are the one, that makes me bleed

I believe
We've got all that it takes to come true
(Keep moving, baby got to keep moving)
And I feel
I grow stronger each day I'm with you

(Go, Go, Go,) Go for the soul
And get into the motion
Get on your feet and dance with me
We've got the music, fire and devotion
Go, Go, Go, Go, for the soul
Go, Go, Go, Go, for the soul, go for the soul

In your heart
In your mind
In your eyes
Let me drown
Let me stay
In your life

(Go, Go, Go,) Go for the soul
And get into the motion
Get on your feet and dance with me
We got the music, fire and devotion

Go, Go, Go, Go, for the soul
Go, Go, Go, Go, for the soul
Go. Go, Go, Go, for the soul
