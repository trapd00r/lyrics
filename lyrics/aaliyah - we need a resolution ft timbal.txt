**Verse 1**
Did you sleep on the wrong side?
I'm catching a bad vibe
And it's contagious
What's the latest?
Speak your heart
Don't bite your tongue
Don't get it twisted
Don't misuse it
What's your problem?
Let's resolve
We can solve
What's the causes?
It's official
You got issues
I got issues
But I know I miss you

**Chorus**
Am I supposed to change?
Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt?
Who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change?
Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt?
Who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change?
Are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt?
Will we remain?
We need a resolution
We need a resolution
We need a resolution
We have so much confusion

**Verse 2**
I want to know
Where were you last night?
I fell asleep on the couch
I thought we were going out
I want to know
Were your fingers broke?
If you had let me know
I wouldn't have put on my clothes
I want to know
Where'd you go instead?
'Cause it was four in the morning
When you crept back in the bed
I want to know
What was in your head?
Or what was in my head?
Am I supposed to change?

**Chorus 2x**

**Hook**
Baby let me know
You'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know
You'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know
You'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know
You'll let me know

(Timbaland)
Girl HOLLA!!!
You give me bits and pieces
You try to blame me when I don't even know the reason
I think it's just the season
Maybe the month
Maybe the building
Now tell me what's the reason?
Stupid yo?
Looks are deceiving
So, cut the crying
Cut the coughing
Cut the wheezing, girl
Quit the blaming
Cut the naming
Cut the sneaking, girl
I think you need some prayer
Better call a deacon, girl
So get your act right or else we won't be speaking, girl
So what's it gonna be?
Freaky Freaky, me and you?
Or is it gonna be who blames who?
I'm tired of these things
I'm tired of these scars
I think I'm gonna get me a drink
I'll call you tomorrow
(huh)
