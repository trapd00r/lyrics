[50 Cent Intro]
This is how we do it, when we do it
Like we just wanna tear the club up
We do it like there aint nothin to it
The way we do it, now everybody put your fuckin' hands up!
Lets Go!

[Nate Dogg (50 Cent) Chorus]
Heyyyy, (GGGGGG G-UNit), go ahead and have a party if you want to, (GGGGGG-GGGGGG G-UNit)
Na na na na na, i'm poppin' on, M.O.B.B!
Heyyyy, (GGGGGG G-UNit), go ahead and touch your body like you want to, (GGGGGG-GGGGGG G-UNit)
Na na na na na, i'm poppin' on, M.O.B.B!

[50 Cent Verse]
You cant body the kid, you know how i rock
Went from pumpin packs on the block, to straight to the top
So the money aint a thing now, yeah thats right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hampton's
I splurge with it, im so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, cuz i wan' go spend it
You know how a boss play a play, nigga im ballin'
If theres money to be made, i'm all in
Catch me in the cherry-red porsche, bay seats, red pipe, and
You want me to teach ya how to stunt, aite then
Tattoo's on the arm, 30 carrots on the charm
Cuz the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the don
First night if i dont hit, second night im on some shit
Third night we call it quits, i aint fuckin with the bitch
Success is much of a choice, im high off life
Another move, another mill, lets get right aight..

[Nate Dogg (50 Cent) Chorus]
Heyyyy, (GGGGGG G-UNit), go ahead and have a party if you want to, (GGGGGG-GGGGGG G-UNit)
Na na na na na, i'm poppin' on, M.O.B.B!
Heyyyy, (GGGGGG G-UNit), go ahead and touch her body like you want to, (GGGGGG-GGGGGG G-UNit)
Na na na na na, i'm poppin' on, M.O.B.B!

[Havoc Verse]
You can catch me cockin' the fifth, got me rockin' with Fif
Now that's ??drop?? you see the keys to the Bent
Got my niggaz movin' them bricks, it dont stop
In a million dollar deal homie get that glock
See dudes get comfy, money aint long 'nough
Spit one verse, my whole cribs coughed up
Ma i got a fetish, fuckin' in them porsche trucks
Curtis got one so when i finished i tossed her
Y'all in to wifin', we ??could throw?? wife in
Only fuck with bitches that got their liquor license
Shot high prices, shook all vices
Imfamous nigga, got the game in a vice grip
10 hundred K, but the flow, is priceless
Anything less, we rollin' them dices
Nuts in the sand if you aint bumpin' my shit
Shorty wanna rip to my sound in my ??light booth??

[Nate Dogg (50 Cent) Chorus]
Heyyyy, (GGGGGG G-UNit), go ahead and have a party if you want to, (GGGGGG-GGGGGG G-UNit)
Na na na na na, i'm poppin' on, M.O.B.B!

[Prodigy Verse]
Listen..
You couldn't ??out-pay?? P or VIP
My wrist could buy a bitch a PHD
My Range alone could pay for you to eat
For the next few years i'm so icey kid
My flow is long money, my face is Hollywood
My tattoo's could hit you with the thug ??hard flow??
My attitude is universal, yeah Hong Kong money
When we get back to Queen's we gon' hurt you
Cant afford to ride, you gettin' stomped out
I got a team of dimes they all dogged out
Ray the line, you up and take you out
My girls is hot man, they hard to turn down
You can hear your drawers lookin' like the Mexican
After the lil' shorty ??WaWa?? break you off a lil' bit
You so stupid, we so much rich
And who braggin', im jus tryna holla at the chicks, like
