Let me love you 
Let me be around 
I promise you, I won't make a sound 
'Cause the wind is blowing hard you see 
We'll take a ride just you and me 
Let's go down to the south of France 
But we can love 
I think there is a chance 
Go down for the holiday 
To live those happy thoughts again 

How are you gonna run at the speed of time? 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
How are you gonna breathe if you're underground? 
How many times will you try? 
How are you gonna walk at the rainbows edge? 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
Everything comes to an end 

I get to you at the speed of sound 
Really fast when you're on the run 
'Cause the world's closing in on us 
A second later we're on the bus 
You're so fine and I love her so 
So beautiful, but I have to know 
Is this real or is it just a game 
Take a ride, won't come back the same 

How are you gonna run at the speed of time? 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
How are you gonna breathe if you're underground? 
How many times will you try? 
How are you gonna walk at the rainbows edge? 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
Everything comes to an end 

And if I could be with you 
I keep on wonder why 
If this whole escapade 
Is it worth all this time? 
And if I could be with you 
I keep on wonder why 
If this whole escapade 
Is it worth all, all, all 

(1...2...1... bring it back) 

How are you gonna run at the speed of time? 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
How are you gonna breathe if you're underground? 
How many times will you try? 
How are you gonna walk at the rainbows edge? 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
Everything comes to an end 

And if I could be with you 
I keep on wonder why 
If this whole escapade 
Is it worth all this time? 
And if I could be with you 
I keep on wonder why 
If this whole escapade 
Ooh ooh wonderchild 
Everything comes to an end
