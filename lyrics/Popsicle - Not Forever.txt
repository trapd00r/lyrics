Still can't believe some of 
The things I never told 
I hardly touch the phone 
I don't know who to call 
You're my relief and you're 
The one who makes me cry 
I'm trying to figure out 
Some way 
To get on by 

Cause I can change I'm not the same 
Not forever 
What can I say I'm not OK 
I wish I was 
I want you back I want a time 
I can remember 
It's as simple as I say 
I can change I'm not the same 
Not forever 

So I got out at nights 
Take walks down easy street 
So talkative 
No matter who I see 
I wake up shaking 
Not alone but on my own 
I need some other guide 
To help 
Me get back home 

Cause I can.... 

You want this part of me 
The songlines in your mind 
That's who I'm trying to be 
And that's what you will find 
If you just let me in take me back 
Closer than we ever were 
I promise it's for real 

Cause I can... 

I have changed I'm not the same 
Not forever 
What can I say I'd be OK 
And so would you 
If you came back if you were here 
You would remember 
It's as simple as I say 
I can change I'm not the same 
It's as simple as I say 
I can change I'm not the same
