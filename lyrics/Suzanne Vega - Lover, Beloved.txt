Lover Beloved
Behold each of these
The lover pursues.
The beloved one flees

Lover Beloved
From countries apart
Each one alone
In the land of the heart
Each one alone in the land of the heart

Lover Beloved
Forever stripped bare
Turn in the night
And it's he who is there

Liar and lover
And hero, and thief
Turn in the night
And he brings no relief
Brother, or husband
He brings no relief

The man across the Styx, will send
Flowers from beyond the end
The man across the Styx will be
Her lover for eternity

Lover Beloved
Her brave cavalier
All of his love
Raising hatred and fear

Lover Beloved
Each craving the touch
Each bears the burden
Of loving too much
Each bears the burden
Of loving too much

The man across the Styx, will send
Flowers from beyond the end
The man across the Styx will be
Her lover for eternity

Lover Beloved
Behold both of these
Lover pursues.
Beloved one flees

Lover Beloved
From countries apart
Each one alone
In the land of the heart
Each one alone in the land of the heart
