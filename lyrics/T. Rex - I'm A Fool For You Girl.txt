A fool's lament is the wiseman's milkshake 

I'm standing winding staircase, seven eagles long 
Misty planet creature how could I kiss you wrong 

The Poet wished upon a star 
And dazzling bright is what you are 
I'm a fool for you girl, I'm a fool for you girl 
I'm a fool for you girl, I'm a fool for you girl 
Dripping dancing diving, lipstick of the brave 
Sullen Garbo siren, your body's all I crave 

Hot baby I'm a fool for you
