holding you closer
it's time i told you everything's going to be fine
know that you need it and try to believe it
take me one step at a time

CHOURUS:
if this ain't love
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel so good
if this ain't love
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel so good

think of tomorrow
we beg
steal or borrow
to make all we can in the sun
while we are moving
the music is soothing
troubles we thought had begun

CHOURUS

will you remember me
boy
remember me, forever will ya
just for this lifetime
you can be my past time
here arev the rules of our play, we're in it together
till i know you better
darling
darling
now what do you say

if this ain't love
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel (now)
why does it feel so good

CHOURUS:(only up to first "wy does it feel so good")

if this ain't love
(why, why, why)
why does it feel so good
