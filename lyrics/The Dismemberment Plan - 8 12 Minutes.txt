Oh, launched all the world's nukes this morning 
Hoping it would kick-start something 
Some of them went off course and hit the moon instead 
It was kinda pretty. 
Hasn't been a whole lot of looting 
On the other hand, oh, it's fucking freezing 
Someone on TV said something about going underground… 
Guess we better start digging. 
What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes? 
Was it mean, was it petty, or did you realize you were sorry 
And that you love them? 
I saw an astronomer break down on CNN 
He said, “I'm a scientist, not your fucking clergyman!
And no one's going nowhere ‘cause the cars are all frozen 
They give the power plants ten days 
But the sky is like a dome of black metal flake 
And stars bleed together in phosphorescent lakes 
And a dead black disk slides silently overhead 
It's fucking beautiful is what it is. 
What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes? 
Was it mean, was it petty, or did you realize you were sorry 
And that you love them? 
When I die I'm going to heaven 
Leave it to the cockroaches and the 7-11s 
But it'd be nice to think we could get it right down here just once…
