Everybody's talkin' at me 
I don't hear a word they're saying 
only the echoes of my mind
 
People stop and stare 
I can't see their faces 
Only the shadows of their eyes
 
I'm going where the sun keeps shining 
through the pouring rain 
Going where the weather suits my clothes
 
Banking off of the northeast wind 
Sailing on a summer breeze 
skipping over the ocean like a stone
 
I'm going where the sun keeps shining 
Through the pouring rain 
Going where the weather suits my clothes
 
Banking off of the northeast wind 
Sailing on a summer breeze 
skipping over the ocean like a stone
 
Everybody's talkin' at me 
canâ€™t hear a word they're saying 
only the echoes of my mind
 
I won't let you leave my love behind 
No I won't let you leave 
I won't let you leave my love behind 
I won't let you leave
