[Verse 1:]
People say I'm no good
And crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the morning
And get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't got no money
But I damn sure got it made

[Chorus:]
'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Verse 2:]
Preacher man talking on T.V
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
'Cause hes worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water
And I know that its true
But some times I think that preacherman
Would like to do a little walking too

[Chorus:]
But I ain't asking nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
Ya just leave this long haired country boy alone

[Verse 3:]
A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants a vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke

[Chorus]
