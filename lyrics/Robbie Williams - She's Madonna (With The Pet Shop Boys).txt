Oh, Madonna (Madonna)
Oh, Madonna (Madonna)
Oh, Madonna (Madonna)
Ooh

I don't miss you
Just who you used to be
And you don't ring true
So please stop calling me
Your 'l love you's are ten a penny
You're dropping clues
Like you've got any
You've got to choose
There's been so many, ooh ooh ooh

I love you baby
But face it she's Madonna
No man on earth
Could say that he don't want her

This look of love says I'm leaving
You're frozen now
I've done the freezing
I'm walking out, Madonna's calling me

She's got to be obscene
To be believed
That's her routine
Not what she means to me
I found myself by circumstance
Across a room where people dance
And quite by chance she danced
Right next to me

I love you baby
But face it she's Madonna
No man on earth
Could say that he don't want her

It's me no you, I've got to move on
You're younger too
But she's got her groove on
I'm sorry love, Madonna's calling me

Oh, Madonna (Madonna)
Oh, Madonna (Madonna)
Oh, Madonna (Madonna)
Ooh

I want to tell you a secret

We're having drinks
With Kate and Stella
Gwyneth's here
She's brought her fella
But all I wanna do
Is take Madonna home

I love you baby
But face it she's Madonna
No man on earth
Could say that he don't want her

It's me not you, I've got to move on
You're younger too
But she's got her groove on
I'm sorry love, Madonna's calling me
