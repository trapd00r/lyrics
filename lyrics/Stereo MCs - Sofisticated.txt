So sofisticated
I'm such a zero
So sofisticated
I'm such a zero
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
Now I'm gettin' relocated
Destination zero
I'm so dislocated
From my real born hero
You wanna see me fall
What you askin' for
I patted your behind
And ya givin' me aggro
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
So sofisticated
I'm such a loser
She knows how to use me
But I don't wanna lose her
Baby don't run
Baby don't come
Don't run
Don't come
Gonna prove them wrong
Find a place a space
To rise to now I'm moving on
She's so sofisticated
I'm such a zero
She's so sofisticated
I'm such a loser
She knows how to use me
But I'll never lose her
She's so sofisticated
So sofisticated
Say it to my face
Don't burn
Now I'm gettin' relocated
Destination zero
I'm so dislocated
From my real born hero
You wanna see me fall
What you askin' for
I patted your behind
And ya givin' me aggro
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
Don't burn
She's so sofisticated
I'm such a loser
She knows how to use me
But I don't wanna lose her
Baby don't run
Baby don't come
Don't run
Don't come
She's so sofisticated
She's so sofisticated
She's so sofisticated
She's so sofisticated
She knows how to use me
She's so sofisticated
So sofisticated
