Unlucky seventeen, already handed plans for the future
Glamour obsessed, told how to dress, and shown how to think
And I don't have a job, but I can show you how to be a slob
So many days, wasted and glazed
Sometimes I laugh aloud as I think about,
You asking me "Please can you help?"
Can't help my self

I'm not your savior, I'm not who you want me to be
A cowardly mistake I've made so many times before, refusing to break
Cut my losses ties them with you, like a good boy I'll pretend
And promise not to do it again

Do you remember when, life was so simple and permanent?
Everyone's changed, "Everyone's cool", Everyone sucks
But I can't seem to complain, Exciting and new is just not there
You're getting scared

I'm not your savior, never thought I was anyway
I'm a void with empty promises that backs out late
Never said I'd change, taking back the words that we spoke
Like a fuel tank running dry, you'll believe it when I choke
