Just lay beside me skin to skin
Baby, love me in the name of sin
I want you
So tell me why are you so shy?
Gonna make me cry
Just follow your heart and soul
Let your feeling take control
Baby, did you ever chiisin'?
Just listen to my heartbeat

I feel your heartbeat, love beat
Totally emotion
Heartbeat, soul beat
Deep as an ocean
Take me but baby, don't break me
For I'm the angel that is by your side
I hear your hearbeat, love beat
Love is confession
Heartbeat
I need all of your passion burning
Oh baby, I'm yearning
For all the dreams that we could dream tonight

I feel your heartbeat
It is a love beat
I'll be the angel that is by your side

Baby, wake me up just with a kiss
'Cause you know it's all I miss
I love you, so let me feel
That all the things you do are really real
Please touch me, just everywhere
I believe that love takes care
Of all of us and what that we need
Just listen to my heartbeat

I feel your heartbeat, love beat
Totally emotion
Heartbeat, soul beat
Deep as an ocean
Take me but baby, don't break me
For I'm the angel that is by your side
I hear your hearbeat, love beat
Love is confession
Heartbeat
I need all of your passion burning
Oh baby, I'm yearning
For all the dreams that we could dream tonight

I feel your heartbeat
It is a love beat
I'll be the angel that is by your side

I feel your heartbeat
It is a love beat
I'll be the angel that is by your side

Heartbeat, love beat
Totally emotion
Heartbeat, soul beat
Deep as an ocean
Take me but baby, don't break me
For I'm the angel that is by your side
I hear your hearbeat, love beat
Love is confession
Heartbeat
I need all of your passion burning
Oh baby, I'm yearning
For all the dreams that we could dream tonight

I feel your heartbeat
It is a love beat
I'll be the angel that is by your side

I feel your heartbeat
It is a love beat
I'll be the angel that is by your side
