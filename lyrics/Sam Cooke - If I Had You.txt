If I had you honey
I'd be happy
If I had you
How happy I would be

If I had you, sweetheart
I'd be so happy
How I wish you'd belong to me
If I had you
I know I have riches
If I had you
How rich I would be
If I had you, baby
I have so many riches
How I wish you belong to me

Baby, baby
Don't you hear me calling
If I had you I know
I'd be happy
If I had you, baby
How happy I would be
If I had you
I'd be so happy
How I wish you belong to me
How happy I would be
If you belong to me
