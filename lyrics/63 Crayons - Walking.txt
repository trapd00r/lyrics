Rachel: Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on
Mercedes: But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
Kurt: Oh, it isn't easy but I'll try

New Directions!: If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To sir, with love

Tina & Artie: The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
Finn & Mercedes: And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend
Santana: A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
Kurt: What can I give you in return?

New Directions!: If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To sir, with love
