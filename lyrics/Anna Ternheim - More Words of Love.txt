Words of love sent by you
Any way you get them through
Words of love trouble me
Feels like someone's watching me

Love and hate lie not close
Hurt the ones we love the most
We don't need a reason to
Love, stop lovin' you

Who are you
Playing with my mind
Like I knew you
Sharing every thought
Sending words of love

I'm afraid you lost your mind
I'm gone for good and I won't come back
Fallin' out of love with you
The sad harsh and naked truth
Words of love...
Words of love...

Who are you
Playing with my mind
Like I knew you
Sharing every thought
Sending words of love
