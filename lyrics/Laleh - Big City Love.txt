Big City Love

Along the big city walls
I walked for a while
looking for that face
I always recognise 
hello hello
it's been a while
ages ago
but your voice still feels

this it what they call 
big city love
just play it by heart
'cause I believe in true love
this is what they call big city love
play it by heart
though it's a sad sad call

this it what they call,
big city love
'cause I believe in true love

there's no where to fall 
along the city walls
along the city walls

...

And all the letters that you wrote
I want them all gone
I send them back to you
with a red heart on them
and in my memories I'll try
erasing you for good
and all the hopes I had
projected on you

was looking for
was looking for
a place to hide away,  to hide away
instead I lost, instead I lost the
heart I gave away,
oh we sang those songs
sang those songs
you comfort me you comfort me
and now and now
let's call it destiny

This is what they call 
big city love
play it by heart
cause I believe in true love
this is what they call 
big city love
play it by heart
though its a sad sad call
This is what they call 
big city love
play it by heart
because I believe in true love

(Repeat)

There's no where to fall 
along the city walls.
