he doesn't mean a thing to me, 
just another pretty face to see, 
cos all of the time, not that I'm dying for this, 
and I'd never let him next to me, 

He's the kind of guy who thinks he's smart, 
he's the type that always looks the part, 
he's on the make, he's on the take, 
and I'd never let him touch my heart, 

He didn't mean to catch my eye, 
well he's lucky he just walked on by, 
If he ever met, a girl like me, 
are you kidding? 
well I'd tell him that i'd rather die....
