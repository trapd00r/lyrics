Hello (hello), allow me to introduce myself
My name is, Shady, so nice to meet you (so nice to meet you)
It's been a long time, I’m sorry I’ve been away so long
My name is, Shady, I never meant to leave you (never meant to leave you)

You see that chick in the gym checkin’ me out
Any second I'm 'bout, to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I’m recklessly wreckin’ the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now
There’s the necklace I lost right next to Stephanie’s blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope guess I’ll re-route maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oop jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatchet the feelin' you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet, ata-ta-tackin' a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like 40 some Xanax's
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dances
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 44D and 40's with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya

Girl I don’t mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating baby, my little friends waiting to say hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booties shakin' like Jell-O
Girl I don’t mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Yeah, my equilibrium's off must be the lithium
I don’t need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extra curriculum, no reason in-particular it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hon’ but what is your name, Viviane
I woke up next to ya naked and uh did we umm
Of course we did, but didn’t I strap jimmy hon
I’m lookin’ for the torn wrapper but there don’t seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don’t mean any harm
But disease is something I’m trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I’m cool I immediately run, like Speedy Gon-
zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of Three’s I’m fiendin’ for some
My head is poundin’ to the beat of the drum

Girl I don’t mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have any thing on you that make my mood mellow
Some are oval and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don’t mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Oh those are the days they certainly were
It’s hurtin’ me to know that I’ll be closin’ that curtain for good
(Wor-wor-wor-word) I second that and a third
Rushed to emergency surg-
ery to try to flush me, because of the drugs that he purchased
He’s no longer getting them free, hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus it’s getting to be, where he’ll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin’ him
Tirelessly on the phone tryin’ to rustle up muscle relaxers
For his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he’s doublin’ backwards and he’s stumblin’ back
Slipped and fell hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now he’s up in the bathroom like he’s bustin’ a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I’m just bustin’ my own chops, while I’m bustin’ a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it I’m back

Girl I don’t mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have any thing on you that make my mood mellow
Some are oval and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don’t mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
