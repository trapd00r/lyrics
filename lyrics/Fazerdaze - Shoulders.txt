Waking soft
Waking slow
Fading into focus
Every breath
Every pulse
Holding in the moment
Every fall
Every rise and fall of your shoulders
And I'm trying not to try so hard for you
I'm trying not to try so hard for you

Wake me soft
Wake me slow
Fade me into focus
Every breath
Every pulse
I hold you in the moment
And I'm trying not to try so hard for you
I'm trying not to try so hard for you
