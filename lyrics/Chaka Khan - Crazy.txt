I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue
I know
You'd love me as long as you wanted
Then someday
Leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry
Wond'ring
What in the world did I do
Crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for crying
I'm crazy for trying
I'm crazy for loving you
