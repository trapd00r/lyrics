(Chuck D sample: "Hear my jam with the funky piano") [scratched 4x]

Straight from Brooklyn, from out the projects,
it's DJ Scratch, so girls fix your Kotex.
The Ruler; not Slick Rick, but the ruler on the mix,
with ten or more tricks.
Take flicks, prick, but please don't miss this:
watch my DJ cut with his dick.
Yeah, slick ain't it?  See your moms fainted,
Technique 1200, and watch scratch train it.
I'm-a step off and let Scratch collect dough,
while you hear my jam with the funky piano.

("Hear my jam with the funky piano") [scratched 4x]]
("Here with the movement of his hands")

("Who is the best?") [scratch] ("Me!") [scratch]
("Stop lying") ("Go ask her mother") {all 4x}
[scratch]

PMD:
A brief description, yeah, bust my DJ on the mix.
No line switch, two transform, cuts wit his lips.
And feeds up and down is extra weak,
he strictly cross-fades club mixes every week.
Won't break a sweat, the man's sharp on the blade.
Real name George Spivey, sports a high-top fade.
Brothers starin' shocked while the brother is rockin'.
No arrows on the record or marks, or needle poppin'.
From table to table, sports a Gucci cable.
EPMD's the group, Def Jam is the label.
Now I'm-a step off while Scratch collects his dough,
or rock a funky scratch to the funky piano.
