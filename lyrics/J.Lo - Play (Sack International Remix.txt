I could wait all night and day
To go to a party sit down and wait
Give my request to the dj cuz my song heâs gotta play
And when I hear that beat I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
Heâs playin my song

Play, come on play that song,
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on dj play that song you know that it turns me on
(dj just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn it on

Dj just play that song, cuz I wanna be dancin all night long
Just play my, play my, play my, play my, play my favorite song

I donât care if everybodyâs gone turn it up cuz it turns me on
Keep dancin all night long, feels so right that it cant be wrong
I get chills up and down my spine whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind.
Let me hear it one more time!
