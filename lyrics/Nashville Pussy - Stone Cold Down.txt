Well something about hometown people
Kentucky
Yeah gone

Are you gonna eat that or are
You just gonna let it go to waste
We don't like that kind 'round here
Are you gonna get up or just sit there all day
It takes money to buy that beer
You gotta have beer

Well living on fied baloney and
Playing alimony how I hate this town
Where cold eyes are like lightning
Dumb words are like thunder
I feel stone cold down

Should I even get up or should I just jerk off all day
You should see the mess I made
Trying to find a girl who enjoys a doomed fate
I said, listen

Feeling like a loser before the
Game even stars how I hate this town
Where cold eyes are like lightning
Dumb eyes are like thunder
I feel stone cold down

Feel like the buzzards that been
Following me are coming 'round
Where cold eyes are like lightning
Dumb eyes are like thunder
I feel stone cold down
Stone cold down stone cold down
Stone cold down
