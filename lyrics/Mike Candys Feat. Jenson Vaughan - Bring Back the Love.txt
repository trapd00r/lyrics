My tears ran dry when you said goodbye
Yeah I almost cried an ocean
And sleepless nights feeling dead inside
'Cause you've torn my heart wide open

You're like an angel
Without the halo
You give and take it away, ohhh
But I'm still faithful,
I'm on my knees and I pray, ohhh

Baby won't you bring back the
Bring back the, bring back the love
Baby won't you bring back the
Bring back the, bring back the love

I'm dying, won't you
Girl set me free you're all I need
I'm never gonna give up

So baby won't you bring back the
Bring back the bring back the love
Bring back the love

Bring back the love yeah

Baby, won't you bring back the love

The more I try, try to say goodbye
It's like the more I stand here frozen
You toss it by, but can't escape with time
Fight but I can't wait for losing

You're like an angel
Without the halo
You give and take it away, oh
But I'm still faithful
I'm on my knees and I pray, pray,  pray

Baby, won't you bring back the,
Bring back the, bring back the love
Baby, won't you bring back the,
Bring back the, bring back the love

I'm dying, won't you
Girl, set me free, you're all I need
I'm never gonna give up

So baby, won't you bring back the,
Bring back the, bring back the love
Bring back the love

You gotta bring back the love, oh

Baby, won't you bring back the love
Bring back the love
