I used to feel blue 
My hopes became true 
How long have I searched for someone like You 
No minute goes by 
Just an ocean of view 
I still get down 
And that’s really true 
How long have I searched for someone like You 



I used to feel blue 
My hopes became true 
How long have I searched for someone like You 
No minute goes by 
Just an ocean of view 
I still get down 
And that’s really true 



I used to feel blue 
My hopes became true 
How long have I searched for someone like You 
No minute goes by 
Just an ocean of view 
I still get down 
And that’s really true
