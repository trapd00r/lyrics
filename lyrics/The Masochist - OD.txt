Mister Cook [Kirk] (Yes?)
You have a son named Robert
Robert Cook [Kirk], age seventeen (Yes)
I`m sorry, Mister Cook [Kirk]
You better come down
To the station house
Your son is dead (Dead? How?)
He died of an overdose-overdose-overdose (oh, God)

Overdose-overdose-overdose-overdose...

Yeah, Sir, do you have any drums in your house?
