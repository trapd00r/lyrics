You know, we could have had a daughter. And 
we could have named her Anna. And she would 
have been a sweetheart. But with punk rock 
manners. 

She could have supported us when we retire, 
bought us a cottage near the countryside. 

You could have taught her to play hockey. I 
could have taught her the guitar. And her 
granddad could have shown her the way to the 
bar. She could have supported us when we 
retire, bought us a cottage near the countryside. 

We would have made the neighbours jealous. 
We could have had barbecues at nights. With 
our collected brain resources, she would have 
an IQ of 155. She could have supported us 
when we retire, bought us a cottage near the 
countryside. 

She would have won the Nobel Prize and 
thanked her mama for all the good advice and 
we could have gone swimming near that cottage 
by the lake. And she'd never have to know what 
it's like when your heart breaks. 

She could have married a Kennedy! She would 
have found the cure for HIV! Well I'm real sorry 
Anna, you never got to be because your daddy 
moved on and left me. 

She could have supported us when we retire, 
bought us a cottage near the countryside.
