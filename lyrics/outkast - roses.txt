Caroline! 
(Caroline!) 
See, Caroline, all the guys would say she's mighty fine 
(mighty fine) 
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time 
And the other half either got you cussed out, or coming up short 
Yeah, dig this now, even though 
(even though) 
You'd need a golden calculator to divide 
(to divide) 
The time it took to look inside and realize that 
Real guys go for real down-to-Mars girls, yeah

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo

Caroline! 
(Caroline!) 
I said see she's the reason for the word bitch 
(bitch) 
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club 
Trying to hurry up to get to some 
Baller or singer or somebody like that 
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror 
And crash, crash, crash... into a ditch
(Just playing) 
She needs a golden calculator to divide 
(to divide) 
The time it took to look inside and realize that 
Real guys go for real down-to-Mars girls, yeah

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo

Well she's got a hottie's body, but her attitude is potty 
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty 
I said, "Shorty would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you ballin'?"
I said "Darling, you sound like like like a prostitute", pausing
Oh, so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of ATM receipt 
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak 
Trickin' off this bitch is lost 
Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat 
A neat place sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat 
No-go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless 
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers 
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom 
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank 
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like ooo poo poo
Yeah, roses really smell like ooo poo poo

Better come back down to Mars 
Girl, quit chasin' cars 
What happens when the dope gets low 
Bitch, you ain't that fine 
No way... no way... no way
Better come back down to Mars 
Girl, quit chasin' cars 
What happens when the dope gets low 
Bitch, you ain't that fine 
No way... no way... no way  

Crazy bitch

Old punk ass bitch, old dumbass bitch 
A bitch's bitch, just a bitch
Crazy bitch
Bitch, stupid ass bitch 
Old punk ass bitch, old dumbass bitch
