Yeah! (2X)

Come Follow Me!

I got all systems going nothing standing in my way, should be far down the road but I'm not.
Something's holding me back like a wild boar attack and I got you by my side but you're not.

[Bridge]
Do you remember when we thought there was no end?
A shooting star around the sky.
Do you remember when you were from heaven sent?
How far the wind could make me fly?

[Chorus]
Angels crying, when you're far away from me.
Always trying, I will make you see.
Angels crying, when you're far away from me.
No denying, we were ment to be.

Yeah! (2X)

I tumbled from the sky where I was soaring so high. I never thought that I could fall back down to the ground.
Somewhere along the ride I found we could stop the tide. It's time fro me to by another round.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Angels are crying.
When you are far away from me.
Angels are crying.
You know that we were meant to be.
Angels are crying.

Yeah!

I got all systems going nothing standing in my way I should be far down the road but I'm not.
Something's holding me back like a wild boar attack and I got you by my side but you're not.

[Chorus]
