Caress the hardest heart
Caress the hardest heart

Let the morning sun proclaim 
The light of the world 
Let the golden day unfurl 
On every wave 
On every hill 

Each angered fist uncurl 
Caress the hardest heart 
Stir the sleeping earth 
Each stone 
Each blade of grass 

The soul of the world 
Ignite a brand new day 
Let the morning sun proclaim 
A brand new start 
Caress the hardest heart 

Caress the hardest heart 
Let the morning sun proclaim 
The light of the world 
Let the golden day unfurl 
On every wave 
On every hill 

Each angered fist uncurl 
Caress the hardest heart 
Stir the sleeping earth 
Each stone 
Each blade of grass 

The soul of the world 
Ignite a brand new day 
Let the morning sun proclaim 
A brand new start 
Caress the hardest heart 

Caress the hardest heart 

The soul of the world 
Ignite a brand new day 
A brand new start 
A brand new way
