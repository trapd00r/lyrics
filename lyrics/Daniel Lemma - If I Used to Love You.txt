If I used to love you baby
Ain't nothing like I'm, I'm loving you now
And if I used to wonder 'bout you baby
It ain't nothing like I, I wonder now

I had all 'o these minstrels bring me roses, strike up the band
Everything revolves 'round you babe
Try to understand it

'Bout the way that I been loving you baby
That ain't nothing like I, like I love you now

If I used to think 'bout you baby
It ain't nothing like I'm, like I'm thinking now
And if I used to worry 'bout you honey
It ain't nothing like I, like I worry now

I'm gon' take the shiny roses
I' gon' lay them down at your door
Everyday it grows on me this love I got in store

All way that I been loving you baby
That ain't nothing like I, like I love you know
That ain't nothing, that ain't nothing baby

Like a rainbow 'round my heart babe
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)

I'm gon' take the shiny roses
I' gon' lay them down at your door
Everyday it grows on me this love I got in store

'Bout the way I used to love you baby
That ain't nothing like I, like I love you now
That ain't nothing, that ain't nothing baby
Oh no no, it ain't nothing baby, it ain't nothing baby
Like I love you now
Like I love you now

Like a rainbow 'round my heart baby
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)
Like a rainbow 'round my heart
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)

That's how strong my love is baby
Like a rainbow 'round my heart

oh that's right Lisette

That's how strong my love is baby
Like a rainbow 'round my heart
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)
That's how strong my love
(Like a rainbow 'round my heart)
Like a rainbow baby
