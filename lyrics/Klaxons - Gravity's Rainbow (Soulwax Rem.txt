Come on with me through ruined lipglock
Accross Tangian deserts we'll flock
Madcap Medusa, flank my foghorn
We'll change four seasons with our first born

All ships of sense on hyper ocean
All kites of chaos still in motion
My culture vulture such a dab hand
I'll steal you from the year 4000

Come with me, come with me 
We'll travel to infinity
Come with me, come with me 
We'll travel to infinity
I'll always be there, oh, oh, my future love
I'll always be there, for you, my future love

Your tears leave trails of tik van loof (??)
Autonoma, the rubix groom hoom
The crippled lines that I can't get to
You'd slip through time but I won't let you

Come with me, come with me 
We'll travel to infinity
Come with me, come with me 
We'll travel to infinity
I'll always be there, oh, oh, my future love
I'll always be there, for you, my future love
