Lucy Liu... with my girl, Drew... Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, Come on

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun and I pay my own bills
Always fifty-fifty in relationships

The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
I bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'
I bought it
The house I live in
I bought it
The car I'm driving
I bought it
I depend on me
(I depend on me)

All the women who're independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?

Tell me how you feel about this
Do what I want, live how I wanna live
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy bein' independent
Question: How'd you like this knowledge that I brought?
Braggin' on that cash that he gave you is a front
If you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want

The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
I bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'
I bought it
The house I live in
I bought it
The car I'm driving
I bought it
I depend on me
(I depend on me)

All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Destiny's Child
Wazzup?
You in the house?
Sure 'nuff
We'll break these people off Angel style

Child of Destiny
Independent beauty
No one else takes care of me
Charlie's Angels

Whoa
All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
