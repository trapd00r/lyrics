[Verse 1:]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then I salivate
Start off with the night quil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face...
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat

[Hook:]
Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know...

[Verse 2:]
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fuckin hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am I
Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
Shit half a vicodin why can't I?
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

[Verse 3:]
So I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm in-somniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cause that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide ain't it
So you can lie to hailie I'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor
