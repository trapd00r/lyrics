Baby
We can do it
Take our time
Do it right
We can do it
Do it

[Bridge]
Baby
We can do it
Take our time
Do it right
We can (Do it)

[Lil' Rob]
Hey what's up
That's right (What's happenin', holmes)
That's right
Lil' Rob (What's going on, ese)
Hey you know what, I feel like partying tonight, man
Ya know
Fuck yeah

One, two, three
In the place to be
It's, no other than
Little R-O-B
There's
Not another man
Who can take the place of me
You can
Just wait and see
You best be waiting patiently
People trippin' out because I party a lot
Hey what's up gente, make some noise, we gonna party or not
Walk through the chain link, dazed, I shake some, man, some straight to the keg
Say "What's up" to this huitzita just by liftin' my head
That's how I

[Chorus 1: (Fingazz) and Lil' Rob]
(Do it)
Fuck yeah, homey, and it works every time
That's how I
(Do it)
And it's getting better with every rhyme
That's how I
(Do it)
Nothin' to it, just get straight to the point
That's how I
(Do it)
I just do it, then go smoke me a joint

[Bridge]

The party's jumpin', walk up to the DJ
Say turn that shit up, ese, I want my gente to hear the musica in TJ
So make
No mistake, make the party shake like an earthquake, break the speakers, jump
The party's packed in the back, and it's just like that
Up in the front
That's how we

[Chorus 2: (Fingazz) & Lil' Rob]
(Do it)
The DJ's spinnin' and mixin' the beats
That's how we
(Do it)
Vatos, heinas, caros dance in the street
That's how we
(Do it)
Nothin' to it, we just get to the point
That's how we
(Do it)
I just do it, then go smoke me a joint

[Fingazz]
Do it [Repeat: x4]

Three, two, one
The-the-the pa-pa-party-party has just-just begun
So find yourself someone and have yourself some fun
No
Holdin' up the wall
Whoever you are
There's no
Walkin' through the pa-pa-party tryin-tryin'
Act-act like a star (Show!)

Now you know just how I am, I party a lot
Hey what's up gente, make some noise, is this a party or not
Walk through the chain link, dazed, I shake some, let's go back to the keg
Say "What's up" to this huitzita just by liftin' my head
That's how I

[Chorus 1]

[Fingazz]
Do it [Repeat: x4]

[Bridge: Repeats]
