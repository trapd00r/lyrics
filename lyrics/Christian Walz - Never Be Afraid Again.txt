I won't breathe you now, I will let you take me down
To your underworld, to your underworld,
I will follow the, rising bubbles to the sky
Like a melody, like a melody...

I will never be alone, this could be my other home

I will never be afraid again, hold your breath and count to ten
Stay for silence, stay for when I will never be afraid again
I will never be afraid, close your eyes and count to ten
Stay for silence, stay for when I will never be afraid again

It's a sudden change, from the surface to below
It's a different town, when you've gone underground
No use to SOS, when you know you gonna drown
Try to stay alive, surrender to survive...

I will never be alone, this could be my other home

I will never be afraid again, hold your breath and count to ten
Stay for silence, stay for when I will never be afraid again
I will never be afraid, close your eyes and count to ten
Stay for silence, stay for when I will never be afraid again

Find a light above the sea (oh no), cross your heart and follow me
(Like a melody tonight)
Imagine how it all could end, imagine how it all could be...
(Like a melody tonight)

I will never be afraid again, hold your breath and count to ten
Stay for silence, stay for when I will never be afraid again
I will never be afraid, close your eyes and count to ten
Stay for silence, stay for when I will never be afraid again
