Baby, baby just please change your mind
Maybe we’ll understand love at the end of time
And the answer won’t be hard to find
When it’s gone now baby
Gone now baby
Everything is repeated so bad
Tried to tell me but I couldn’t understand
And the truth is that only I can
When it’s gone now baby
Gone now baby
I’m always on the same frequency 
Girls FM, girls FM
Girls FM, girls FM
And everybody is looking like a girl to me 
Girls FM (girls FM) girls FM
Baby, baby are we all the same?
What’s on our mind, and repeating it everyday
All it’s made of is heavenly shapes
And it’s gone now baby
Gone now baby
See them play like the infinite band
Tried to hear them but you couldn’t understand
And the truth is that only you can
When it’s gone now baby
Gone now baby
I’m always on the same frequency 
Girls FM (girls FM) girls FM
And everybody’s looking like a girl to me 
Girls FM, girls FM
Girls FM, Girls FM
Girls FM, GirlsFM, Girls FM, Girls FM, Girls FM, Girls FM, Girls FM, Girls FM
Everybody’s on the same frequency
Girls FM, girls FM
Girls FM, girls FM
And everybody’s looking like a girl to me
Girls FM (girls FM) girls FM
Everybody’s on the same frequency
Girls FM, girls FM
Girls FM, girls FM
And everybody’s looking like a girl to me
