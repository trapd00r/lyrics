Something's happenin'
Everything's different,
But everything is fine, yeah

This is the good stuff,
And yesterday is only what you leave behind
It's only in your mind

You gotta talk to the one who made you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All the light in your eyes
All the light in your eyes

No use pretendin'
You never existed
Till you saw the light, yeah

You're just beginning
You haven't missed it - it's all ahead of you,
And you know what to do

You gotta talk to the one who made you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All the light in your eyes
All the light in your eyes

Here comes the world and,
She is beautifully mysterious
She's got it all and you say,
Give it to me

Nobody's happy
That's not the world I know inside
Where everybody hides

You gotta talk to the one who made you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All that light in your eyes
All that light in your eyes

You gotta talk to the one who loves you
Talk to the one who understands
Talk to the one who gave you
All the light in your eyes
All the light in your eyes

Yeah, thank you, thank you
Yeah, everything great and small
Yeah, thank you, thank you
For the light in your eyes

Yeah, thank you, thank you
Yeah, everything great and small
Yeah, thank you, thank you,
For the light in your eyes
For the light in your eyes
