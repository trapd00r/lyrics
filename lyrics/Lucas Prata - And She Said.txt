I'm driving home the road is wet its raining
But I just can't wait to get to you tonight
I thought of what we did last night its got me crazy
And I can't think of anything but you

The way you get so cool it must be freezing

Do you believe we happened for a reason?
('Cuz you know I do)
And could you believe that this was ment to be?

And she said yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah) oooh oh (oooh oh)
