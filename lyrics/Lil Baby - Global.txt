Bought her baby Gucci strollers
Just one year but I went global
Keep it real I had to grow up
Check out my neck hell-of-a glow up
These niggas cappin' that shit blow up
My dawg rappin' hope he blow up
I need my checks without no hold up
I put my city on my shoulders
I told the truth in every story about fuckin' round and showin' up

All of my whips got that new car smell
Don't get it twisted from the 'partments I just park well
Ion fuck with him, that nigga flaw send 'em to voicemail
You should get him to push up on me tell 'em how I feel
Made myself a millionaire, only took a year dawg
Thinkin' bout what I been through I can make a tear fall
Light night with them yungins in the streets we could've killed y'all
We don't do that internet beefing that's for bitches y'all
I went up to space so hate they can't (?)
I can make your bitch eat my kids every drip drop
I come from trenches we can't come outside in flip flops
I done came so far sittin' on the floor watchin' the tip-off

I put my all into this shit I work so hard to get my wrist
It broke my heart but I didn't quit
I had to ball with no assist
I got 'em all my drip
Go with his move he gone get flipped
I had to hustle for a mill
And now I'm hustling in these gyms
They gave Jock and Dee tow-hundred years whenever they call I let 'em hear it them lawyers I got gone lift they spirit them niggas know I keep it real
Sometimes I feel like the floor is giving in on me
I work so hard but I can't stop 'cause they depend on me
I tried to call her but she won't talk but now her friend want me
I see through all of my life flaws don't need no lens on me
