Where it at Where it at
Uh
(Repeat 3x)

Oh you rhyme witta slur and sum shots in his face
He rhyme witta slur tryna sound like ma$e
Listened to his tape, this lil' nigga used to sound like Case
Maybe I'm juss killin', maybe he juss snitchin
See it a whole lot different from my cell in Clinton
What I see is straight bug, straight thoro
Yeah he be a killa, you kill wit bugs
Rather look at the facts not the hype
Like who got shot and who got knifed
Who keep gettin' struck, but don't neva strike
Hope the beef go away but the feds indict
I know yo card nigga, it's so clear
You juss wanna sell record you don't want warfare
You don't wanna ride you wanna get rich and hide
These niggaz would've died if they shot me nine times
Hey it's juss for the record
Take this mob shit serious, please respect it

And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart
'Cause it's a blood comin' outta his heart
It's murdaaah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ask me how I sleep at night
Pretty cold witta slug with my heat held tight
Pray to god while I'm gone, is what underneath feels like
It's my work by the surf when they turn off the lights

You ain't kill homi (cide) 'cause if you did
Why you ain't get the pen after all of that hit
You know I know, that if you live
That shit that you spit, somebody got somebody
Somebody got jumped, somebody got cut
Yoo pac's a nigga, nobody got shot
Nobody got flushed, you screamin what what
Okay okay killa you's a slut
Think about it, enoughs enoughs
I'm tryna show 'em who's who
And what is what
I mean how can I respect you
When them niggaz that left you ain't none of 'em blessed you
(Not one body)
You know where they are, where they perform
Bust yo gun, stop makin' songs
Please no more ghetto quran
You got money now it's time to bomb
And that's juss from the top
Take this mob shit serious please respect it

And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart
'Cause it's a blood comin' outta his heart (X2)

Death of perfection as I move witout motion
Ain't no nigga in this game doin' the shit that I'm quotin'
Take a good look 'cause you'll neva a see enough of me
Might be sum otha g's tryna trace 'n' color me
But I believe in the ways of old
Slice a fools throat tryna tell on po
That shouldn't exist, fuckin' snitch
Cut of his dick, put it on his lips
You really think I was gon' let you slide
Fuckin' wit me you must be outcho mind
You really think jail was gon' make things right
Nigga I will shoot you till you lose yo life
I was mindin' my own, word got back, niggaz talkin' bout po
I was like oh, god must be ready fo this nigga to go (bye bye bye bye)
Gangland this is the mob
You got yo break come finish yo job
Juss don't get the feds involved
And I'mma reunite you wit yo moms
Rip
I guess this ain't juss music
'Cause jail only made me much mo' ruthless (nigga)
And the bitch nigga knew this
That's why he tryed to sign me to g-unit (naaw)
Tell 'em how you made me offers
(I don't want that blood I'mma godfather)
Jumped on every street corner
Hurts yo heart that you don't get that honor
The feds I paid fo that
10 years up top
I sell 'em much shop
Both of ya was blood
Took the bus wit 'cause
Went gun fo gun
I earned my lug
You, you juss pathetic
You neva bg, despite yo efforts
Take this mob shit serious, you gon' respect it
Tha's juss fo the record

And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart
'Cause it's a blood comin' outta his heart
It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ask me how I sleep at night
Pretty good witta slug and my heat me tight
Pray to god while I'm gone, is what underneath feels like
It's my work by the surf when they turn out the light

Turn out the lights lights
Turn out the light (4X)
