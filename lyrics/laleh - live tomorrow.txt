Its cold around me, the nigh t is young
the sun has fallen and I've become
the lonely one

the moon is dancing among the clouds
and my knees are shaking,
and my dreams are braking
but I know I live
But i know i live, today

I know we could live tomorrow
But I know I live today,
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait! No..

I know we could..

Taking my life in my hands!
(the power who has it?)
Taking my life in my hands!
(the power who has it?)
I don't like to wait!
no, i don't like to wait!
It's happening, It's happening..

I know we could live tomorrow
But I live today!
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait!

La-la-la, love
