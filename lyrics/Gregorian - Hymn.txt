Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you wanna see God 
You've got to move on the other side
Stand up there with your heads in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know 
You might not come down
Don't try to fly, dear God, 
You might not come down 

Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
The people said it was... a virgin birth

He told great stories of the Lord
And said he was the saviour of us all
He told great stories of the Lord
And said he was the saviour of us all
And said he was the saviour... of us all

For this we killed and nailed him up high
He rose again as if to ask us why
He ascended into the sky
As if to say in God alone you soar
As if to say in God... alone we fly. 

Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you wanna see God 
You've got to move on the other side
Stand up there with your heads in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know 
You might not come down
Don't try to fly, dear God, 
You might not come down

Valley's deep and the mountain's so high
If you wanna see God 
You've got to move on the other side
Stand up there with your heads in the clouds
Don't try to fly you know 
You might not come down
Don't try to fly, dear God, 
You might not come down
