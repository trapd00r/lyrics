MMM baby...

I see dark clouds out my window
I know the storm is coming any minute
And the thunder just confirms my fears
And I know the tears are rimming

I'll be crying unable to stop (mmm...)
Look, here comes the very first drop

'Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you, I taste you, I can not forget
Every time it rains, I get wet

Darling, I am still in love with you
As time passes by, it just intensifies
I know I'll never be with you again
I'll never find another with that kindness in his eyes

I'll be trying, unable to stop
Look, here comes the very first drop

'Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you, I taste you, I can not forget
Every time it rains, I get wet

On sunny days I'm all right
I walk in the light
And I try not to think about the love I live without

But every time it rains, I fall to pieces
So many memories the rain releases
I feel you, I taste you, I can not forget
Every time it rains, I get wet

'Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces (every time it rains)
So many memories the rain releases (many memory)
I feel you, I taste you, I cannot forget
Every time it rains, I get wet (every time it rains)

'Cause every time it rains, I fall to pieces (every time it rains)
So many memories the rain releases (many memory)
I feel you, I taste you, I cannot forget
Every time it rains, I get wet (every time it rains)
