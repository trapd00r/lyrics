As I taste the thought of you

he lights slowly changes

ust like this morning,

m doomed

o see the birth of this morning

hrough a hounded phases 


f I only knew,

our thoughts,

hen baby I would be

our bravest

ut for now, whats only true,

s to await a greater day 


ysteries of tomorrow,

hile sunshine brakes through

ts time for a dream,

o dreams and time Ill borrow,

hile awaiting the love

f you
