I just read your letter
It says that you'll be gone for a while
Everything was gettin' better
I guess I'm just a fool strung out

What to do, life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you

I wonder just how sympathetic you'll be
You've come to take me under
And I've forgotten all about me

What to do?
My life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
So tell me why you say goodbye
And tell me why you're fucking up my whole life
Fucking up my whole life

So I'm on my way
I leave today
If I get away, it'll be ok

I'm looking out a window
Into a world that's taken you from me
And I'm feeling so disgusted
How pathetic can I possibly be

What to do?
Life is through
Just wanna kill myself for you
So tell me why you say goodbye
And tell me why you're fucking up my whole life
Fucking up my whole life

So I'm on my way
I leave today
If I get away, it'll be ok

If there's
A better place you can take me
A better life you can give me
Whatever place I can start all over
Then I would
Never need what you gave me
And never need you to save me
And never feel like this life is over
If there's
A better place you can take me
A better life you can give me
Whatever place I can start all over
Then I would
Never need what you gave me
And never need you to save me
And never feel like this life is over
Feel like this life is over

So I'm on my way
I leave today
If I get away, it'll be ok
