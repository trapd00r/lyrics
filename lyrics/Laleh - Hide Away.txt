Don't tell me not to leave
Right before I go
You don't even know
What you're asking me to do
Don't tell me honey, please
I have made a choice
There's nothing in the world
You can do to change my mind

Was looking for a place to hide away
Instead I lost the heart I gave away
Tell me how could love stand a chance again
Was looking for a place to hide away
Instead I lost the heart I gave away
Tell me how could love stand a chance again

I must admit that I
Been feeling so alone
It's what I am
It's what I've been
What I've become

Don't push it, we both know
I'm falling every time
You look at me
Like you did
When you were mine, oh, you were mine

Was looking for a place to hide away
Instead I lost the heart I gave away
Tell me how could love stand a chance again
Was looking for a place to hide away
Instead I lost the heart I gave away
Tell me how could love stand a chance again
Was looking for a place to hide away but
Instead I lost the heart I gave away

I gave it away, I gave it away

Tell me how could love stand a chance
