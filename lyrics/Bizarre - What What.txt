All my ladies say What What What
And all my dogz say What What What

Ladies and gentlemen may i grab your attention
Its the dopest M.C from the midwest
Did i mention?
So clap your hands and stomp your feet
And party on down to the Bizarre kid beat
Throw your hands in the air so i can feel it
"its the big guy rappin with the idiotic _"
Forget your small talk watch Bizarre kid get wild
Garauntee to get your girl warm like a reptile
Big chubby guy comin straight from 7 mile
Your girl heard my style
And said "oo he's foul"
So tell your man to stop trippin bro
Or he gunna get rushed by 10 guys he dont even know
Representin the _, moneys wut im gettin
*still gigglin bush* , my styles forbiddin
Its the big guy, do the butterfly to the ground
And the base head bounce
Man i got that packed down
Man forget the night
We gunna party till the day
And im a strip dance at your girlfriends cabera

All my ladies say What What What What
And all my dogz say What What What What

Does Bizarre roll with Slim shady? - Yah yah
Quick to drive up in your Mercedes - Yah yah
Datin ladies nearly 80 - Yah yah
Now who in this rap game could fade me?
Some of you rap guys never heard of me
Somtimes I be in Dallas or even North New Jersy
Forget the Moet we drinkin Hen dog all night
And pass the _ so I can get high as a kite
A slow song come on its time to dirty dance
And right now Im grabbin any girl I can
Grab her butt cheeks and hold her real tight
And tell her me and you were gettin "wild the night"
Gimme your beeper number and checks before you leave
"Ai yo call me tomorow and ask for Steve"
Oh no this shit I couldnt beleive
Me and _ grabded her by her knees
Snatched outta her weed
And grabbed the car keys

All my ladies say What What What What
And all my dogz say What What What What

Now everybody throw they hands up
This aint a stick
We came to this jam
To buy _ and play a game of pick up
With any big butt freaks thats done for tha cause
And yo Bizarre was at the bar down _

Im still game spittin while you still get in
Still gettin down how we livin
Wild like we outta prison
Run our mouth, kick in doors
And im talkin to a chicken head that could be yours

Slam dancin with girls just to see they chest bump
Now everybody bu bu bum bump bump
And get down to the sounds that we can cock jump
Or mess around and get your whole dam block jumped

Watch you beeper when Im walkin throught the crowd
Witch one of ya'll actin wild, gettin loud
You still screamin that sumebody steady hatin on you
We in the parkin lot 50 deep waitin on you
Da brigade actin up and we still scrapin
Walkin back up in the club like aint nuttin happened

What What What
All my ladies say What What What
And all my dogz say What What What
All the D.J's play my cut cut cut
