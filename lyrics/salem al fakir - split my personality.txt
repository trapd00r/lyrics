Im disgusted
With myself
Can't be trusted
Just lock me up and leave
All them voices
In my head
No more choises
I'm longing for relief
I'm longing for relief
Please give me some relief
Please give me some relief

Solitary
Is how I'm living
Involuntary
I'm nowhere to be found
I've stoped believing
In tomorrow morning
In all this grieving
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
I leave the good and bad behind
It's the only way out for me
I can't trust god with my destiny
Split My Personality

Sudden thunder
Loud and clear
Through sleep and slumber
Awakes me and I see
Where I am headed
Deep down below
And then he said it
It's time to turn around
It's time to turn around
I see my back and where I'm bound
It's the only way out for me
I can trust god with my destiny
Split My Personality
