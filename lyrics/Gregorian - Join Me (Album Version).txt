Baby join me 
Baby join me 
Baby join me 

We are so young 
Our lives have just begun 
But already we're considering 
Escape from this world 
And we've waited for so long 
For this moment to come 
We're so anxious to be together 
Together in death 

Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death 
Won't you die 
Baby join me in death 
Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death 
Join me in death

This world is a cruel place 
And we're here only to lose 
So before live tears us apart let 
Death bless me with you 

Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death 
Won't you die 
Baby join me in death 
Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death 
Join me in death

This live ain't worth living 
This live ain't worth living 
This live ain't worth living 
This live ain't worth living 

Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death 
Won't you die 
Baby join me in death 
Won't you die tonight for love 
Baby join me in death 
Join me in death
