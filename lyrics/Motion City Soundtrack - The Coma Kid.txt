I need time to get it right
Always trying to illuminate the past
Questions answered, but the insight never lasts
So I won't look back
I won't look down
I'll focus on the comfort of the cold, cold ground
Comatose and singing

I need time to get it right
I need time to get it right

Always trying to decipher what it means
Hours wasted in the land of hopes and dreams
So I won't look back
I won't look down
I'll focus on the planet spinning round and round
Comatose and singing

I need time to get it right
I need time to get it right
I need time to get it right
I need time to get it right

No, I won't look back this time
I'm going to welter in this lie
Dizzy as this coma kid
With all the things I never said and never did
With all the things I never said and never did

I need time to get it right
I won't look back
I won't look down again
I need time to get it right
I won't look back
I won't look down again
I need time to get it right
I won't look back
I won't look down again
I need time to get it right
I won't look back
I won't look down again
I need time to get it right
I won't look back
I won't look down
I'll focus on the tension building pound for pound
Comatose and singing

I need time to get it right
I need time to get it right
I need time to get it right
I need time to get it right
