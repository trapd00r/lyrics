willing and able to run
I am
willing and able I'm able to come

and if I want for you now
would you come
would you run
would you bring it back around
oh, baby how

if it all went away
nothin' left to say
would you fight it or would you lay down
at the hand of your God could you see the light
oh my prince can't you see what's been found

willing and able to run
willing and able to come
I am willing, I'm willing

willing and able to run
I am
willing and able I'm able to come
