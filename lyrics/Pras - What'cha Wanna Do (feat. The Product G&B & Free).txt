Yo, yo, yo, yo, once again she's back again
Wonderin' when she gonna find life again
Makin' runs, stackin' ones, workin'-class citizen
Chosen one of Babylon
Touched for the first time like a virgin (Uh huh)
Rap's origin, blast outta Eden (Yeah)
Love the way the snake skin wrap around her bared skin
Sex on the beach, sippin' on juice and gin
Repent just to sin again, it's that yin-yang news bulletin
Stuck with me through thick 'n' thin
Like I imagine I must sound like a Gatlin'
Gettin' rowdy with my crew down in Brooklyn
Drinkin' Ginseng, not to mention, where's my hooligan

I refuse to snooze in these Hill Street Blues (Word)
It's a full time thing, just tryin' to maintain
Even little city girls go insane (Stop it)
Sometimes I wish I could press rewind
When the life I live don't seem to be mine
If I could fly away, Free be long gone
You couldn't pin me down with your zoom lens on
I stay macked out, blacked out, stacked out
Cats outta order, y'all get smacked out, uh

Ready to get this party started
Cut this track with diamonds, yeah I'm cold hearted
A bloodhound, leavin' you punks dumbfound, what now?
You done F'd up now, wha' what? Look around
If anyone asks, I say it's crime related
Them cats forgot to learn the Ten Crack Commandments
Passin' judgement when you came from the basement
