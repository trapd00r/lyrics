When did we get so lost inside ourselves?
We used to be strong, now it's like we don't care
Instead we're calling out for help
Don't know where we went wrong, but it's so hard to share

All this weight left on our shoulders
Too much for the both of us

When did it get so heavy?
This love that's in between us, we never used to feel this
Feels so heavy
Can't get up off the ground, it's weighing us down

When did we get so bad at being honest?
You got things on your mind that you don't want to say
Thought that we had made a promise
That we would never get this way

But all this weight left on our shoulders
Too much for the both of us

When did it get so heavy?
This love that's in between us, we never used to feel this
Feels so heavy
Can't get up off the ground, it's weighing us down

All these things we said that we never meant
Are we gonna let them hold us down
All these things we said that we never meant
Are we gonna let them hold us down, down

'Cause baby it's too heavy
This love that's in between us, we never used to feel this
Feels so heavy
Can't get up off the ground (can't get up off the ground)
It's weighing us down (it's weighing us down down down)
It's weighing us down down down

So heavy
When did it get so, when did it get so heavy?
