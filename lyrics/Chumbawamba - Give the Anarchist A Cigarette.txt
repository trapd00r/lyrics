Albert! Bobby! For gods sake burn it down!

[Chorus]
Nothing ever burns down by itself, every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself, every fire needs a little bit of . .

Give the anarchist a cigarette. Cos thats as close as he's ever gonna get
Give the anarchist a cigarette. Bobby just hasnt earned it yet
Give the anarchist a cigarette. The times are changing but he just forgets
Give the anarchist a cigarette. He's gonna choke on his harmonica, Albert!

[Chorus]
Nothing ever burns down by itself, every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself, every fire needs a little bit of . .

Give the anarchist a cigarette. A candy cig for the spoilt brat
Give the anarchist a cigarette. We'll get Albert to write you a cheque
Give the anarchist a cigarette. And he'll be burning up the air in his personal jet
Give the anarchist a cigarette. You know I hate every popstar that I ever met!

[Chorus]
Nothing ever burns down by itself, every fire needs a little bit of help
Nothing ever burns down by itself, every fire needs a little bit of help
[repeat]
