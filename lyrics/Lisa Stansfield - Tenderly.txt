Words have been spoken my heart has been broken
But maybe not this time
Not with you and me
Levels understanding has always been nowhere to be seen
But maybe not this time

Don't hurt my heart
Don't try too hard to be big and strong
Just sweetly release me

No rough hands can satisfy me
Baby I bruise easily
So feel it from the heart
And when you love me
Love me tenderly
Fell it from the heart
And when you love me
Love me tenderly

Loving has hurt me
Deceived and spurned me
But maybe not this time
'Cause that was in the past
How I've been scared
To put my trust in something good that may not last
But baby not this time

I know you won't hurt my heart
You won't try too hard to be big and strong
Just sweetly make love to me

No rough hands can satisfy me
Baby I bruise easily
So feel it from the heart
And when you love me
Love me tenderly
Fell it from the heart
And when you love me
Love me tenderly
