Remember the feelings, remember the day,
My stone heart was breaking, my love ran away.
This moments I knew I would be someone else 
My love turned around and I fell,

Be my bad boy, be my man,
Be my weekend lover, but don't be my friend.
You can be my bad boy, but understand 
That I don't need you in my life again.

Won't you be my bad boy, be my man,
Be my weekend lover, but don't be my friend.
You can be my bad boy, but understand 
That I don't need you again.
No I don't need you again.

Bad boy!

You once made this promise to stay by my side, 
But after some time you just pushed me aside.
You never thought that a girl could be strong,
Now I'll show you how to go on.

Be my bad boy, be my man,
Be my weekend lover, but don't be my friend.
You can be my bad boy, but understand 
That I don't need you in my life again 

Won't you be my bad boy, be my man,
Be my weekend lover, but don't be my friend.
You can be my bad boy but understand
That I don't need you again.
No I don't need you again.
