I have gone back dreaming
So you must lead me through the day
I will touch you night time
And in the loveliest way

I would feel the sunlight
But I could burn from everywhere
Now you must make me a shadow
I will shine for you in there

I can't change
I can't change
I can't change

My angel took her promise
And left with the worst of lies
How will there ever be a future
If everyone just dies?

I can't change
I can't change
I can't change

I have gone back dreaming
So you must wake me in a while
You will see me leaving
You will get my morning smiles

My angel made my difference
Like no one really can
She left me here to love you
Please love me if you can
