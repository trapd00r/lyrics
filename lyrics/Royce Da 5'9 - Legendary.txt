I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary
Legendary
I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary
Legendary, legendary

The theme song to my supplier
Plays in the key of a key
I'm like a messiah crossed with The Wire
Rapping around the Boardwalk Empire

Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life, then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light
We two of the same

God melted a Rubik's cube into fluid
And threw it in my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in a gratuitous lane
I threw twice, now I'm running through it
'Til I'm through with the game

You can find me under a black cloud, I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
If you could put a face with my style it'd be Samuel Cassel's

I switched the fire up like I am a tyranny from hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell
'Cause it's the hammer, the cannon you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail

I'm a heavyweight, I'm catastrophic when I set it like Fahrenheit 9/11
Meditate till the levees break
I tar and feather featherweight till my fetti straight
The MAC-11 will clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face

Uh, you ever look inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the iron tried?
Ryan vibes like cyanide, I am proud to say that
I've evolved, there's only one "I" in "Defying odds"

Small time arrogance parishes every time in giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC could probably find themselves
Vibing to my lost sections, I'm legendary

Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around is starting to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down

I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary
My enemies starting to fall down
I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary, legendary
(Fall down)
I'm legendary

I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap nigga's can Google this gat
'Cause we the reason why you eating we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack

Just who we hitting here? This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume I'm trying to measure up
To you when I tell you the ruler is back
In fact, as far as you new kids, what've you did?

I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past
But I'm happy to say that I've built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter
And jelly sandwich with a machete

Uh, you marry the streets than we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception
They gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Uh, now your bitch a believer

You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'ghini, I'm sitting in, riding through Pittsburgh
While I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow a blunt to joint, here's the reefer

One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know I've learned a while ago to hide power from you
I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites I'll kill you every time

Throw a nigga body around the room
Have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes, I am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better then the best dressed lie

And while you nigga's is hating, I wonder is God really an atheist
He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent because y'all been imitating
A statue of me to you is a statute of limitations

You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales, like Gladys and Patty LaBelle
I'm a big wig, my straws in the hole
Of a volcano, I'm having a big swig

Everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around is starting to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down

I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary
My enemies starting to fall down
I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary
(Fall down)

I'm legendary
I'm legendary, legendary, legendary
I'm legendary
I'm legendary, legendary, legendary
I'm legendary
