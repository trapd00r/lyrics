I miss You really wish You would come back to haunt me now 
I know You're on the other side and watching over me yeah 
I miss You really wish you would come back to haunt me 


Why did You always have to be so nice 
Why could'nt you become a poltergeist 
Slam the door, drag a chain up the stairs 
Anything to made me know You're there 

Why did You have to be a peaceful soul 
I wish sometimes You would just loose control 
I know it's crazy but this is where You should be 
Come back and haunt me now 


I know You're on the other side and watching over me yeah 
I miss You really wish you would come back to haunt me now 


(Back and haunt me now) 


You left a memorie I cant erase 
And theres no one in life can take Your place 
Now I find myself searching my mind 
Did I ever say a word unkind 

Want You to know that it would be alright 
To cause some troubble on a saturday night 
I'd love to have it on a way I used to be 
Come back and haunt me now 


I know You're on the other side and watching over me yeah 
I miss You really wish you would come back to haunt me now 

I know You're on the other side and watching over me yeah 
I miss You really wish You would come back to haunt me 


Why did You have to be a peaceful soul 
I wish sometimes You would just loose control 
I know it's crazy but this is where You should be 
Come back and haunt me now 


I miss You really wish you would come back to haunt me now 
I know You're on the other side and watching over me yeah 


I miss You really wish you would come back to haunt me now 
I know You're on the other side and watching over me yeah 


I miss You really wish you would come back to haunt me now 
I know You're on the other side and watching over me yeah 


I miss You really wish you would come back to haunt me now
