We've been together yesterday
You tried to find the only way
At the right time you'll be mine
And our love will always shine
Tell me when will you be mine

Dance will you dance with me all night
Your arms will hold me tight
We'll dance until the the mornin' light

Dance will you dance with me all night
Your arms will hold me tight
We'll dance until the the mornin' light

Dance will you dance with me all night
Your arms will hold me tight
We'll dance until the the mornin' light

I hope you come and find my heart
I've always loved you from the start
At the right time you'll be mine
And our love will always shine
Baby say that you'll be mine

Dance will you dance with me all night
Your arms will hold me tight
We'll dance until the the mornin' light

Dance will you dance with me all night
Your arms will hold me tight
We'll dance until the the mornin' light

(Dance with me all nigh-t)
