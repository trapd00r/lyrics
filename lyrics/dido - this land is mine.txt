From behind these walls
I hear your song
Oh, sweet words
The music that you play
Lights up my world
The sweetest that I've heard
Could it be
That I've been touched and turned
Oh Lord, please finally
Finally things are changing

This land is mine but I'll let you rule
I let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you know this land is mine
So find your home and settle in
Oh, I'm ready to let you in
Just as long as we know this land is mine

After all the battles and the wars
The scars and loss
I'm still the queen of my domain
And feeling stronger now
The walls are down a little more each day
Since you came, finally, finally things are changing

This land is mine but I'll let you rule
I let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you know this land is mine
So find your home and settle in
Oh, I'm ready to let you in
Just as long as we know this land is mine

Follow the days I've traveled alone
In this cold and colorless place till now
It's what I had to pay

This land is mine but I'll let you rule
I let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you know this land is mine
So find your home and settle in
Oh, I'm ready to let you in
Just as long as we know this land is mine

This land is mine and I let you rule
I let you navigate on demand
Just as long as you know this land is mine
