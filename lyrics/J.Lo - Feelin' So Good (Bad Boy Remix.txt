Rap
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is goin my way
I feel like thereâs no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
Thatâs why Iâm feeling...

Chorus
Iâm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me around...

Now that day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
Thereâs no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above Iâm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight Iâm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
Cause Iâm loving life
And tonightâs for feeling...

Chorus
Iâm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me around...
Iâm feeling so good
I knew I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should
Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me around...
