With one look
I can break your heart
With one look
I can play every part
I can make your sad heart sing
With one look
You'll know what you need to know

With one smile
I'm the guy next door
All the love you've hungered for
When I speak is with my soul
I can play any role
No words can tell
The stories my eyes tell
Watch me when I frown
You can't write that down
You know I'm right
It's there in black and white
When I look your way
You'll hear what I say
Yes,
With one look
I put words to shame


Just one look I set the screen on flame
Silent music starts to play
One tear in my eye
Makes the whole world cry
With one look
They'll forgive the past
They'll rejoice I return at last
To my people in the dark
Still out there in the dark

Silent music starts to play
With one look
You'll know all you need to know
With one look
I'll ignite the blaze
I'll return to my glory days
They'll say, "look, who's back at last!"
This time
I'm staying
Staying for good
I'll be back
Where I was born to be
With one look
I'll be me
