Lies lies lies
You love those lies
You tell them straight
Straight to my face
They feel so right
They keep you safe
And you're so...

Good at it
Oh it comes automatic
Lies more lies
I can tell they're lies
I can see right through
You have see-through eyes

Knocked down, drag your name out all across the town
I won't be your dirty little secret
Not for you, not for me, not for your other lover
I won't be your dirty little secret

Oh men like you keep me up at night
You want your women at home
And your bed on the side
You've got a telephone girl that you carry around
In your jean back pocket with her very own sound
And you're so...

Sly about it
Oh it comes automatic
Yeah, you're so good at it
A systematic habit
Sly about it
Oh it comes automatic
Yeah, you're so good at it
A systematic habit

Knocked down, drag your name out all across the town
I won't be your dirty little secret
Tell your mother, tell your brother, tell your friends, tell your teacher
I won't be your dirty little secret
I won't be your dirty little secret

Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit
Automatic systematic habit

Knocked down, drag your name out all across the town
I won't be your dirty little secret
Not for you, not for me, not for your other lover
I won't be your dirty little secret

Knocked down, drag your name out all across the town
I won't be your dirty little secret
Tell your mother, tell your brother, tell your friends, tell your teacher
I won't be your dirty little secret
I won't be your dirty little secret
I won't be, I won't
I won't be, I won't
I won't, I won't
I won't be
Knocked down
