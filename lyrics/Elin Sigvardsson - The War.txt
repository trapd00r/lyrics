"Lay down beside me, this small bed is just big enough
for leftovers of us
Our black and white world has been captured in colorful cuffs
it was all we could trust

“Couse red makes a joke about what love“s supposed to be
blue eyes are scaring the hell out of me
Beyond every promise there is more left to find
for you, for me but not for eternity
just for tonight

A distant voice is giving directions straight out to the blue
but we“re running astray
this fog makes me mixed up, I wait for clear thoughts to break through
but they“re fadin“ away

Into the night where they turn into dust
that lingers on floors among laughters and rust
There are hours to kill so let“s waste our time
for you, for me but not for eternity
just for this very night

Wuthering heights make me head for a fall
please let me fall
right into this well of deep water,
who hears my call

Things said and and done, words that mattered transformed into fuel
for our hourglass sand
Days that I thought I regretted have now become jewels
that slip trough my hands

In separate lifes we keep growing old
longing for warm hands to burn out the cold
let black and white eyes gaze into the fire
for you, for me but not for eternity
just before we retire

Among colored rules of love and decisions “bout what“s wrong or right
there is no way to rewind
But tonight, take the cuffs of our wrists, let“s pretend for a while
that we“re color blind

In a black and white eye there are no promises found
and tomorrow this time we are no longer bound
but the weight on my chest brings a thought to my mind
I know I don“t want you to leave once you“ve come around
and it scares me sometimes

Hold my hand if you“re there I“m confused, let us trip
please let me slip
when deep water turns into ice,
I wanna lose the grip"
