I can see your stars all shine on me
When I dream my little fantasy
When I fly in the sky with the birds so high
And it makes me feel like ecstasy

Feels like ecstasy in my fantasy
Will this feeling last forever
When I dream my little fantasy

Nanana...

Feels like ecstasy in my fantasy
Will this feeling last forever
When I dream my little fantasy

I can see your stars all shine on me
When I dream my little fantasy
When I fly in the sky with the birds so high
And it makes me feel like ecstasy

Feels like ecstasy in my fantasy
Will this feeling last forever
When I dream my little fantasy

Nanana...

I can see your stars all shine on me
When I dream my little fantasy
When I fly in the sky with the birds so high
And it makes me feel like ecstasy

Feels like ecstasy in my fantasy
Will this feeling last forever
When I dream my little fantasy

Nananaâ€¦
