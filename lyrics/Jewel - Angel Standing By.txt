All through the night I'll be watching over you
And all through the night I'll be standing over you
And through the bad dreams I'll be right there, baby telling you everything is gonna be all right
When you cry I'll be, be there waiting
Telling you, were never nothing less than beautiful
So don't you hurry
I'm your Angel standing by
