I killed myself today
For second life replay
I killed myself today
I had too many lives
I did it to survive
So I killed myself today
But somehow I'm not dead
I'm still inside a head
To justify what's real when truth is to believe
I killed myself to day
For second life replay
Yeah I killed myself to day
I killed myself today
For legendary fame
I blew myself away
I did it in a crowd
The echo was about
That old familiar shame
But somewhere I'll survive
To make you feel alive
So you can all reload
Your dreams and all your hopes
I killed myself today
For second life replay
Yeah I had to end this game
But I'll return tomorrow
Alive to learn again
Alive to learn tomorrow
Alive to love again
