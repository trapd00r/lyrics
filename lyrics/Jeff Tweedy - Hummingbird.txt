His goal in life was to be an echo
Riding alone, town after town, toll after toll
A fixed bayonet through the great southwest
To forget her

She appears
In his dreams
But in his car, and in his arms
A dream could mean anything
A cheap sunset on a television set could upset her
But he never could

Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird

His goal in life was to be an echo
The type of sound that floats around
And then back down like a feather
But in the deep chrome canyons of the loudest Manhattans
No one could hear him
Or anything

So he slept, on a mountain
In a sleeping bag underneath the stars
He would lie awake and count them
But the great fountain spray of the great Milky Way
Would never let him
Die alone

Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird
Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird
A hummingbird
A hummingbird
