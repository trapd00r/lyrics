Sometimes I wanna dance when nobody’s watching
But nobody’s watching anyway
A delightful fever, I gave up everything
Running into the night, memories fade away

Let’s face the fire

Sometimes I wanna dance when nobody’s watching
But nobody’s watching anyway
If I come
Open your eyes
And find me
Find me
But if you’re gone
It’s up to you
You’ll fade with me,
Yeah you will fade with me

Let's face the fire
Oh I dissolve into you
Let's face the fire
It's like no one exist but you
