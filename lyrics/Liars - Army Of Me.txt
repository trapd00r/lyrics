Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters

Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
I'm surrounded by filth

Army of me
He will avenge me

He lives in us all
Army of me
He will avenge me
You are
Parasitic Bottom Feeders
Of this
Maggots one in the same, you all make me sick
Make me
Especially you who justify your rational lives
Are all
Your killing in the name of God or country
Army of me
He lives in us all
Army of me
He will avenge me
