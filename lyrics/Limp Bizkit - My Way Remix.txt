(yes, yes y'all...to the beat y'all...rock, rock y'all...we won't
Stop)
Special
You think you're special, you do
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me
And walk around on me.

Just one more fight
About your leadership
And i will straight up
Leave your shit
Cause i've had enough of this
And now i'm pissed (yeah).

This time i'm a let it all come out
This time i'm a stand up and shout
I'm a do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway. (2x)

(p. diddy)
This is the remix
This is the remix
Bad boy
Limp bizkit

Check out my melody

(yes, yes y'all...to the beat y'all...rock, rock y'all...we
Won't stop)
