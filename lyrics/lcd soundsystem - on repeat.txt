Beats on repeat beating on me
From every car in the street
There's a constant repeat on repeat
Of your paranoid, heartbreaking beats

On repeat

It's a five song repeat beating on me
With your favourite band that helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep

Beats on repeat beating on me
On your radio, on your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio

Beats on repeat beating on me
Beats on repeat beating on me
