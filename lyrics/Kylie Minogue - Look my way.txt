I need you
But you never seem to notice me
I Want you
But I think maybe something's wrong with me

You're the one that I long for (you are the one)
I'm just tring to catch your eye, oh boy
You could mke me so happy, woh-oh

If you would look my way
I would give everything I have to you
Look my way, oh
Show me that you want me too

When I see you
You bring out a special need in me, ah
I wanna hold you
Hold you very close to me

I can't think of another (another love)
Who could make me feel the way you do
You could make me so happy, woh-oh

If you would look my way
I would give everything I have to you
Look my way, oh
Show me that you want me too

Oh, show me
Show me that you want my love
Oh, hold me
Give me what I'm dreaming of

You're the one that I long for (you are the one)
I'm just tring to catch your eye, oh boy
You could mke me so happy, woh-oh

If you would look my way
I would give everything I have to you
Look my way, oh
Show me that you want me too
