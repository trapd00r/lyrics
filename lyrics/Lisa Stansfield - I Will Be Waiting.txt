Tell me what you need to give
Let me know if I should lead you on
Take time to understand
The magic in you

Don't be frightened of the truth
'Cause the truth can only make you stronger
Have faith in what you do
Have faith in you

Whenever you call I'll be there
Baby I'll beg steal or borrow for you
'Cause baby there's so much to share in love
In love, that's why

I will be waiting for you
Waiting for time to heal your wounds
And I will be thinking of you
Knowing love will bring you back to me
'Cause our love is true

If you've been saving up your tears
Well mine's a shoulder you can cry on
It's so easy to believe
Believe in me

Only hurt cen heal the pain
All the pain thet's swelling up inside you
Gotta face up to the truth
Be true to you

Whenever you call I'll be there

Honey I'll beg steal or borrow for you
'Cause baby there's so much to share in love
In love, that's why

I will be waiting for you
Waiting for time to heal your wounds
And I will be thinking of you
Knowing love will bring you back to me
'Cause our love is true
