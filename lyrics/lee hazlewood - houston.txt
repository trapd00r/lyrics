Well it's lonesome in this big town everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name just a walkin' in the rain
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston

I got holes in both of my shoes and I'm a walkin' case of the blues
I saw a dollar yesterday but the wind blew it away
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston

I haven't eaten in about a week and I'm so hugry when I walk I squeak
Nobody calls me friend it's sad the shape I'm in
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston
[ harmonica ]
I got a girl waitin' there for me where at least she said she'd be
I got a home and a big warm bed and a feather pillow for my head
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston

I take a bus or take an old freight train I come ride or walk it's all the
Same
I'm goin' back where they know my face and I'm never gonna leave that place
I'm going back to Houston Houston Houston

Well it's lonesome in this big town everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name yeah I'm a walkin' in the rain
