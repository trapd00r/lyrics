All you overloaded 
Candy coated
Your life's imploding now

There's a risk worth taking 
A pain worth aching 
On this hollow ground

We can let go 
Don't hold on to all of life's hardest parts
When we think of stopping 
Let's keep on rocking 
The rhythm of our hearts

We can 
Break out of here 
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can 
Forget the pace
Win in our own race 
Become a broken chain
We are broken chains 
Good and broken 

Find the magic, go and grab it 
Your fate is in your hands
Come on, find a reason 
To believe in, just tell yourself

Get off your seat 
On your feet 
Raise your hands
Feel the beat
Let it ago 
Loose control 
Feel it in your soul 

Don't you know 
What you can do 
If you have faith in you 
Let's not be invisible
There's no red light in life 
Just go
