I remember when we were children playing in the fields, I loved you truely even then and you know I always will. Climbin' over creek banks down by the cotton gin. Chasin' papa's billy goat tearin' my petticoat you cried when I got a whippin'. You cried when my puppy died just because I cried.
And I've heard you laugh when in my heart I knew you wanted to cry and when the truth it might have hurt me I've heard you tell a lie and that is why I love you like I do. 

God knows I love you. God knows I do

Now I carry sweet and gentle your first baby child. I live within the bright anticipation of your smile. Even in the bad times it seems like you never gave in. Standin' behind me and fightin' for me blindly and cryin' when I get a whippin'. You cried when my puppy died just because I cried. And I've heard you laugh when in my heart I knew you wanted to cry. And when the truth might have hurt me I;ve heard you tell a lie and that is why I love you like I do

God knows I love you. God knows I do
