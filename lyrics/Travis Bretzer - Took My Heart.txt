[Verse 1]
I see you made yourself a new choice
You're not a puppet anymore
You've got to take it day by day
Break it down and find a way

[Pre-Chorus]
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way

[Chorus]
Wasted days, wasted nights
Followin' your appetite
It's gone away, at least you've got your heart and soul

Wasted mind, wasted breath
Said enough, I've talked to death
It's gone away, at least you've got your heart and soul

[Verse 2]
I see you got yourself a new voice
You're not a puppet anymore
The world is gonna count your days
Just know the things that they can't take

[Pre-Chorus]
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way, a way, a way
A way

[Chorus]
Wasted days, wasted nights
Followin' your appetite
It's gone away, at least you've got your heart and soul

Wasted mind, wasted breath
Said enough, I've talked to death
It's gone away, at least you've got your heart and soul

[Outro]
Heart and soul
Heart and soul
Heart and soul
Heart and soul
