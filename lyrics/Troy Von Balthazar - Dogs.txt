Bad people happen to things like me. 
I broke across the room in waves and drown you in your dress. 
Bad people happen to things like me. 
Dogs appear and disappear. 
It's push, push but we don't kiss. 
Everything I say to you is code for something else. 
Why do you make love like this? 
I can see the subtlety, the rising sea, suddenly. 
It's push, push but we don't kiss. 
Everything I say to you is code for something else. 
Sleep master, sleep. 
Erase something, erase something, erase something sweet. 
Bad people happen to things like me. 
Bad people happen to things like me. 
I broke across the room in waves and drown you in your dress.
