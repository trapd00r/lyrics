[Talking]
New York City
You are now rocking with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit

[Chorus:]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Nigga what you say
We get loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire fire
Fire

Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
Twenty six inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear
Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm eightys man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting raw deals
I'm only twenty one, sitting on mills

[Chorus:]

If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I ain't hit the first night, I ain't gon call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her ??
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like em small, like em tall, like em black, like em brown
She gotta be able to cum when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

[Chorus:]
