I was just looking for happines
I was just looking for happines

When the last weakness was removed
Finally alone

The mutation started
The mutation started

Every vehicle of emotion vanished
In exchange unhuman perfection

Inhuman Unhuman perfection

The mutation
Every vehicle of emotion vanished

I was just looking for happiness
I was just looking for happiness

Bones
Skin
Hair
Mouth

When the last weakness was removed
Finally alone

Mutation walking

Mones
Skin
Hair
Mouth

Left Shoulder

I was just looking for happiness
I was... '85.
I was just looking for happiness
Happiness
