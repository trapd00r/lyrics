Dj....Premier... 

(Fred Durst) 
Uh uh uh 
Who could be the boss? 
Look up to the cross 
Stranded in the land of the lost 
Standin up I'm sideways 
I'm blazin up the path 
Runnin' on the highways of rap 
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal 
Lava stamps then brands me like a bar code 
I'm bashin all the media strikes 
To keep the media dykes 
As reinforcements for the fight 
And I don't want to keep John Gotti on the phone 
I'm tangled in the zone 
I got the bees on the track 
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!) 
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now 
(Meth: Shut the fuck up!) 
I'm pluggin in them social skills 
That keep my total bills 
Over a million 
The last time I checked it 
Thank God I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it 
Wait until the second round and knock em out 

(Method Man) 
They call me Big John Stud 
My middle name Mud 
Dirty water flow 
Too much for you thug 
And can't stand the flood 
What up Doc? Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd 
The sureshot 
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn) 
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn) 
Playin wit minds 
That get you state time 
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mine 
Killa bees in the club 
Wit his ladybug 
Brought a sword to the dance floor 
Then cut her up 
Love is love all day 
Till they throw slugs 
And take another life in cold blood 
Can't feel me til its your blood 
Murder rates tremendous 
Crime is endless 
Same shit different day 
Father forgive us 
They know not what they do 
All praise is due 
I'm big like Easy 
And Big Bamboo 

Chorus(Meth) 2x 

Whats that, I didn't hear you 
(Shut the fuck up) 
Come on, a little louder 
(Shut the fuck up) 
Everybody in together now 
(Shut the fuck up) 
What huh 
(Just shut the fuck up shut the fuck up) 

(Meth) 
Headstrong, dead calm (Method and Fred: GET RIGHT ON!) 
Dead weight to dead wrong, let's get it on 
Twelve rounds I throw down, who hold crown 
Protect land wit 4 pound, Limp Bizkit 
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario 
Comin through your stereo, why risk it? 
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted 
8 essential vitamins and minerals delicious 
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis 
Knocked out they front teefers, tryin to taste mine 
Actin like they heard it through the grapevine 
Dope fiendin for the bassline 2 for 5 rhyme 
Pharmaceuticals - hard as nails to the cuticles 
Where you find that monster she beautiful 
Wu Tang and Limp Bizkit roll on the set 
Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug and inject 

(Fred Durst) 
Mic check 
So whats it all about? (bout) 
And where we gonna run? (run) 
Maybe we can meet up on the sun 
Discretion is advised 
For the blood of virgin eyes 
We limpin on the track with the Method 
So get the sunblock (sunblock) 
You gettin one shot (haa) 
Until you dissolve 
I revolve 
Around everything you got 
From outta nowhere 
Prepare 
You be blinded by the glare 
I told you not to stare 
Now you're turned into stone 
Without a microphone 
But don't you forget you're in a zone 
(So shut the fuck up) 
And take that shit back 
Cuz all your shits wack 
(Doo doo is doo doo) 
When its weighed out like that 
Burnin up your brain like a piston 
So all those that didn't listen 
Now they even knew what they were missin 
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down 
Wu Tang Clan for the crown 

Chorus 2x 

(Meth) 
It was over your head 
All day and every day 
S I N Y 10304 
Wu Tang Killa Bees 
And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T 
Y'all know the time 
Y'all know the rhyme 
It ain't easy bein greazy in a world full of cleanliness 
And, you know, all that other madness 
We gone Peace 

Limp Bizkit 
Method Man 
Rock the house y'all 
Bring it on
