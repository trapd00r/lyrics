Standing here in front of the mirror
It's going to be all right tonight
Feelin' hot, yeah, I'm on fire
I'm never ever going to tire

Tonight, it's gonna be all right
Chasing the night 
It's gonna be all right
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's going to be all right

Live my life as I choose
I paid the price, paid my dues, you know I need no alibi
Daytime troubles fading, nights intoxicating
Gonna have it all tonight, that ain't no lie

Tonight, it's gonna be all right
Chasing the night
It's gonna be all right
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night 
It's goin' to be all right

Rock all night, sleep all day
It don't matter what they say
Ain't never gonna change my ways
And I won't be back 'til Monday

Feeling exasperating, excitement generating
I'm never gonna tire
City overloading, the circuits are exploding
Ain't coming down no, I'm too weird
