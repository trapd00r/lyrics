Honey I Quit The Dope
And I Joined The Choir
I′ve got a fancy suitFor Sunday mass
With leather shoes
I've got new curtains now
For my room with a view
And I′ll change again
A gentleman
Just so I win back you, so

Honey won't you make me
And Honest Man
I will walk you home at night
I'm on my knees
My threshold needs
A bride to carry over

Honey won′t you make me
An Honest Man
I′ll hold the door each time
I've changed my ways
With you I′ll stay
At night I pray for Honesty tonight

Honey you found me out
I don't go to church at all
I′ll spend the sundays drunk
I dream of you and what once was
I guess you always knew
You never trust a con
That reverent ruse
You saw right through
I never thought so obvious

Honey won't you make me
An honest man
Even though I′m full of lies
We've waxed and waned
Like tambourines
Who's chimes have fallen silent
Honey won′t you make me
An honest man
I′ll hold the door each time
I've changed my ways
With you I′ll stay
At night I pray for honest tonight

Make me an honest man
Make me an honest man
Make me an honest man
Make me an honest man
