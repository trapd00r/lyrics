Turn on the speak it's the first time I get to talk on the speak cause you know okay
Darn those smart alec crazy cajon boy come in to my nice clean kitchens
And get into my pantry get my blackberry jim jam that I'd pick blackberries
And make a jim jam in the winter time to take out on the shrimpin' boat
And bring in a foldin' wads of wonderous waddy for my little wienies
And they come in to my blackberry jim jam in the pantry and get them all over
The nice clean kitchen table cloth the smart alec cajon boy well play the music

Well the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Leapin' cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Makin' folds of wonderous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'
Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse

Well the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Till it's time to haul 'em and come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy eatin' carmel candy
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wonderous waddy
For the livin' that I'm lovin' in between the shrimpin' sailin'

Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
Leapin' cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Makin' folds of wonderous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'
Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse
Till it's time to haul 'em come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy carmel candy eatin' chicken
Fingel lickin' dancin' rancin' mancin' tancin'
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wonderous waddy
