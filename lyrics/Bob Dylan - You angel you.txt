You angel you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing.

You angel you
You're as fine as anything's fine
I just want to watch you talk
With your memory on my mind

You know, I can't sleep at night for trying.
Yes, I never did feel this way before
I never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then give me more
And more and more and more and more.

You angel you
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
Is the way it ought to be.

You know, I can't sleep at night for trying.
Never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then give me more
And more and more and more and more.

You angel you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I swear it makes me sing.
