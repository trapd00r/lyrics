I hear the children play
With the guards of the jail
With the guards of the jail
With the guards of the jail

I’m thinking of a new name
That I could give myself
One day I’ll be myself
Oh, one day I’ll be my own

It’s been forty long years
In the desert I have been
I’ve even hit the devil’s nose
In the desert I have grown

And as the woman said
That day when I was crying out
God puts his diamonds in the sand
But then he always takes them back

Have a good day brother
Me and your sister will rise up
Like an elephant from the mud
In your carefree sleep
We will break free
We will break free...

Have a good day brother
Me and your little bro will rise up
Like an elephant from the storm
In your carefree sleep
We will break free...

And the city will be reborn
And the streets will be washed
May the streets be clean and washed
May the streets be clean and washed

And we will wave our hand
And everybody will forgive the past
And everybody will forgive the past
And everybody will forgive the past

And as the woman said
That day when I was crying out
God puts his diamonds in the sand
But then he always takes them back

Have a good day brother
Me and your sister will rise up
Like an elephant from the mud
In your carefree sleep
We will break free
We will break free...

Have a good day brother
You and my little bro will rise up
Like an elephant from the storm
In your carefree sleep
We will break free
We will break free...

Have a good day brother
Me and your sister will rise up
Like an elephant from the mud
In your carefree sleep
We will break free
We will break free...

Have a good day brother
You and my little bro will rise up
Like an elephant from the storm
In their breakfast tea
We will break free
We will break free...

I’m thinking of a new name
That I could give myself
One day I’ll be myself
Oh, one day I’ll be my own
