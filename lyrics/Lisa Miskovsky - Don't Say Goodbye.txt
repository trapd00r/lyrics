Distant voices broke
Through silence today
Bad excuses loose power
They say
Waterfalls and wonder
Walls surrounding
Like a secret heart that's pounding

Don't say goodbye...

When I died you fell in love
With me
Saw the things you always
Wanted to see
Back again distinct in my
Beliefs
After all I was the one who lied and deceived

Don't say goodbye...
