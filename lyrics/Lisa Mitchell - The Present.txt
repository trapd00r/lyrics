We just wanna be Happy, 
Happy in the Present! 

I broke out in the daylight, 
I broke out on the street 
I passed by everyone working, 
Making up dreams 

I called out to the Heavens, 
I head everyone singing, 
'We just wanna be Happyuh, 
Happy in the present!' 

Do you hear Them whisper on the Wind? 

Do you hear 'em say, 
'We just wanna be Happy, 
Happy in the Present?' 

I put one foot in front of the other, 
It don't always feel right 
Thought I saw it f;fly over ahead. 
Dark Knight of the daylight! 
Oh, I get so anxious, 
When I feel like I'm wasting 
There's no magic in regret, 
Like in the steps that I'm taking 

Do you hear Them silent like the Sun? 
Do you hear 'em say,
