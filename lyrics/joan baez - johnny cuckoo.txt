Here comes one Johnny cuckoo,
Cuckoo, cuckoo.
Here comes one Johnny Cuckoo,
On a cold and stormy night.

What did you come for,
Come for, come for?
What did you come for,
On a cold and stormy night?

I come to be a soldier,
Soldier, soldier,
I come to be a soldier,
On a cold and stormy night.

You are too black and dirty,
Dirty, dirty.
You are too black and dirty
On a cold and stormy night.

I'm just as good as you are
You are, you are.
I'm just as good as you are
On a cold and stormy night.
