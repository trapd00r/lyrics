Show me the way you break, girl
Show me the way you f-f-f-fight
You're a cavalier for all those lost at sea
And I'm renegade ship that passes in the night

All hands on deck, this is not a drill
Well you told me that there's more underneath,
So I gonna sink this ship, watch you fall to your knees
Is it worth it?

When the hands on the clock finally strike out
Are you gonna have the stories of us to write about

There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Would it kill to have some empathy with every word you said to me
You're a liar and a con, and, oh, you're a thief
Fight back all the memories, you're nothing but an enemy

My fist against a wall, now darling
Your morals against mine
Well, I can only take the high ground, sugar
If I could waste your time

It's been a long time coming, but it's time that you paid
Your debts, off, honey, for the way that you played
Long time coming, but it's time that you paid
Your debts, off, honey, for the way, the way

There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Would it kill to have some empathy with every word you said to me
You're a liar and a con, and, oh, you're a thief
Fight back all the memories, you're nothing but an enemy

There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Da da da da, da dadadada
There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Da da da da, da dadadada

With that look in her eye and a knife in her hand
It's enough to make us want to swim back to land

The captain jump ship, the bow is on fire
The bow is on fire, the bow is on fire!

There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Would it kill to have some empathy with every word you said to me
You're a liar and a con, and, oh, you're a thief
Fight back all the memories, you're nothing but an enemy

There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Da da da da, da dadadada
There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Da da da da, da dadadada
There's a fire under bow and we're going down
Da da da da, da dadadada
There's a fire, there's a fire, there's a fire, there's a fire
There's a f-f-f-fire under bow
