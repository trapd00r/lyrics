I can't get off my high horse 
And I can't let you go 
You are the one who 
You are the one who makes me feel so real yeah yeah yeah 
Oh what I'm I supposed to 
Oh what I'm I supposed to do baby 
When I'm so hooked-up on you 
Then I realise 
Oh I realise 
That you are somebody else's guy 

Oh yeah 
Why you wanna do this to me boy 

Can you remember the times we spent together 
Sharing the days in the sun 
Then I found out you were somebody else's lover 
After all the plans were made now they're shattered 
Still I can't get off my high-horse 
I can't let you go 
You are the one 
Who makes me feel so real 
Oh What I'm I supposed to do 
When I hooked so on you 
Then I realise that you're somebody else's guy 

That day in September I'm sure you can remember 
That's when all the stuff hit the fan 
You told me a lie and you didn't have an alibi 
But baby yet I still care 
You know I loved you so baby 
That I can't let you go no no 
You are the one who makes me feel so real 
Oh what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you 
And realise you're somebody else's guy 

You know I loved you so baby 
That I can't let you go no no 
You are the one who makes me feel so real 
Oh what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you 
And then realise you're somebody else's guy 

(repeat above 3 times) 

You know I loved you so baby 
That I can't let you go no no 
You are the one who makes me feel so real 
Oh what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you 
And realise you're somebody else's guy
