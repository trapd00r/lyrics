If you're travelin' to the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one the who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

See for me

If her hair is hanging down
'cause that's the way she looks best

See for me
If her hair is hanging down
That's the way I remember the best

If you go-ooo
Where the snowflakes fall
Winter river freeze

Oh yeah

And summer (?)

Please see for me-eee
If she wear a coat so warm
Keep her from all the winds

If you travel in the north country fair
Where the winds are heavy on the borderline
Please say hello
So the warm is there

She was once one true love of me
Oh yeeea
