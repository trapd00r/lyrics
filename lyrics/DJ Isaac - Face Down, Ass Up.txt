Upon initial contact with Isaacâ€™s music, 
I had envisioned him to be an ill-mannered and psychologically unstable man, 
with an extreme uneducated and barbarian frame of mind,
nothing but ridiculous jargon, shocking sexual audacity, and repulsive images of the ghetto.
 
However, after further analysis of his music, 
I can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism, 
but to make things more plain in simple to the layman.. 

I find Isaac the dopest flyest OG Pimp hustler gangsta player hardcore motherfucker living today...
To be honest I'm totally and completely on his dick, dick, dick....
