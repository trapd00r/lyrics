Something striking hard tonight
And it's causing confusion
Across the borders of my mind
Across the borders of sadness

Please someone help me out today
I don't think I handle my friends too well
Please someone try to understand
I never meant to hurt anyone

It's all for me
Nothing left for you
Nothing left for anyone
It's all for me
There's nothing left for you

Bad conscience striking hard tonight
And it's wounding me badly
I need a safer place to hide
I need new friends to forgive me

Please someone try to understand
I never meant to fail anyone

It's all for me
There's nothing left for you
Nothing left for anyone
It's all for me
There's nothing left for you

The moon might blind us
It's time to care
Well I'm so sorry
I'm not yet there

All for me
It's all for me
It's all for me
And nothing left for anyone

It's all for me
All for me
It's all for me
And nothing left for anyone
