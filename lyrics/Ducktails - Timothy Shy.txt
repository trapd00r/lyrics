When I see you, my heart turns blue

There is no more life in me
Guess I'll turn my head and hide away
Hide away
I just don't know what to say
I don't always act so shy, you
Shy, you see
I walk next to you
For a minute or two, today, today
In the hallway, I felt anticipation
I just want it to look away
When I see you, my heart turns blue
I act so shy, always around you

This happens every couple days
I see you and try to walk away, walk away
You seem to be around
In every different part of town, part of town
In that after-noon, a certain light shine my way
Shine my way
You don't have to worry
Or ever feel afraid
In fact you never have to act this way

When I see you, my heart turns blue
I act so shy, always around you
