What have I done

You are my everything
My head and my heart my mind my wing
I could give all again
I'm never sure, of anything with you

The jokes the laughs the teardrops too
The games the fun the travels too
Yes I won't do them all with you
All good things now come from you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done
To fall so hard
For you

I give my everything
My head and my heart my mind my wing
The past the present tomorrow too
I'll spend my final day with you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done
To fall so hard
For you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done
To fall so hard
For you
