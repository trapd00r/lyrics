Lovekeeper please let me out
Lovekeeper please let me out
Haven't been for so long
You keep your eyes on me
Love of mine don't lend a hand
Yours are just keeping me down
And I've been down for so long
Love likes to hold on

I hear a timebomb ticking when you come too near
Violent explosions no one but i can hear

Lovekeeper you cut me off
Words as defense aren't enough
And I've been quiet for too long
You keep your eyes on me
Lovekeeper please set me free

I hear a timebomb ticking when you come too near
Violent explosions no one but i can hear
I hear a timebomb ticking
