Arash, Timbuktu (khodam are fighat timbak)

Verse (Timbuktu): 
On a far waste to do it when, 
for be the simpelest, 
time arrive to hard, 
when it's more then the instruments, 
more chat then your messages, 
bored on the internet, 
more rap then anything you can store on your intellekt, 
i'm saying it, thinking it, 
i'm tired of you pickling, 
I'm tired, i'm not listening it, 
why you keep on whispering, 
you're blabering in sweden, 
up on nothing, wont you nothing, 
while i'm sitting there and whishing that you would shut up or something, 
wont you please, 
give that mouth of yours a rest, 
I need some peace, so you can see the door instead, 
It's been a couple of hours now give me a break, 'cause I've got no interrest in anything you say! 

Chorus (Arash): 
Na na na na na, 
bas kon harf nazan, 
khastam ghor nazan. 
(say na na na) 
Na na na na na, 
bas kon harf nazan, 
khastam ghor nazan. 

(Whistling melodi) 

Verse (Timbuktu): 
Now every time I see you, 
even call me on the telephone, 
I not can take it easy, 
if you're leaving me to hallelo, 
why you wont sees in the sez, 
with the speech from your lips, 
'cause i just see no reason for this, 
my head has spining, 
all I want to do is relax, 
why wont you take the man, 
and find somebody new to attack? 
now get up of my ear, 
and get up and get going, 
so i can kick my feet up and, 
enjoy the snacks moment 

Chorus (Arash): 
Na na na na na, 
bas kon harf nazan, 
khastam ghor nazan. 
(say na na na) 
Na na na na na, 
bas kon harf nazan, 
khastam ghor nazan.

Chorus (Arash): 
Na na na na na,

bas kon harf nazan, 
khastam ghor nazan.
