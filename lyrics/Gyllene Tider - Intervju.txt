It's easy to say "how are you?" (Oh I'm fine!) 
To talk about your ways and visions of your mind 
But it's so hard to tell someone 
what you really want say to someone 
It always ends up the same - 
You talk about fashion, fortune and fame 

What I really really wanna do is to hear your beating heart 
It's you the whole night thru, girl we'll never part 
All I wanna say to you is I want you, and I need you too 
All I really really wanna do 
is to tell you I Love You! 

It's easy to fall when you're up high in the sky 
and it's easy to recall the times I've tried to fly 
But it's so hard to tell this girl what I really 
want to say to this girl. It always ends up at her place 
watching the telly and playing some game! 

All I really really wanna do is to hear your beating heart 
It's you the whole night thru, girl we'll never part 
All I wanna say to you is I want you, and I need you too 
All I really really wanna do 
is to tell you I Love You! 

When we are together and she wants to dance 
and I just sit and wonder how it ever got this crazy 
maybe I'm a fool, maybe I'm lazy 

All I really really wanna do is to hear your beating heart 
It's you the whole night thru, girl we'll never part 
All I wanna say to you is I want you, and I need you too 
All I really really...
