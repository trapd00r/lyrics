Well I tried
But I won't give in
That's alright
'Cause I'm going to win
Now I know
I've got to let you go
Now I see
You were never meant for me

Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight
I want your hot stuff
I got to feel it
Got to have your hot stuff
Got to have your love tonight

Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back

I remember the love in your eye
When you took my hand and said goodbye
I don't know where the river flows
But now I'm free
I'm not going to go down again

Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it (Come on)
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight (Baby, baby)
I want your hot stuff
I got to feel it (I got to feel it)
Got to have your hot stuff
Got to have your love tonight

Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back

Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot

Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight (Baby, tonight)
I want your hot stuff
I got to feel it
Got to have your hot stuff
Got to have your love tonight

Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, I need it (Baby, I need it)
Looking for your hot stuff
Baby, tonight (Baby, tonight)
I want your hot stuff
I got to feel it (I got to feel it)
Got to have your hot stuff
Got to have your love tonight

Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back
Ooh yeah
I want you back

Ooh yeah
Tell me that you
Do yeah
