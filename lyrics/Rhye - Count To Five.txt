I'm all out of place
It's raining on this race
You're all out of place my babe
It's written on your face
Bring your songs to me
I'm not afraid to hear them
Bring your songs to me
I'm not afraid to heal them

You kept me waiting
I'll count to five first

How do you feel?
I want

We're running out this fable
The scene's becoming clear
But can you feel the heat in here
The sweat off my tears

I'll keep you waiting
Make you move first
You kept me waiting
I'll count to five first

How do you feel?
I want, I'm hungry for

I'll keep you waiting
Tell me how to play
Make you move first
I'll give you time to chase
You kept me waiting
Tell me how to play
I'll count to five first
I'll give you time to change
I'll keep you waiting
I'll keep you waiting
Make your move first
Make your move first
I'll make you move first
You kept me waiting
I'll keep you waiting
I'll count to five first

How do you feel?
I want you
