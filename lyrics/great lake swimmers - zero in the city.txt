Oh, you've been here before.
Minus one, split and it's done.
Getting up every day.
Minus one every way.
Oh, but nothing's the same.
Minus two, no one to blame.
Minus one in the street, A conceit in degrees.
Minus two now we're gone.
Minus you now we're done.
So turn on your inner light.
Zero in the city tonight.
Oh, you've been here before.
Minus one, split and it's done.
So turn on your inner light.
Zero in the city tonight.
Hard to feel a single thing inside.
Zero in the city tonight.
Oh, minus one.
Minus two, minus you.
