Cruella De Ville

Cruella de ville, cruella de ville
If she doesn’t scare you, no evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, cruella de ville

The glare in her look, the ice in her stare
You innocent children, you’d better beware
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, cruella de ville

First, you think think she’s a devil (she’s a devil)
And after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize, you see it in her eyes
She’s watching you from underneath a rock

That vampire bat that in she released
She ought to be locked up and never released
Like a spider for the kill, that’s old
Cruella, cruella de ville

First, you think think she’s a devil (she’s a devil)
And after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize, you see it in her eyes
She’s babi-bidi-babi-bidi-badi-bah!

That vampire bat that in she released
She ought to be locked up and tossed away the keys
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, cruella de ville
Oh! cruella
Cruella, cruella de ville

Have memory!
