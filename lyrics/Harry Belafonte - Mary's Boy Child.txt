Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day. 

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day. 

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar. 

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child 
Not a single room was in sight.

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day. 

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born.

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day.
