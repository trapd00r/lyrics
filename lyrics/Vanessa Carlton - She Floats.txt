Watchin' puddles gather rain 
Theres no better place to lay 
Shes as fine as dandelions blowin' in the wind 
Shes not thinkin' 'bout anything 
She floats 
She floats 
Floats 

Wearin' black patent mary janes 
She steps out into the rain 
She's as dry as clear blue skies 
Swallowin' you whole 
God knows secrets though I'm told 
She floats 
She floats 
Floats 

... 

She's as fine as dandelions blowin' in the wind 
Shes not thinkin', she's listening 
She floats 
She floats 
Floats 
Floats 

She floats 
She floats 
Floats
