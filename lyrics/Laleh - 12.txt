Oh please be good to me
Oh save my soul and lead me home
I've been running for far too long
Oh please be good to me

Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me

My hands are sore, carrying promises
Another war that I've lost
My time is yours, waste it carefully
You hit and run, do it gracefully

Oh please be good to me
Oh save my soul and lead me home
I've been running for far too long
Oh please be good to me

Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me

My stupid heart is always a casualty
It wants to be loved, it hates the vacancy
My time is yours, laced it carefully
If you hit and run, do it gracefully

Oh please be good to me
Oh save my soul and lead me home
I've been running for far too long
Oh please be good to me

Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Woah woah, be good to me

Be good to me
It's all I'm asking from you
You know I'm counting on you
To lead me to nirvana
Be good to me
It's all I'm asking from you
You know I'm counting on you
Be good to me
Be good to me

Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
Be good to me, good to me
