It's cold around me, the night is young
The sun has fallen and I've become
The lonely one

The moon is dancing among the clouds
And my knees are shaking,
And my dreams are breaking
But I know I live
But I know I live, today

I know we could live tomorrow
But I know I live today
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait, no...

I know we could..

Taking my life in my hands!
(The power who has it?)
Taking my life in my hands!
(The power who has it?)
I don't like to wait!
No no, It's happening, it's happening...
I don't like to wait!
No no, It's happening ...

I know we could live tomorrow
But I know I'll live today!
I know we could live tomorrow
But I don't think we should wait!

La-la-la, love
