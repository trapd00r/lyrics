I Never Thought, I Never Dreamed,
That Things Would Get The Better Of Me,
But Then, A Shadow Creep Just Behind Me.

Oh I Guess, You Can’t Run Forever On Your Own,
No, No

Chorus:
Tell Me, Tell Me,
Will You Walk With,
Just For A Little While,
Until The Feelings Gone.
(X2)

It Gets So Cruel, It Gets So Cruel Out There In The World Outside
When Your Standing, Just Standing On Your Own,
Oh, It Seems Like Every Little Part, Of Your Soul’s Exposed
And I Know Out There, No Ones On Your Side.

Chorus:
I’m Not Asking For You To Fall In Love,
For Some Great Romance,
Just Be With Me, Until The Feelings Gone.

Feelings (x3)
Gone (x3)

Chorus:
So How About You, My Shadow And Me,
Just Us Three, Just Us Three,
Walking On.
