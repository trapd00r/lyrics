Roll me a cigarette dog
They got me feeling crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motha fucka

Puffin on Lye
Hoping that it gets me high
(Makaveli the Don, representing the Outlawz)
They got a nigga goin' crazy
(Bad ass representing the LBC)
(What cha wanna do. You know how we do it.)

Time goes by
Puffin on lye
Hopin that it gets me high
They got a nigga goin' crazy

I feel crazy
(Tell 'em 'bout it)

Last year was a hard one
But life goes on
I hold my head against the wall
Learning right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental
Detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery
In which they live
Lately, for the outcome, damn I'm reckless
Check it
You don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck living blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad
Time to stop drinkin'
Rollin', in my drop top Jag
What's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came along way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry
I'm a watch for snakes
Tell Seikywa that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me and I cried for weeks
This is what came out, when I tried to speak
All I heard was

Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy

Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy

One, two, three, four
I see bloods and crips runnin' up in hell
Lookin' for a better way
My brothas and sistas it's time to bail
'Cause even thug niggas pray
Hoping God forgive me
I entered the game, look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent
Casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house
This your land
Your only son done became a man
I'm watchin time fly
I love my people do or die
But I wonder why
We scared to let each other fly
June 1-6 7-1
The day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me nigga get paid
No one can understand me
The black sheep, out-casted from my family
Now packin heat I run the streets
A young runaway live for the day
When we die
I could hear ya say

Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy

Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy

Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy

Krazy, Krazy, Krazy

God help me out here
'Cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
This money's like a strong prescription drug
It's got me addicted to the pleasure and the pain it's inflicted
Something about the paper with the pictures of the presidents' head
Damn it's like a motherfucking plague that spreads
It's epidemic
Forgotten, forgot, and it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money 'cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So you gotta stay paid, no doubt
Day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, you see death
You gotta die
Alotta my Peers didn't make it to these years to come
Dear life doing right
Or dear life leaving dumb
Who has the answers?
I wonder
I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me
That there'll be light at the end of the road
Why?
'Cause they don't even know

A million thangs run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time

You ain't gotta be in jail
Remember this tune

Time goes by
Puffing on Lye
Hoping that it get me high
Got a nigga going krazy
I feel krazy

Feelin' fucked up in this bitch
Smoke half a ounce to the head.
Drop the top. Indo. Hawaiian. Lansbread. Buddha. All that shit.
I'm fucked up in this motha fucka.
And Hennessy don't help. And Hennessy don't help.
Thug passion in this motha fucka.
Makaveli the Don putting it down to the fullest.
Maximum overload. 3 day theory.
Killuminati to your body, with the impact of a 12 gauge shoty.
Doublized slugs. No love. Straight thugs.

One time for my niggas in the jail cell.
(One time for my niggas locked up.)
One time for my niggas doin' life in hell.
One time for my niggas in the jail cell.
(One time for my niggas locked up.)
One time for my niggas doin' life in hell.
One time for my niggas on Death Row.
(For my niggas on Death Row. West side. California syle. L.A.)
One time for my niggas livin'... broke.
(You know what time it is. No doubt. Get high. Puffin' on lye.
Wonder if it get me high. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy.)
