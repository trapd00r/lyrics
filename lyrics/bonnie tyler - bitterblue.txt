I'll take the train to nowhere
This love is a sacrifice
My heart ain't big enough babe
For your paradise...
Oh darling I'm crazy - after all these years

Don't throw away my love babe
I'm not a lonely child
Tomorrow's such a long time
My dreams are running wild...
Oh Darling I'm crazy - after all these years

I gave you all my love for free
My tears are full of memories
Give me love, give me all
Baby, catch me when I'll fall tonight

Bitterblue, Bitterblue
Breaking up is hard to do
Bitterblue you know that I'm too
Proud to cry
Bitterblue, Bitterblue
I can't take my eyes off you
That's no way to say goodbye

I'll be sailing on a rainbow
If you will change your mind
Don't throw away this love babe
Love is hard to find...
Oh darling I'm crazy - after all these years

Come save a little room babe
In your heart for me
We can make it better
Love is a mystery...
Oh darling I'm crazy - after all these years

Oh I sold my heart to you
I gave you love and heaven, too
Give me love, give me all
Baby catch me when I'll fall tonight

Bitterblue, Bitterblue
Breaking up is hard to do
Bitterblue you know that I'm too
Proud to cry
Bitterblue, Bitterblue
I can't take my eyes off you
And that's no way to say goodbye

Bitterblue, Bitterblue
Breaking up is hard to do
Bitterblue you know that I'm too
Proud to cry
Bitterblue, Bitterblue
I can't take my eyes off you
And that's no way to say goodbye

And that's no way to say goodbye
And that's no way to say goodbye
And that's no way to say goodbye
