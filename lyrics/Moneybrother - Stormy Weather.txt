No, I'm not doing this to please you
Or trying to sound like something you can relate to
(Alright)
I got my friends right here beside me
(Yeah, you got it, what you need from us?)
I need a direction, man, won't you guide me
(Sure, you need to sing this stuff)

What if I do, then will I be alright?
(Oh, yeah, sure) Then hold on tight
Please guide me and my family through stormy weather

When I begin to get caught up in it
(Does something come to your mind?)
Yeah, I remember who I needed to make it
(Just sing it, baby, you'll be fine)

What if I do then will I be OK?
(Oh, yeah, sure) Then I'll pray
Please guide me and my family through stormy weather

When I'm stoned, right out of my mind
I got my friends right there to help me keep my, get my feet back on the
(Feet on the ground)

What if I do then will I be OK?
(Oh, yeah, sure) Then I'll pray
Please guide me and my family through stormy weather
What if I do then will I be allright?
(Oh, yeah, sure) Then hold on tight
Please guide me and my family through stormy weather
What if I do then will I be OK?
(Oh, yeah, sure) Then I'll pray
Please guide me and my family, yeah, oh
Through stormy weather
