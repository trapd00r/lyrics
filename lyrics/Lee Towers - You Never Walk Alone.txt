When you walk
Through a storm
Hold your head, up high
And don't be afraid, of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song
Of a lark

Walk on, through the wind
Walk on, through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed
And blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope, in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And You'll never walk, alone
You'll never walk, alone

YouÂ´ll never walk, alone

You'll never walk, alone
