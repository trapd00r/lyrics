She said to me, "Go steady on me
Won't you tell me what the wise men said when they
Came down from heaven, smoked nine till seven
All the shit that they could find

But they couldn't escape from you, couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just tryin' to have some fun"

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea

Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Really sorry now, they weren't to know
They got caught up in your talent show
With you pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress
Who just judge each other and try to impress

But they couldn't escape from you, couldn't be free of you
And now they know there's no way out
And they're really sorry now for what they've done
They were three wise men just tryin' to have some fun

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea

Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Look who's alone now
It's not me, it's not me
Those three wise men
They've got a semi by the sea

Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Gotta ask yourself the question
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
Got to ask yourself the question
Where are you now?
