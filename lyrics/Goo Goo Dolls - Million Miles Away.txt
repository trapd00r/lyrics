Friday night, I'd just got back 
I had my eyes shut, was dreaming about the past

I thought about you while the radio played 
Should have got loaded but for some reason I stayed

I started drifting to a different place 
I realized I was falling off the face of the world 
And there was nothing there to bring us back 

'Cause you're a million miles away 
A million miles away 
And there's nothing there to bring us back today 
Todayoh no

I took a ride and I went downtown 
The streets were empty, there was no one around 
I went to places that we used to go 
Seen all the places that we used to know

I'm at the wrong end of the looking glass 
I'm trying to hold on to the hands of the past and you 
And there's nothing there to bring us back 

'Cause you're a million miles away 
A million miles away 
And there's nothing there to bring us back today 
Todayoh no

'Cause you're million miles away 
A million miles away 
Just a million miles away 
A million miles away 
And there's nothing there to bring us back today 
Today'ay'ayoh no
