You make me live
I wanna say Efharisto

I'm gonna write you a song, so you'll understand
All that you see in my eyes and read in my hand
It's what I honestly feel 
This time I know that it's for real
And 'til I find the right way, this is what I wanna say

Efharisto
For all the love you give
And the way you make me live
I'll say the only word I know
Efharisto
I thank the stars above
For this everlasting love
I wanna say Efharisto

You are to me like the sun 
So warm in the sky
You are like sweet summer rain
As soft as a sigh

You're like the ocean so deep
Rocking me gently in my sleep
Don't know where I'm gonna start
So I just say it from the heart

Efharisto
For all the love you give
And the way you make me live
I'll say the only word I know
Efharisto
I thank the stars above
For this everlasting love

I say from my heart for your love
Efharisto
For all the love you give
And the way you make me live
I'll say the only word I know
Efharisto
I thank the stars above
For this everlasting love
I wanna say Efharisto

Efharisto
Efharisto
