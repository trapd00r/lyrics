It's so much easier than you think, you try so hard
And every time you get it wrong, you get it right
You get it wrong but you get it right
You get it right

The mind runs fast
Your thoughts are louder than your words
And every time you turn around
It starts to hurt, hurt, it starts to hurt
But you wanna be heard, wanna be heard, wanna be

Louder than the storms around
You hear them through the windows and the doors
Everybody's time has come
It's everybody's moment, except yours

Before the light goes out
Why don't you close your eyes
And all the monsters in your mind just wanna be nice
They wanna be kind, they wanna play nice, they wanna be

Softer than the storms around
You feel them through the windows and the doors
Everybody's time has come
It's everybody's moment, except yours

Everybody moment, everybody moment
Everybody moment except yours, 'cept yours
Everybody moment, everybody moment
Everybody moment, except yours, 'cept yours.
