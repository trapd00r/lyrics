(MC breed)

Smooth as a wanna be, for quickly you a gonna be
{O that's the way it is}
Fuck yeah and that's the way it's gonna be
Why, puffin on a dank and drinking mad brew
Taking names and after that I'm kickin ass too.
Breed, kinda of tha{can I get a ryhme to go}
Hey yo pac ill set back and design it slow.
They hate to see a young nigga, come up
Another punk, run up
And have to get his, gun up
Cause um I ain't takin' no shorts, like a newport, explortin the fully joint and
Explodin on the whole court.
And I don't wanna be, wanna be, nuttin like mike
Cause even mike don't miss every itty bitty triflin
And when you in the spotlight, you get um jocked right
But your lifes not tight.
Buckin anybody forbed mine
When will they relize, I'm set out to get mine

(2pac)

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
Finga on the trigga, nigga, hand on my nine
Smokin' blunts a skunk, makin' hoes of punks
And only underground funk bumpin outta my trunk
Live my life as a hustla, high till I die
Meetin bitches, gettin' riches, miss me when lie
Picture me living out my life as a busta
I ratha pop out a shot out my glock, and blast muthafuckas
I live that thug life baby I'm hopeless, chokin off indo
Tryin' to keep my focus
Don't let that bullshit worry me, fuck the fame, I'm true to the game
Till they bury me
God gave me game so I'm hustlin, pour out some liqour for my niggas
2pac is still strugglin
My niggga breed new the time, wether it's ryhme or crime, nigga, I gotta get mine

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

Now let me rushing threw your mind, I'm balla is what I keep gettin'
Everytime I pick up the mic and start spittin'
The sidewalk of new york will start bumpin
Jumpin' around, with the muthafuckin pound
And I'm down to the fullest, and breakin niggas ass off proper
Did you right, that's right, 'cause I got you in my pocket again
The new jacks, the new jacks, use to be my niggas when I ran way back when
I boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the clinical cause ill do it again.
Like percision, cut the two lines in the division.
Plus, what I add loose as flutes. it's gaming foe sale like prostitutes.
I never had love for hoes, to put it blunt.
They want me in the back, but bitch I'm in the front.
Don't front, and really I don't need a reply.
Pull yourself together as you pass me bye.
I'm on a whole nother level, them hoes is left
I told you befoe, keep ya pussy to yourself
Goodbye, some many niggas lied to have
Funny what a muthafucka do for math
I got rats caught up in my everday actions, point
Equal to your realist satisfaction
Buckin anybody that forbid mine
When will they reelize, I'm set out to gwt mine

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
Get yours
