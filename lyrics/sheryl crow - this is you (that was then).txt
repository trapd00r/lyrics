Every night I hold you tight and wish you'd trust me
Don't you think that's something I've earned
You think I must be lying baby when you gonna learn

That was then but it's different now
You came along and I'm changed somehow
I wouldn't leave even if you wanted me to
And that's all over yeah that's old news
Gonna prove it to you if it's the last thing I do
That was then
Oh but this is you

The people say I have a way of loving and leaving
Baby who you gonna believe
You got my heart, you got my soul
What else do you need

That was then but it's different now
You came along and I'm changed somehow
I wouldn't leave even if you wanted me to
And that's all over yeah that's old news
Gonna prove it to you if it's the last thing I do
That was then
Oh but this is you

And don't we all have some history
That we'd all like to forget

That was then but it's different now
You came along and I'm changed somehow
I wouldn't leave even if you wanted me to
And that's all over yeah that's old news
Gonna prove it to you if it's the last thing I do
That was then
Oh but this is you
