Step back 'cause the bass is fuzzin' 
Bloodhound gang bangs more than The Dirty Dozen 
Alley Oop here comes the slam I know where I stand 
I'm feelin' like Anthrax 'cause you know I'm The Man 
Yeah I dug your dame but all I did was kiss her 
But I got to second base with your mom and your sister 
I'll wipe the grin off your face like I was a can of Windex 
I threw a right I threw a right was it live or Memorex? 
Go down down deep deep in and out quick 
'Cause I'm harder than Chinese arithmetic 
Now my fist is in your face 'cause you stood in my way 
You tried to talk your shit and your ass got paid 
I get stupid like the mongoloid Corky 
Welcome to McDonald's may I take your order? 
'Cause I'm cold kickin' lyrics like my arm was on fire 
Like Pinnochio my nose don't grow 'cause I ain't no liar 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Clap it on clap it off sniff my exhaust 
'Cause I got more steps than Baryshnikov 
Like a pirouette a pirouette a pair of wet jeans 
You don't understand but your girl knows what I mean 
So I kicks my rhymes kind of complex 
A text of intricate words and other spoken effects 
Like a preacher on the mount teachin' things he doesn't follow 
When you tried to hit the brake but pushed on the throttle 
Mr. Goody Two Shoes picture the scenario 
Your girl blew me as I blew your stereo 
And I got more bass than a baseball diamond 
Don't put me on your chalkboard 'cause I'm not down with Simon 
Sonic boom in your room assume you're not there 
Booty lickin' nugget pickin' with your dad downstairs 
Love is just a fallacy I gots more force than gravity 
I can run all night like an Energizer battery 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all 

Go down go down to get it up get it up 
Go down go down to get it up y'all
