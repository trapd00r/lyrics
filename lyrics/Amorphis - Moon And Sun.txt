Where has the sun gone from us
Where is the moon lost to us
The moon will not gleam at all
Nor will the sun shine at all

Death opens its mouth
The son of the Northlander
Camo to look, to listen

"There beyond the river is hero walking"

He took one step and took another
To the north's shore he hurried
He drew his sword, wrenched the iron
Snatched from the sheath the harsh one
Upon whose point the moon shone
Upon whose hilt the sun flashed
Upon whose back a horse stands
He uttered a word, spoke thus,
"There the sun has gone from you
The sun gone and the moon lost"
