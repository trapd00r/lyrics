Tell the world right 

Got to get together. Now let's say forever an ever 
I've heard it all before 
What if I define a way to make you mine 
I can't take this no more 
Kiss me, bliss me, tell me that you miss me 
Don't care what you say 
But I changed my life and I will do it today 

Gonna tell the world I'm doing all right (without you baby) 
Gonna tell the world I'm feeling so fine, oh yeah (2X) 

Anywhere you go, I go just to be near you 
I don't want you around 
Let me tease ya, squeeze ya, and let me please ya 
Stay on solid ground 
Let me move ya, rock the micropnone to prove ya 
Don't care what you say 
But I changed my life and I will do it today 

Gonna tell the world I'm doing all right 
Without you baby 
Gonna tell the world I'm feeling so fine, oh yeah (2X) 

I'm doing all right, I'm doing all right 
Stronger now without you 
I'm doing all right, I'm doing all right 
Can't you let it go (2X) 

It's been a long time, I should have left you 
Before you could leave me I should have kept you (2X) 
Sitting by the phone, waiting for the girl to ring 
Just let me know, she's gonna cut the whole thing
