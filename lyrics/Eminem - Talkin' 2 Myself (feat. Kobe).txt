Hey yo
Before I start this song, man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
Snd bearing with me over these last couple of years
Ehile I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy
Woah, woah, woah, woah

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne

It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then could have got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic

Thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill tryin' to talk myself into it

Are you stupid, you gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punch line even
You're lyin' to yourself, your slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health
Is declining with your self-esteem, your crying out for help

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathin' and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echos in this hall though (oh-oh-whoa)

But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado

But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the break, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's

But instead of feelin' sorry for yourself, do somethin' bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby
Quit worryin' about what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that im not the only one

So I picked myself off the ground and fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard, I bounced twice, suffice this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushin' em out

I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally

Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin' up, oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over, homos

I'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep your head up
T.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' em, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So there it is, damn
It feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Hey yo, and to anybody that I thought about going at
It was never nothin' personal; it was jus' some shit I was going through
And to everybody else... I'm back, heh
