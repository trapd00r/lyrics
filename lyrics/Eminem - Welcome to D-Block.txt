[Chorus - Eminem]
Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams
With things aint always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers,
Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun dont shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Cuz every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood
Take a good look around you cuz there's a D Block near you

[Jadakiss]
Place where aint no body that proud, its a fuckin black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Workin around though, see if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
Five minutes flat the whole town though
Lot is assumin a *****s salary
More lies than truth definatly more rumors than reality
Only way you beatin a body is a technicality
Other than that catch em and clinton on a gallery
The determination and dedication of disipline
Listenin and catchin the ***els you was missin
And they still doin coward shit
You know the haters gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Somethin in the air but the older they get,
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick,
We dont play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say I'm exquisite,
Anytime you can pay us a visit

[Chorus - Eminem]
Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams
With things aint always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers,
Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun dont shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Cuz every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood
Take a good look around you cuz there's a D Block near you

[Eminem]
Welcome to D Block, the might mighty D Block
A place in New York City where Diddy wont even walk
Its D Block, the part of Yonkers where I wouldnt be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D Block dont even stop to talk, you just keep walkin,
Stick up kids every block who walks with that free op-
-Portunity, as soon as you leave out that ***elry shop
And you wont even notice your mind will be so preo-
-Ccupied on that new watch you just copped
You wont even see that ride pull up along side you
You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks
D Block the place where gees get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You dont even see cops, hiphop police dont even stop,
On D Block, where everybody wants to be Pac
And you can get popped over the new G Unit reboks

[Chorus - Eminem]
Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams
With things aint always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers,
Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun dont shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Cuz every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood
Take a good look around you cuz there's a D Block near you

[Sheek Louch]
If you bust and your gun got *****z on the run
And you rep where you from ***** you D Block
And you try to come home and your pockets is light as a cup
They dont give a fuck, you D Block
Aiyo bang bang *****z, let's get it on
Homies been a monster, but its worst now that my son been born
And every ***** where I be, I put in work for free,
It's D Block mothafucka, here grab this P

[Styles P]
Welcome to D Block, a place where lil *****z is killaz,
And the mother's raisin a son That turns into Gorillaz,
And the hallways is pissy as hell, all we do is get bigger
More ignorant, you send us to jail, my *****z shoot anything that'll move
Sell drugs, from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon,
I'd die the way I stand With my man if I can when the shells come,
This is D Block ya'll welcome

[Chorus - Eminem]
Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams
With things aint always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers,
Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun dont shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Cuz every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood
Take a good look around you cuz there's a D Block near you
