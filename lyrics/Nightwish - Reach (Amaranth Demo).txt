Baptised with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself

War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone

You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give

Reach
For hand-held heart through life
For the dancer to arrive
Reach
And catch me before I fall

Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time we reach
For the ones, whoever dare

You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give

Reach
For hand-held heart through life

For the dancer to arrive
Reach
And catch me before I fall

Reach
For a friend whoever cares
For someone whoever dares
Reach
To catch me when I fall

Reaching for the doubting one by heart
Hearing voices calling
Catch the one who's falling

Reach
For hand-held heart through life
For the dancer to arrive
Reach
And catch me before I fall

Reach
For a friend whoever cares
For someone whoever dares
Reach
To catch me when I fall
