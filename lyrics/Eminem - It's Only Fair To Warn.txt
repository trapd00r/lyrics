It's like that Eminem, Eminem all right bust it
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward dropping an acapela
To chop a fella to mozerella
Worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumpin you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of slugs
So were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with their asses ripped out of their pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Dr. Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpal in through the top of your scalp
And pullin your adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment
