What you gonna tell your dad, it's like a wheel of fortune
And what you gonna tell your dad if this wheel let's you down?

My love is my engine and you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
I'm in love with another fool

Don't push me, I don't want to can't you see it?
Hasten slowly
And don't count your chicks before they're hatched, baby

What you gonna tell your dad, it's like a wheel of fortune
And what you gonna tell your dad if this wheel let's you down?
My love is my engine and you might be fuel

Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool

Hey, you
We're gonna make you move
It tastes like steel
Like a stab from a knife

Ooh, what you gonna tell your daddy?
What you gonna tell your daddy?

Say, what you gonna tell your daddy?
Mmm, oh, what you gonna tell your daddy?
Ooh, what you gonna tell your daddy?
I'm in love with another fool!

I'm in love with you, I like your style
I want you, I'm in love
I'm in love with you, I like your style
I want you, I'm in love

What you gonna tell your dad, it's like a wheel of fortune
And what you gonna tell your dad if this wheel let's you down, yeaheah
What you gonna tell your dad, it's like a wheel of fortune
And what you gonna tell your dad if this wheel let's you down?

My love is my engine and you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool
I'm in love with another fool!

Yeaheaheaheah
I'm in love with another fool!
Dad, dad, dad, daddy

I'm in love with you, I like your style
I want you, I'm in love
I'm in love with you, I like your style
I want you, I'm in love
