So many things that you could say or do.
Don't wanna say goodbye.
So many nights that I would cry for you
But you were cold as ice.
Now I'm searching for
Someone I can be sure of.
Sacrifice the only one that I need.

No hideaway for the runaway.
Every creature of love has excited me.
Someone is breaking your heart (heart) (heart).
So tomorrow I'll tell you that I'm sorry
And it's too late to worry if
Someone is breaking your heart (heart) (heart).

Just an echo of a distant dream
That slowly disappears
In the magic of the ecstasy,
That show between the tears.
Before my eyes the crystal was broken
I swallowed every promise you made.

No hideaway for the runaway.
Every creature of love has excited me.
Someone is breaking your heart (heart) (heart).
So tomorrow I'll tell you that I'm sorry
And it's too late to worry if
Someone is breaking your heart (heart) (heart).

Moonlight is cruel as the light
And the future is only a lie.
Oh baby,
Birds of a feather will fly.
I'm alone in the night.

No hideaway for the runaway.
Every creature of love has excited me.
Someone is breaking your heart (heart) (heart).
So tomorrow I'll tell you that I'm sorry.
And it's too late to worry if
Someone is breaking your heart (heart) (heart).
