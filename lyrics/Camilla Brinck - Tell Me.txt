Hhhhhhhhh aaaaaaa, hey...

I'm gonna try to make you understand,
That there is something that you have to change,
You tell me I'm your world, your everything,
I love you but it can't go on like this
You have to except me for who I am,
And now you try to turn me into something else
You have to let it go 'cause it's not right...

Ref: Cause you don't have to tell me,
All the things I already know, babe,
Keep it to yourself,
Don't tell me, how to live my life no more.
You don't have to tell me,
What to say or what to do, babe,
Keep it to yourself, don't tell me,
How to live my life nomore,
I'll leave you baby, don't you know.

I want you by my side, but I can't hide,
What I feel inside, it make me cry,
You want me believe that I'm the one,
But baby, after all the things that you done,
You have to let it go,
'Cause it's not right...

Stick: I looked at myself but I like what I see,
So all the things that's on your mind,(keep it to yourself)
I want you in my life, but I want you to stop...
Tell me how to run my life.

Just keep it to yourself...

Chior: don't tell me, all the things I already know, babe,
Keep it to yourself, don't tell me,
How to live my life no more,
