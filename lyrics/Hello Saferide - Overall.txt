Overall, I think we did a good job, we did the 
best we could, I think we did the best we could. 
Overall, we couldn't have done much else, I 
think we pulled it off. I always thought we 
pulled it off, I always thought we pulled if off. 

Days and nights, we were a shoulder to cry on, 
weren't we? Weren't we? Smiling eyes that 
screamed “Confide in me!”. That was you and 
me, weren't we. Weren't we. 

It couldn't be our fault, we never said anything 
political. Sure you worked late some nights. 
I always thought you could have breast-fed him 
longer than you did but we let him in, not 
enough but I let him in.

I've got my calender here he was sick back in 92 
the week when they had history on World 
War II. You never should have got him that 
video game for Christmas. They shoot people in 
that game, pixled people without names. 

Overall, we've always done as they say we 
should have, haven't we? Haven't we? We always 
smiled, we hid all issues away, didn't we? Didn't 
we? 

You know the new receptionist at work - she's a 
Jew. She could visit - he could see she could be 
me or you. And bring the gay guy downstairs - 
he doesn't look gay at all. We broke something 
without knowing - but we did a good job overall, 
didn't we? 

We always smiled, we hid all troubles away 
didn't we, didn't we? What will the neighbours 
say, maybe that shaved hair will grown back. Or 
grandma will have a heart attack.
