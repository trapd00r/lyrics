The devil's driving my car tonight and he's drunk
He's pissed, he's mad
I don't care which of you
He fucks up

I've played with fire
And the matches they are burning still in my hand
They can try to shut me up
They never will
They never will again

With all the drugs
With all the drugs
With all the drugs in the world
You can't shut up that girl

There's no one in this bed
Obliterate the truth
'Cause there's no lies
That I could be and you would need

With all the drugs
With all the drugs
But there's all the drugs in the world
But there's all the drugs in the world
You can't shut up that girl

with all all of my money 
with all all of my love 
with all  all of my money 
It doesn't feel as good
as the drugs

with all the drugs in the world
you can't shut up that girl
with all the drugs in the world
with all the drugs in the world

Gonna burn out every inch of you
Oh baby I'll burn you till the lights all die
You'll never ever ever fuck like me
So baby why why do you even try

Generation it has slipped away
Oh baby leave no trace of it behind
Steal the power of the powerful men
And baby leave here with me leave here tonight
