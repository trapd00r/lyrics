Listen now
I am afraid of everything
When you told me I was special
It was the happiest moment for a long long time

Listen now
I keep forgetting your name
When you laid down on the kitchen floor
It was the happiest moment for a long long time

We seek new seed now
Some revolutionary
and you will never get a hold
We seek and we will find
reason to stay alive
The price has never been this low

Listen now
I was afraid of everything
Then I straightened my head up
It was the happiest moment for a long long time

We seek new seed now
Some revolutionary
and you will never get a hold
We seek and we will find
reason to stay alive
The price has never been this low
