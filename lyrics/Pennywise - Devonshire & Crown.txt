"Devonshire And Crown"
I picture your face everyday of my life
But lately it's honesty that keeps me around

A pint of their best and a seat with a view
This corner looks all too familiar
I just wanna tell you I love you, I'm safe
On Devonshire and Crown

I picture your face everyday of my life
But lately it's honesty that keeps me around

A pint of their best and a seat with a view
This corner looks all too familiar
I just wanna tell you I love you, I'm safe
On Devonshire and Crown

Who knows which letter just might be the last
This song will be done by the end of this glass
Hey brown eyes, I hope you are sleeping and dreaming of clouds

Here comes another three-dollar cliché
I nod to the barman and he does the same
And again and again and again and again, again I am down
But so prown

It's summer where you are, it's winter down here
You're sleeping, I'm already boozing
All the cool kids are speaking their minds
But I cannot hear

'Cause people are sounding like white noise these days
They fancy themselves as a critic
But I think of you and it takes me away to a perfect place

Who knows which letter just might be the last
This song will be done by the end of this glass
Hey blue eyes, I hope you are sleeping and dreaming of clouds

Here comes another three-dollar cliché
I nod to the barman and he does the same
Again and again and again and again I am down
But so prown

Who knows which letter just might be the last
This song will be done by the end of this glass
Hey blue eyes, I hope you are sleeping and dreaming of clouds

Here comes another three-dollar cliché
I nod to the barman and he does the same
Again and again and again and again I am down
But so prown

I am down
But so prown

On Devonshire and Crown
On Devonshire and Crown
On Devonshire and Crown
