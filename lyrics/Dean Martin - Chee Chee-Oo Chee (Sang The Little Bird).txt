(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Once on a tree top tall a little bird
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Sang out the sweetest song I ever heard

(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(He sang to me so merrily)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(The little birdie on the tree)

Life's such a lovely thing it seemed to say
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
If you'd only sing your cares away
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Chee chee-ooh chee so merrily it went along
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Chee chee-ooh chee so happily his little song
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
And so (and so) I sing (I sing)
Chee chee-ooh chee the happy happy little thing

If you (if you) feel blue (feel blue)
Sing chee chee-ooh chee and you can be as happy too
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Sing this happy little song
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Chee chee-ooh chee
Chee chee-ooh chee it sang to me so merrily
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Chee chee-ooh chee the little birdie on the tree
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(If you feel blue)
Sing chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee and you can be as happy too
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
(Chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee)
Sing this happy little song
(Sing chee chee-ooh chee, chee chee-ooh chee and you can be as happy as can be)
