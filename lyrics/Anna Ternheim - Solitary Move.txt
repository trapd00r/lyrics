Lovely night
I'll dance to tonight
Safe as long as I'm moving
No one touches me now
Hands without skin, oh so soothing
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Lovely night
Free myself from heavy guilt on my shoulders
Stillness in the cold
Peace comes crawling up my bone

In a solitary move
I am moving away from you
I am moving away from you

Lovely night no need, but one
Let go what I hold in my hands
Let go what I hold in my heart
My head
My chest
Ocean helps man to forget

In a solitary move
I am moving away from you
In a solitary move
I am moving away from you
I am moving away from you
