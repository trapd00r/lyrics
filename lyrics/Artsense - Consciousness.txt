(Verse 1):

Too much to think about
Too easy not to think about
But the pain make you bring it out
Maybe this something i should drink about
Thinking if the game and the fame gon bring a lil change
Now i'm just contemplating liquor
But you know it start get ya
When ya mind start to flicker
Like maybe this something i should really fuck think about
A penny for my thoughts
Turned to nickels for my lines
And rapping all these lines
Started gettin me the dimes
Now i'm feelin like man i'm exactly what the game need
Quarters turned into my dollar for a dream
But then you spending checks when you really should be saving
Man fuck a freestyle when you write it like Langston
But you got the five heartbeats
Then the temptations
And ya conscience start the whispers
And you really can't take it
I'm just sayin

(Chorus):

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two

(Verse 2):

Then you try to flip a dollar
Just to get something new
Now you touchin bases
Turnin one into two
Like baseball
One day its gon pay off
Plus you know 3's coming soon
But then you start to panic
But you can't get flustered
Cuz its a cold war
So you know they start rush ya
But you a rare kind and they'll never be another
Plus its a cold world
Be sure to bring a cover
Cuz the 4 in sight
Turn to 5 by night
Man a 6 would be fine
But you want 7-8-9
But then you hit 10
Think you never win again
Then you pray to god and you see its all meant
So you finally see that you can't be stopped
Told you shoot for the moon so you aim for the top
So you finally see exactly why you got the rock
4th quarter down 2 and then you take the shot

(Chorus):

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two

ThaNuRelijun:

Dear God
I think i found a new religion
And its based on the true condition that was truly missing
I was thinking of my brother who think they found you in prison
And my other brothers that drown in the new prescription
Cuz they been praying every night
But they feel like you don't listen
I became the smartest
When i took my art sense
Mixed it with my darkness
And became a true artist
So now i'm putting portraits
On vinyls or murals with a title
These illustrations i'm painting
Are truer than the bible
I mean no disrespct but this is the new religion
Like expressionizm
If you close ya eyes and envision a television
But without a picture
Just scriptures that come to life
Or headless sculptures that walk around at night
All i need is one mic
Shit now i might need 3
Promise before i die to get the revolution
On TV or maybe in 3D
You think that they'll see it then
I mean just picture me rollin
The blackGOD lacing my rap ties
And after i die just play this and close ya eyes
If you ever wanna see me again
I mean im like Edgar Allan but with better styling
This my tell tale heart but with 11 volumes
Sculptures and portraits portrayed
From photo albums stuck in my memory
I just hope they remember me through infinity
