Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big? Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch, you move again I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay)

Don't make me wake this baby, she don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you?
Too bad bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine"
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed, look it Kim
Look at your husband now (No), I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?
(Why are you doing this?) Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk, you're never gonna get away with this)
You think I give a fuck? Come on we're going for a ride bitch (No)
Sit up front (We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up)
We'll be right back, well I will, you'll be in the trunk

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you

You really fucked me Kim, you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen, that was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean, that's fucked up
(I love you) Oh God, my brain is racing
(I love you) What are you doing? Change the station
I hate this song, does this look like a big joke? (No)
There's a four year-old little boy laying dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha, what, you think I'm kidding you?
You loved him didn't you? (No)
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole, yeah, bite me
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that) No, you think I'm ugly (Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you, I hate you, I swear to God, I hate you, oh my God, I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me? (I'm sorry)
How the fuck could you do this to me?

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you

Come on get out (I can't, I'm scared)
I said get out bitch (Let go of my hair)
(Please don't do this baby, please I love you)
(Look, we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you! You did this to us, you did it, it's your fault
Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut (Oh my God)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should've known better when you started to act weird
We could of - hey, where you going? Get back here
You can't run from me Kim, it's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha ha, got ya, go ahead, yell
Here I'll scream with you, "Ah, somebody help!"
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed bitch, bleed!
bleed bitch, bleed!
Bleed!

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
