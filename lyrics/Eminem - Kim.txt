(Eminem) 
Aww look at Daddy's baby girl 
That's daddy's baby 
Little sleepy head 
Yesterday I changed your diaper 
Wiped you and powdered you. 
How did you get so big? 
Can't believe it, now you're two 
Baby you're so precious 
Daddy's so proud of you 
SIT DOWN BITCH!
YOU MOVE AGAIN I'LL BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU! 

Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm about to do 
Quit cryin' bitch! Why you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue? 
Oh, what's the matter Kim? 
Am I too loud for you? 
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first, I'm like: "All right, You wanna throw me out? That's fine!"
But not for him to take my place! Are you out of your mind? 
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine! 
How could you let him sleep in our bed? 
Look at Kim!
Look at your husband now!
I said, look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he? 
Little Punk! 
Kim: Why are you doing this?
Eminem: Shut the fuck up!
Kim: You're drunk! You're never going to get away with this!
Eminem: You think I give a fuck?! 
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! 
Kim: No! 
Eminem: Sit up front!
Kim: Well, I can't just leave Hailie alone! What if she wakes up? 
Eminem: We'll be right back... Well, I will --- you'll be in the trunk 

Chorus 2x:
So long
Bitch, you did me so wrong 
I don't wan't to go on 
Living in this world without you 

You really fucked me Kim! You really did a number on me!
I never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me 
But we was kids then Kim, I was only 18!
That was years ago!
I thought we wiped the slate clean!
That's fucked up! 
Kim: I love you!
Eminem: Oh God, my brain is racing 
Kim: I love you!
Eminem: What are you doing?
Change the station! I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?
Kim: No!
Eminem: There's a four year old little boy layin' dead with a slit throat
In your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kidding you?
You loved him didn't you? 
Kim: No!
Eminem: Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me? 
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim, KIM! 
Why don't you like me? 
You think I'm ugly, don't you? 
Kim: It's not that! 
Eminem: No, you think I'm ugly 
Kim: Baby
Eminem: Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me! 
I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! 
I SWEAR TO GOD I HATE YOU!
OH MY GOD, I LOVE YOU!
How the fuck could you do this to me?! 
Kim: Sorry! 
Eminem: How the fuck could you do this to me?! 

Chorus 2x 

Eminem: Come on, get out 
Kim: I can't! I'm scared!
Eminem: I said get out, bitch! 
Kim: Let go of my hair!
Please don't do this, baby! 
Please I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!
Eminem: Fuck you! You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
Oh my God, I'm cracking up. Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party 
And you were, like, so drunk you threw up all over Archie? 
That was funny, wasn't it? 
Kim: Yes 
Eminem: That was funny, wasn't it?! 
Kim: Yes!
Eminem: See it all makes sense, doesn't it? 
You and your husband have a fight,
One of you tries to grab a knife,
And during the struggle, he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced!
Kim: No!
Eminem: And while this is going on, his son has woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut!
Kim: Oh my God! 
Eminem: So now, they both dead, and you slash your own throat,
So now it's double homicide AND suicide with no note!
I should have known better when you started to act weird 
We could've----HEY! Where you going? Get back here! 
You can't run from me, Kim!
It's just us, nobody else! 
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha! Ha! Got'cha! 
Kim: Ahh! 
Eminem: Go ahead! Yell! 
Here I'll scream with you! 
"AHH, SOMEBODY HELP!" 
Don't you get it bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you! 
You were supposed to love me!
(*Kim choking*) 
NOW BLEED, BITCH! BLEEED! 
BLEED, BITCH! BLEEED! BLEEEEED!
