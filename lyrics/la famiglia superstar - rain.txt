TRANSLATION : 
It all began in Hawaii A.RA.SHI 
A.RA.SHI for dream 
Clasping hands alternately with everyone, 
while keeping up each day's arduous schedules 
Lacking the ability, and cannot find one's self, holding in unease the entire day 
Still, even if the road ahead is undefined, 
Run towards the present with all your strength 

Found a reason to be strong, 
You are the one always in my heart, my friend 
Every time you call my name, I'll be there 
No matter how far, we are friends 

Understanding myself, and vaguely knowing what kind of place I'm at 
During the times when I couldn't trust in anyone, during the times when I couldn't see my surroundings clearly, 
there have been instances where I've wasted a lot of time, 
and instances where I understand clearly 
yet still cannot do it 
Taking each step with my own feet, surpassing the barriers, that is the present 
"These past five years, I've never been alone." Experiencing this everyday, 
I walked through five years. 
Undertaking the pain together, sharing the laughter together 
Passing each day with happiness, at the same time thankful of those around me 
My own road was chosen by my own self 
My mind is steady and firm 
(echo: my mind is steady and firm) 
*

What would it be like after five years? 
Would each day still pass with happiness? 
Compared to the present, would I be more trusting in myself and others? 
Waiting here with a smile, 
waiting for the future of the next five years 
If possible, the wishes written down in my letter 
I want to convey it all 
The new road that I've started creating from here, 
I want to convey this long road to everyone. 
One person running, aiming for the topline, with a juxtaposing lane by the side 
At that time, who will be by my side? 
Without a doubt it will be the five of us together Within the encircled surroundings, like it is now 
With you at my side, with everyone at my side

At that time, who will be by my side? 
Without a doubt it will be the five of us together Within the encircled surroundings, like it is now 
With you at my side, with everyone at my side 
At that time, who will be by my side? 
Without a doubt it will be the five of us together Within the encircled surroundings, with you at my side This is what I hope for, I make this wish here now
