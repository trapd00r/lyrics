We sat by the fire
United in song
Under the moonlight
All night long

We sang 'Halleluyah'
For the joy of it all

And out on the water
A caroling moon
Sings just a sweet
Heavenly tune

There's peace in Gods forest
The temple of life

Halleluyah
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Halleluyah

And back in the city
I'm losing control
I need a place
To ease my soul

There's peace in God's temple
The temple of life

Halleluyah
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Halleluyah

Halleluyah
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Halleluyah

Halleluyah
Halleluyah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Halleluyah

Thank you Jesus
We praise your name
Thank you lord
Halleluyah
