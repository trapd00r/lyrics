Chorus:
One little riddle
Two little, three little
Four little riddle
Five little, six little
Seven little riddle
Eight little riddle 
Now you know
You gotta go

Repeat Chorus

Monday morning was the first time
That I noticed something strange
Going on with you your kiss was not the same
Was it all just in my mind?
Or was it something I should pay attention to?
Then on Tuesday, having lunch with friends
I thought I saw your car
Leaving from our favorite restaurant but too far
For my eyes to see what I feel
Would be heartbreaking if what I saw was true

Chorus 2x

Wednesday evening
Every time the phone would ring
You'd say hello
But when I'd come around you'd say I got to go
You're friends never called line two before
And I don't know nobody named Tyra
Oh now it's Thursday
You left the house to go to work an hour early
You said you had some papers for your boss to sign
But you left your briefcase home
And when I called your job
They said you were not there

Chorus 2x

Friday night
Is the night we've always had our weekend date
But you showed up at the house extremely late
Without any conversation you just went to bed
And said that your head ached
Now it's the weekend
And you know that it's the day I do my cleaning
And when I washed your shirts I just could not believe
I'm picking hair weave off your sleeve
Found a letter in your pocket from Louise, please

Chorus 4x
