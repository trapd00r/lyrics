Come and behold him
Born the King of Angels

Sing in exaltation,
Sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above;
Glory to God
Glory In the highest:
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him

Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to thee be glory given;
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing:
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of Angels
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord.
