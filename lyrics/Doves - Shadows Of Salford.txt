In shadows of Salford 
You will walk again 
The shadows of lovers 
All will be quiet then 

The roads that your mothers 
They would follow down 
In shadows of Salford 
Let me walk again 

The love that you left there 
Spoke without a sound 
A love was so haunting 
Lost and never found 

The roads that your mother 
They would follow down 
For in shadows of Salford 
You will walk again
