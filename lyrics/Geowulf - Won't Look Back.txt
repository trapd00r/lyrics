Time on my own, I am still loved
Captive like a teenage secret crush
Now time alone's my living hell
Claimed it as if it was yours to own

Oh, I run the fight
This time, I'm too tight
You're the horse before the cart
To find my broken heart
Finally found your bottom line
You've always changed your mind
Found some peace in your parade
Can't you let me walk away?
I won't look back

My restless sleep was once my own
Somehow you've been cast a major role
Can't help the tears, they've come at dawn
This time they won't stop me from movin' on

Oh, I run the fight
This time, I'm too tight
You're the horse before the cart
To find my broken heart
Finally found your bottom line
You've always changed your mind
Found some peace in your parade
Can't you let me walk away?
I won't look back
I won't look back

Now let's realize I won't look back
Now let's realize I won't look back
Now let's realize I won't look back
Now let's realize I won't look back
I won't look back
