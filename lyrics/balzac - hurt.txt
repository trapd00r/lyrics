I wonder what day it was?
The memories will rust away
Beautiful days will carry on

I wonder what days it was?
The pale light shines on through
It keeps watch over me
The Beautiful light will sustain

Feelings are disclosed
No reason to take the fiend's hand
Feelings are disclosed

Don't hurt me

The murder
Don't hurt me
Don't cause me pain
Erase it from my last memory

My mother
You're not here
Not here anymore, still I must apologize
You're not here
