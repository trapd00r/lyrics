Damn right I'm a maniac !

Damn right !

Maniac maniac maniac maniac....

Damn right I’m a maniac
You'd better watch your back
'Cause I’m fucking up your program
Fuckin' up your program
Damn right I'm a maniac
Maniac maniac maniac maniac
Damn right I'm a maniac
You'd better watch your back
'Cause I'm fucking up your program

And if you're stuck up
You just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker !
It’s just one of those days !

Feeling like a freight train
Leaves with a blood stain
Fucking up your program

And if you’re stuck up
You just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker !
It's just one of those days !

You don’t really know why
What you wanna justify
Ripping someone's head off
I think you'd better quit talking that shit, punk !
So come and get it

I feel like shit
My suggestion is to keep your distance
Now I'm dangerous
Right now I’m dangerous
Right now I'm dangerous
And if my day keeps going this way I just might
Break your fucking face tonight !

Give me something to break
Give me something to break
And if you're stuck up
You just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker !
It's just one of those days!

It's just one of those days !
It's just one of those days !
It's just one of those days !

Feeling like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a blood stain
So come an get it !
