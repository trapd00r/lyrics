You took a piece of my heart
I never thought that this could fall apart
You said you fell in love
And this was more than I had ever been afraid of
Another life
Another happy ending, it cuts like a knife
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine

You've got me deeper than deep and I'm constantly blinded
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls are divided
Why can't they forgive me, these demons inside
Deeper than deep and I'm constantly blinded
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, 'cause our souls are divided
How can it be that you're ready for love?

Ready for love ...

How can it be that you're ready for love ...

Time will tell
A single day could help me break this spell
Don't want to be alone
When will I be understood, when is my kingdom to come?
Another boy, another life
Another happy ending, and I'll be alive
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine

You've got me deeper than deep and I'm constantly blinded
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls are divided
Why can't they forgive me, these demons inside
Deeper than deep and I'm constantly blinded
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, 'cause our souls are divided
How can it be that you're ready for love?

How can it be that you're ready for love ...

How can it be that you're ready for love ...
