Cane standing in the fields getting old and red
Lot of misery in Georgetown, three men lying dead
And Joshua, head of the government, say strike for better pay
Cane cutters are striking, Joshua gone away
Joshua gone Barbados, just like he don't know
People on this Island, they got nowhere to go

(??) In the city, you can hear how the women bawl
Joshua gone Barbados, he don't care at all

Sonny Child the overseer, I swear he's an ignorant man
Walking through the canefield, pistol in his hand
Sugar mill owner told the strikers, I don't need you to cut my cane
Bring in another bunch of fellows, strike be all in vain
Joshua gone Barbados, just like he don't know
People on the St. Vincent, they got no place to go.
