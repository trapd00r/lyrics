ACT TWO

Scene 1
"Dances and Marches"

 RINGMASTER
Versailles the leaves fall
It's that time of the year
Her Majesty is bored with all
This endless calling for reform
But the sound of young men marching
Is like music to her ear

The sound of young men marching
Is like music to her ear
But she dreams of young men dancing

QUEEN
Dancing, dancing...

RINGMASTER
And the dream of young men dancing
Hangs like birdsong in the air
