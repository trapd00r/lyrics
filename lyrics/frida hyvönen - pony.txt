A stable's where you learn to be in charge and not take shit
Dress to the occasion
Leather boots and a stiff black whip
I don't even have to use it
I just hold it like this

Pony knows when she sees it
That does she not behave she'll get to taste it
Pony knows when she sees it
That does she not obey she'll make me use it

I tighten the girdle and I shorten the reins
She supplies raw power
I direct it with my skills

Right into the wild we go
It's a dark green ?
Pony's warming from her light brown body
Rises a smell of sweat

Tickle the palm of my hand with grey eager lips
I give you sugar pony if you give me obedience
Tickle the palm of my hand with grey eager lips
I give you sugar pony if you give me this

Slowly the earth turns
And horses come and go
My pony's shrinking
I never stop to grow

God I miss the horses
The way they used to look at me
Oh God I miss the horses
The way they used to make me feel
