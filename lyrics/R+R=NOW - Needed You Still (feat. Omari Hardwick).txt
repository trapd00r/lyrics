Yo I like this
Just let it go Preem
Give em a second to give us a lil courtesy, you know
You ready? (You ready?) Okay
Well hold these sunflower seeds, I'm going in

Guess who's bizack, the best 2 that's gon' ever do it
Don't need no metro or Neptune's trizack
This is what you call alcoholic recordin', flawless guitar rifts
Now they ridin' with us for sure in the Audi or this
Ferrari, this is for Joe Montgomery and Johnny Morris
Now we 'bout to power up the Ghost like Omari Hardwick
Time flies when you havin' a nice time, so when I drive I try to ride slower than Heinz pourin'
My mama told me to try to enjoy it, take you a vitamin boy and stick to your diet and tore it
Keep risin' and soarin', don't put your mind on the evil
Keep your eye on the people who would kill just to be by you
And beware of those who appear to be dyin' to meet you
Let your therapy be The Bible and let yourself just be legendary
And just continue to keep on helpin' the less fortunate
Not for no fuckin' credit in public but for the blessings above
Most important lesson I learned was just to love (true)
Most of my aggression was extra liquor and just the drugs (true)
Wherever I go, whoever I'm with, I'm met with hugs (true)
While all you rappers gettin' extorted, in debt with thugs
I'm

Ridin' around in a Maserati 'bout to go to McDonald's eatin' sunflower seeds (laidback)
But still I spit the shell out the window
Still I spit the shell out the window
Now that I'm livin' well all I remember is all I could afford was sunflower seeds (laidback)
But still I spit the shell out the window
Still I spit the shell out the window

I will spit these out a Gallardo, then peel off laughin' like Ricky Ricardo
Go to your lady home and spit a whole bag of sunflower seeds out on her marble
Floor, oh no I didn't
I kill the fish and put wings on the dog for you treatin' me like I don't, don't know fly bitches
Nickel, I'm back in the prime of things
2 jackas this one is tabular, that one is Steve McQueen
I flip on a rapper quick as Christopher could finish up a trap on a beat machine
I pull out a full metal jacket, show you exactly what goin' platinum with features mean
I am the absolute shit I actually speak latrine, PRhyme 2
All day you hear UZI, choppers and nines too
All day you niggas eat sushi, sausage and fondue
The drum dilla like Ma Duke, the Hummer red and it come atop giant sized shoes like clown suits
The rifle rightfully mine too, it might just heat up from the field in the clutch like when Mike and LeBron shoot

Ridin' around in a Maserati 'bout to go to McDonald's eatin' sunflower seeds (laidback)
But still I spit the shell out the window
But still I spit the shell out the window
Now that I'm livin' well all I remember is all I could afford was sunflower seeds (laidback)
But still I spit the shell out the window
Still I spit the shell out the window

And I, I grew up in the streets
One man (one man), one heart (one heart), one love (one love)
Livin' in the ghetto you get one chance (you get one chance)
You know I keep a piece and my sunflower seeds in the other hand
And Po-Po out here shootin' niggas, yeah they tryna kill the brother man
And I, I grew up in the streets
One man (one man), one heart (one heart), one love (one love)
Livin' in the ghetto you get one chance (you get one chance)
You know I keep a piece and my sunflower seeds in the other hand
