Tonight I'll drown
In the eye of my lover
If I empty my hands
I'll hold everything

I've given up my will
Now you can take it all from me
Or you can leave me
Drowing in a wave of my conceit

Tonight I'll crash
On the ground of my lover
If I give up my soul
I'll be everything

I've climbed the highest hills
And traveled all the distant seas
But that just leaves me
Broken on the ground of my conceit

There's a secret so deep
Opened up from a day
When there's nothing to keep
And there's nothing to let fall away

Tonight I'll burn 
In the flame of my lover
If I give you my heart
I'll be everything

I died for all the thrills
But always wound up on my knees
That's where you'll see me
Burning in the fire of my conceit.
