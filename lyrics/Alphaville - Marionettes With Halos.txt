Imperial goliath - lost in unhelpful space
And You-Know-Who's creating islands - of increasing entropy
Mesmerised circus monkeys - dissolve like Quaaludes in lemonade
Industrial moguls trot out their sermons
They're all - they're begging for a new sound

Marionettes with halos sell out their rights,.. oooh, crack, baby, crack
Marionettes with halos, immortalized, doomed variety acts
Marionettes with halos sell out their rights, crack, baby, crack

You're so full of lies - pimped in x-factor make-up
Applause over end credits as the ghouls leave the theatre
You maybe very sexy but you're not an artist at all
Karaoke pipe dreams of rock n roll eunochs
Proclaiming Dick Rowe for their hero

Marionettes with halos sell out their rights,.. oooh, crack, baby, crack
Marionettes with halos, immortalized, doomed variety acts
Marionettes with halos sell out their rights,.. oooh, crack, baby, crack

Marionettes with halos sell out their rights,.. oooh, crack, baby, crack
Marionettes with halos, immortalized, doomed variety acts
Marionettes with halos sell out their rights,.. oooh, crack, baby, crack
Marionettes with halos sell out their rights
Marionettes with halos
Crack, baby, crack
Crack, baby, crack
Crack, baby, crack

Oooh, crack, baby, crack
