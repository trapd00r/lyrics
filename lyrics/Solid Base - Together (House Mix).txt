Yeah, ayy, ayy

30,000 words in a rap that's a first and in fact
That's the most in the world on a track
Yeah I've been searching a map
For like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast
And I'm the only one out here and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat it gets turned into ash
If I play you a beat it gets turned into trash
Ayy hold up wait
When I'm on the track I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty thousand hours
Fuck thirty thousand words I don't slow my breaks
I go UK then I make so many pounds
Everybody think I'm overweight
Getting bread, see me eating
But I gotta go in better hold my plate
Oh, oh, gotta switch up I'm so godly
I'm the bishop now these haters
Wanna link up my bars make them get the hiccups so I
Had to run it up real quick freestyle
Gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big
Cuz I gotta get a credit dear this real lit real shit
Nowadays they write me another write it back
See my future demons like it's a psychopath
Like you're gonna suck man
So I'm driving down the road and I mighty crash
Through the dash always moving to know where to find ya
Hey moving on gotta find a team
Or no my stripes like a middle but I'm blind means
All these drivers about to get fucked
Laid there by the readout
We keep so required I am assigned seats
Pioneer to the shit Leif Eriksson
I was even hunted 2012 lame jail
In these places got me Season D declared
To Nutella fall off next year imma be airing it
Yeah I'm running a little shit running ducky
In another coming down for a hundred bucks
And I start all I wanted was like big dozen hits couple
And a couple zeros for the shit's why not
Look what I got look what I bought cameras
My true eye on the side cause
Issues they go too high only high tops
Fuck yeah I'm the new guy with a my on
And company Smith I'm a motherfucking icon
Boy too I'm too cold I don't even on my ice on
Too late I don't even have the mic on
It up to break out and even the lights on
Better way it's too easy like a layup
And my fists - entertainers see - no you got to stay up
Taking bets on that I'll fail
It's time to pay up now you're trying to hide your face
I'm pretty sure that they make a
I'll drop a head to get a world record
She's your favorite artist cuz I'm sure better
Well maybe not but I tried though
Post Malone I go psycho
Leave you a stink like a rhino
Cuz I rat be no gyro
And I ride fast and our prime slowed
Two miles in the W's tight boat
Hop into the track
Give you the lovin' you give it right back
Ten different flows I'd be spitting some tripe
And some other shit get in its get on a man
Who done this for like a year
Number Brite is clear
How they can I respect as that I'm here
And I'm here to stay did you hear me say
I'm not here to play
He got a flow on a voice now
I remember when he choking a boy out
But he's back in show no choice now
Don't you know that he's gonna destroy now
So I'm gonna get there and I know how
To cut his beat I'll be blaring so loud
We'll be talking about bitches and money
This shit is so funny my parents are so proud, damn
I'm starting to try trying the shots
At it look at the grind and see stars on the sky
Drawing the line all the you right
Beside is here I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high
If you think that you've compared to me it must be part of the lines
Copying guys
You better send all those B through the future like Marty McFly
30,000 words on a try little bitch
Now these people tell my bit on every yak little bitch
Nobody gotta cut it got a stats little bitch
You giving me a headache where the advil bitch
But I'm doing all the can and I did it in the past
Tense making all this money up for YouTube walk me AdSense
Money off for you to buy ad says
Oh you're right but the fact I'm a rat then
And I rap huh I'm a laptop
Eminem holds the world record for rap god
1.6 k words though
We already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour
Underrated and I'm under powered
My bars are so filthy
Oh y'all need to take another shower
For every fan is a hundred doubters
And they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done
Cuz I gotta top my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean
Do exactly what my mom says
And I know what I headed for the top
Baby still we make a progress
I can spit bars for nine months
Then deliver you a new life
Yeah we eating in this bitch
Oh y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write the shit
Cuz I freestyle you still like the shit
See my video press like on it
That subscribe button better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat
I think it's time to change it
Cuz I spaz on trap
Oldschool boom-bap you name it
Think of that as an intro
Now we get into the meat of it
Did some shit you didn't see coming
I don't give a fuck about what you think of it

Hey hey uh
Switch up
Yeah hey hey hey

Look out the window see pastor but with fainter reflections
You never laugh like you used to you got Feiner expressions
You headed down the wrong path innate changing the races
Maybe don't mention about how I made me a blessing
And lately I question this shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stopping these conversations hey
How long do wait until the day you wake up
And thank God you made it
I don't like to dwell but man I gotta say it
Don't let my sons but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road to send up but you wait dr. Dre
Stop contemplating and stop complaining it recreated
Actually don't recreate it be creative
Reach the place where you still vibe in
That shit when we replay it
Live in a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you have it use nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah maybe those change when they see we made it
We had it all the new platforms and leaving the basics
Ah my creative process is making progress
Despite my background I haven't gone to play in Lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing going
I been watching all these shows while I could be showing
I've been creeping up on the doors so dangerous
You looking at statistics while I figure how I'm changing them
I don't learn so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice ain't it that's nice to be given advice
When I paint a head twice much the same and I
Can't even comprehend that much in a future
Hey it in the teacher but you love in the tutor
And to the game I'm a fucking intruder
Stealing these clothes man I'm stuck as a loser
Procrastinating cuz my fucking computer
No willpower I'm just stuck as a loser
Sitting alone at 3:00 a.m.
Chillin on a late night is the weekdays friend
Man this shit is too wild I must behave Ben
That's what the teachers are preaching to me but even when
I'm on the top of this drop in the rock in the world with confidence
Accomplishments toppling everyone and you try stop it
Obviously there's a problem is solving it just ain't up to me
Luckily I've been trained to test the system don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day you'll see we made it no you cannot recreate it
Although this pain is just alleviate err
I'm just trying to find a mindset running to be the greatest
That is why I'm striving living trying I'm fine I'm giving
Dignity crying I'm winning but feel like dying
I'm shining I'm like a diamond but I'm dead on the inside
Gets a novel best participant set it on my big mind
And I'm in time
Working on my life get that in line
I'm trying to figure out everyone get their pictures
Out nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on an incline I'm on an incline
Stay in your lane you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on an incline bitch I'm on that incline
Nobody can really understand how much thick climb
Have I been living yet spending time on the Internet
I'm wasting a hit in it I should be making
The aiming for girls but taking this shit instead
I stay in bed laughing a stupid shit Ludacris
Who is this tangible pendant with two new kids
Why am I doing this why the fuck do I care I don't but I kinda do
I don't know what I tried to do but whatever it is to say bye to you
Hey me I lie to you don't realize well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do when the skies are Gray you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do tell them to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlights go break lines kind of deadlines leave lines dead
I guess that I digress aside I just the way I am blessed
Impressed after I impress you seem intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on get your groove on for my new song
Do write and you too wrong at a big head Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate we're getting in line just to live with some quick ride
Some straight bugs we've came far but we're looking up on an incline

Wanna break
I got a lot to say
It's been 11 minutes so far I see hasn't been shorter

How can I have a believable man when I live in a paradise
Living a luxury nobody seen it'll great
But what if it's different I mean it's assuming there being this any conceivable dreaming
And it was so unbelievable being
He's sucking this river and achievable feeling
They're giving me something that ended up leaving
They giving me nothing I ended up ripping
Apart inside ended up seeing what life could be like from a different leading
Thank God for covers on so I don't want to wear it to cross it
All over the place I'm surprised I haven't lost it yeah
Hey and I'm feeling like I'm at the top
I'm living to the max now
Yeah that's how when I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up I never back down
More focus on my background
In the music and how my rap sounds
Speak up cut the track down
Go to the end it on back out
Stuck in the try figure that out
After I'll do the math now it's garbage
Take the trash out but I'm here to stay
Till I pass out back out
Okay it's time to go faster sit back and relax and just maybe you'll get it
About number maybe your matter said it you can pay attention he catch your credit
I had to let it go back to taking out some layers in the past that I had to edit
Never back in the middle of the track up let it mix it up and a few songs but now forget it
We moved on my pastor agent
Want you to come back and pass a message
Every fact tags and trash you're left to
Cover sucks and sometimes you have to edit
Money you tella am proud I spent it
If I ever have told you I'm a dementia
If you ever feel bad too sad too sad
To think back to the track in the rap that banded
Yeah pretty ugly some cousin it
Fit this time atop of maybe need to television
Full of little bit Amiga tell that I ended this voice
And more powerful than a million instrument study
There was going to look at somebody else
Do you want me to go buddy cut see
But I'm never gonna lever mind Esther be better
Than the people that never had trusted me
Yeah and I'm feeling like I'm at the top
Yeah live into the match now
Yeah that's how when I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up never back down
Won't focus on my background
In the music and how my brat sounds
Speak up and a messing with the track now
People are telling me that I'm falling short
Looking back at you when you're missing all the cash
Now and I'm mad at the fact
That I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half they keep on saying
Though the wrong words at a right time look into yourself
You never know what you might finally
Get this guy in the middle of the night
Time I find so much safe I wonder why I
Can't just find mine he's got so many
Confusing questions it's over solid I
Can't use the lessons I'm emerging now
With the new profession I'ma do the best
For my new perfection and I'm doing it
I'm moving on to this future shit these
Hooligans I can pictures of it they just
Don't understand that I am through with
It improving their I'm improving it I
Got my brain and I'm using it and I'ma
Make it out alive when I playing they're
Taking and making it's catching I'm
Tearing these tools to bits you're
Clueless 90% of y'all ignorant keeping
Your mind just a limited get off your
Hands because it is time to figure it
Out see me so close I can picture right
Now success of my drinking I'm sipping
And now and vision and deeper and
Bitches and now my getaway that is a
Limit about God huh my voice is going
Already shit I hey hey hey
Think I've got a consensus being lost in
The trenches adolescent lessons
Expressing cause job as attempt us
Making it hard to stay alive was so easy
To die making you hang your head low
Pass a reach for the skies life is a
Walking contradiction I see it through
Its lies and I'm just trying to tell the
Stories I've seen through its eyes I
Feel enforcing it feed enough reasons to
Cry but though this fake deep bullshit
I'm too eager to try yeah everybody
Sending blessings in need of reply
Trying to sell their own tears for they
Bleed any try fucking demons aside I'm
In need of the wide so I can summarize
My life to my breathing inside like oh
Well I could say that I tried hopped in
The life and then I stayed for the fight
So many beautiful faces but they bacon
Inside and I'm just patiently waiting
For the dead decide damn this reminds me
Of days when I Drive in a lay I'm
Screaming hide to the sky with the smile
On my face now I'm hiding my face I keep
Trying to trace all little steps that I
Take in to find I'm a place just down to
Ocean so lonely ways you're like an
Embrace and now
Mike Leggett said of the Prophet I used
To be an atheist but that turned the
Agnostic recently I've been wonderin if
I fucking lost it you see my friends
From kindergarten go to rehab that's the
Type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times blissfully ignorant
Minds before reality could proudest we
Would live in the skies and NASA and as
A kid I never thought I'd be being like
This man as a kid I never thought this
Would even exist
I felt elusive intangible des steam in
The mist and now I'm waking up feeling I
And even this shit you've only look at
What you got what you see that it's lost
And life's your gradual for me to
Believe in my sauce don't understand
Rappers bragging I got that paper on me
Man I got kids and schools are doing
Presentations on me so what the fuck you
Believe that you try to take that from
Me to me I'll take that over bullies and
Making some money
Rayna Sonny I'ma do this every day I'll
Study and write these lyrics til my
Brain is fuzzy damn like Ty Lee created
To read such as capital lies these
Romans Halle on my heads with the
Capital eyes there's a natural high I'd
Seen it coming from a farm stop baby
Surprise but I ain't Madison Scotty I
Wrote this album so much hash and I
Actually cried
They say cuz I was never trapped in my
Rack
Is a lie they said cuz I my awkward kid
I'm invalid as DJ Khaled son received
For the platinum plaque for being alive
Do I have for my album it wasn't good
Enough shit I mean it still isn't good
Enough I'm like an active volcano I know
I could've rub but I guess I am not full
Enough damn I swear the higher you get
That's the lower you feel man that's
What shit you gotta do or you won't get
A deal I mean that's what street you
Gotta prove so they know that it's real
30 seconds to listen and thinking you
Know how I feel ya say there's some
Motherfucking thesis statement yeah
Came a long way I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stress they have to
Be the greatest and if not an answer dad
Truly feel up wasted most of the
Pressure on my shoulders is coming from
Me so when I die no one like this was
Something to leave so when I wake up in
The morning with something to see yeah I
Got so much said that I'm wanting to be
Benny Ben Benjamin Selena Gomez I said
If you're ready come get it then
Everyone is jealous man you wanna get
Friends with them just in case he is but
I think our iPhone camera lenses to let
The Instagram evidence yeah I know I'm
Way too cocky but I'm working on

Figuring it all out so when people say

You can't that makes you wanna get

Better that's benefit of the doubt

On the top but is never dropping the

Bottom its opposite fun deposit have

Gone from talking often and I'm logged

In a pocket of all my jostling keep

Turning around always stopping my song

Says they keep burning the sound I'm

Late

Yup this is freedom of speech trying to

Murder all the people who'd be keeping a

Piece it sacrifice your whole life coz

You need a degree opportunity in front

Of you you need to achieve I'm like nah

I'm just trying to find some clarity

Apparently it all has to do with

Popularity there will be obstacles

Primarily people blind into what is

Carefully being prepared for me

Sometimes we'll have 11e paid for the in

Prosperity I'm asking Hillary Clinton to

Marry me too powerful in the very least

Giving you all of my money but never see

Legacy every day than I meant to see

Everyone here is impaired so scary and

Medicine but I know enemy cuz I go

Walking away - block and what Sapna K

Shot in the face gun loggin loaded them

Off at the race drop in the face officer

Place brought in a way predict you what

I will probably say and at the end of

The day still talking a Mesa obviously

Let the audience say so let me explain

This to to those who came in looking at

The state to see an awakened thing these

Famous when they don't understand that I

Take race and I make his from basic

Playlist to the greatest than the team

In the nation be patient was waiting for

Me to break in re-energize the lyrics to

Memorize start an enterprise a better

Guide so can I be successful and never

Try that's my dream job being lazy just

Sitting with the TV on they say that I'm

Right like me on ba I ain't taking

Responsibility pay me for having

With little humidity but whatever I'm

Doing it seems to be killing me I'm a

Willingly artistically fitting into this

History trying to show you one better

But none of you believe me trying to win

This go and try hard good game GG you

Beat me and now you see me in 3d but you

Can't feel me showing up on your device

Control option D Lee consider me part of

Heatley measure myself from retweets

I'll be talking away more chill so you

Can reach me instead of pretending you

Understand what I'm talking about I'm

Sipping you kind of scared for like a

Haunted house trying to show you

Something instead of just sitting on the

Couch I'll be honest now I rarely end up

Walking now into reality getting allowed

To be actually a high belief by myself

Doing nothing you don't laugh at me why

Cuz ideally you would do the same thing

Nothing cos for a brain that is amazing

It's now complaining but the best part

Of life is not even living it love

Sleeping and just using it and never

Much time is limited and I better figure

This perform slipping this opportunity

On my fingertips now let me just tell

You what I came to do trying to show you

Why can rap as fast as I'm able to

Trying to show you why can hop in here

Like a kangaroo and say some stupid

Metaphors and leave out there I'm

Breaking through and if a major record

Label is looking at me I'm a nice guy

With bad teeth got a nice ID for bad

Beats I can't use ride fast their raps

Slow I may make mistakes but everyone

Has so I'm like MJ back when he had the

Afro oh so I'm not black so maybe not

But before everyone gets angry stop I'm

That person they're people naturally

Heymy blood all the people who keep on

Going crazy off because I won't be

Making amazing songs in a mainstream car

A lot of prominent features I'm a

Confident speaker with some dominant

Teachers I deserve to be a starter but

Constantly on the bleachers I'm awfully

Smaller cheaper when I'm up on a spot

And eager baby fearing this every time

That they hear and it don't know that my

Lyrics had a precision of building a

Pyramid so when you live in this please

Let me know when I'm standing here

Frozen please let it go hit a metronome

Combine the compilation to unlock

Superstardom and move all across the

Nation but that it's just a dream and

Probably a combination of a big ego and

False encouragement on the way in but

When I'm playing it just know it's all a

Big game I'm just trying to blow up and

Have a big name but when you think about

It it is all insane working be created

From chemicals in this brain but when

You look at me a lack of respect when

I'm cracking my neck so that I can rap

To my chest cousin of bread some say

That it's magic I step until I'm on the

Same stage that you have it again but so

When you think about the Hall of Fame

You think about a people used to sit and

Call your name and you check and wonder

If it will be artists a step back into

Reality it all remains damn alright I

Just spilled water on my computer right

Now on my computers breaking while I'm

Doing this thirty thousand words shit

Goddamn it

My lyrics are not showing up on a swing

You know when

What I mean this is off the top I don't

Need to use no machines hold up I know I

Can freestyle but I can't do it forever

But I am very clever okay

Okay I'm gonna take a drink if you're

Watching this take a drink - these are

Some shit that you can drink - but drink

Water unless you're of age you know what

I'm saying hey okay okay hey I feel like

I'm Way too different ridiculous most of

Humanity's made of idiots I barely even

Get myself and you thinking you

Understand you think I to be highly

Screen gives you the upper hand please

What I do is barely poetry this hope for

Me I'm noticing people starting to

Notice me but still consider me

Confidence then consider me ready and

Giving out all my flawlessness bye

Honestly all of this is haunting me

Probably it is just a sense of myself

Wobble and toppling into awfully small

Pieces normally all leaving is tragic

And knobs leading it follows me all

Evening it's calling my name it

Constantly makes it so hard to stay away

I close my eyes I let it go and it all

Fades away yeah we're just trying to

Find a great escape to get away from how

We live in life day to day some people

Fight it in a drink or in a cup or in

Some bling or branded drug or any things

That give us love but all I know is that

It's tough and all I know is that the

Stuff isn't enough is way too much I'm

Showing you like this dictator man what

I gotta do to make this quick paper

These kid haters are like 10 years open

Still claim to be big players that shit

Will make me go but I'm aiming

Um and lo got amazing bronze in a crazy

Flow when I may be live but I came to

Show what I can do when I get on a mic

And I'm keeping it moving you sit in the

Hype and I'm seeing it the one success

Inside I don't take it for granted but

Blood to this life selling a romper

Getting a right like 2:00 a.m. in my

Head in the lake head of the bedroom I'm

Living the rest of my golf the bedding

And I get in there like I'll be living

In first class

I know the chena but will surpass gonna

Know worst half for this burn trash

Whenever I work fast

Remember the members they sent in and

Said and again and again and they never

Will ended si de splendor but never but

Legend and every cent as I say is

Perfected take a deep breath cuz I need

That most y'all don't even care what I'm

Saying you really just like our speed

Fast my bars are met I got metal bars

With meta eights and metaphors you want

Better chords and better cars but you

Don't know what I'm heading towards say

That I am the king of the shit crazy

Bronze ain't thinking today some singing

And rapping and making it happen and

Make you laugh while I'm bringing it

Shit trying to find the other way but

Y'all just waiting for another day cuz

What other 14 year old I hit a 100k I'm

Making the most of a crazier flow so

Many ways I can go I'm taking a ton of

You chillin and staying at home I'm

Willing to make it my own

I'm baking my kicky you know that I'm

Eating it even and staying up late is

The need a bit reason to stay in the

Same I just Leonid leaving my life while

I'm seen DC this which really these

People and feeling retreats in a fire

I'm hittin it pleasing these liars and

Peter so never received and agreeing to

Be on the lip and I'm leading it play so

Dope I think it's time that we take a

Break we go make mistakes and pay some

Here I got it always here to save the

Day cuz I am on top of it locked on my

Thoughts and I gotta be stopped in their

Balcony get on my flow and so dominant

Positive confident full of accordions

Compliments all the DS office is born as

Fuck no I am NOT a part of them start a

New person to church and I gotta be

Shuttered its artists aren't and man

Business variety targeted under

Older the others abandon me yeah drama

Further reason I'm needing to figure

This out how did I get to the stage I

Don't want to get up and stage to the

Shit every day and I won't give up

Whatever they say let them oppress her

Away but I just can't shoot my shot got

A bad gun so I hate this motherfucker

With a dream cuz he has won by now if

You're still watching this shit you are

A Bochy you deserves some plants for the

Shit but we're over we're done though am

I taking a break

Are you dumb bro well we near and tank

Hey but I'd still need 30k well you sit

Around I will rather work than play

Lyrics go through your dome through your

Vertebrae hit you back and forth till

You end up at the pearly gates now that

She pretty good boy

That's wrote Alec right it's had gonna

Go before it before this hey you know

Just to have some throw stuff in

Sometimes I don't know what to think

Sometimes I don't know what'll make it

Okay it make it okay I'm stubborn oh

They dreams yeah

Hey I wake up on the ridge and my mind

Is wandering all these opportunities

Let's wandered in my oxygen all

Accomplishments left harder than my lack

Of confidence often it's the result of

Falling under consciousness you make

Babies cry I make crazy lives you're

Just angry cause you're living in a

Fading light and I've been feeling this

Energy feeling that somebody's getting a

Penalty fever and I'm under you end up

Ahead of me feeling that this is the

Enemy huh will I tell you no never

I think I'm so clever but in the grand

Scheme of things I know that I'm no

Better but I don't ever wanna go to show

Just one mole

Ramaa go-getter I go get a's and get

Crazy and get AIDS and wake up and get

C's but get paid oh my life is so

Unusual to most it isn't suitable to me

Is irrefutable can see me in a cubicle I

Rather watch my funeral I rather go back

To stab my own brains out back in utero

Uh but you know that I'm capable you

Know I'm a pounce at any chance that is

Available feeling so unique and I think

It's not explainable no one hears my

Lyrics and says OMG relatable no that's

Not what I'm here to give been waited

Years for this year about to experience

Something that I've spent time money and

Thought on learned about all the times

Money had thought wrong kind of funding

It's long gone but time is crummy and on

Long I

I'm not calm not by a long shot out on

The inside see me on the outside I

Always think I'm positive and never see

The downsides it's about time you know

The truth you couldn't be further from

It get your head out your own ass you

Couldn't be further up it okay okay okay

We're like 30 minutes in 30 minutes but

We got thirty thousand bro fuck yeah I'm

The kid in the equation bitch you better

Be where I'm like the e that equals all

Other MC squared I'm just me performing

In front of empty chairs but y'all see

So only y'all better get prepared I got

So much opportunity I gotta make the

Most of issues made of the banana peels

I feel like I'm supposed to slip man and

It's like the old climbing and stable

Lad is it's not about it goes faster but

It's out the man will hold this grip

Damn I got a crazy ass work ethic

Blocked out south east and west leave in

One direction I finished my album and

People saying they love and they fuck

With it but I took it down and redid it

To perfection we go students a rap but

We don't learn lessons like an Eskimos

Jacket or than be furred yeah one

Fuckin unstarted like really bad again I

Didn't even had to ask for me to get her

Bless and that's a horrible bar you

Can't stand me cuz I crossed them up

Their ankles her in yeah uh yeah yeah

I'm an amazing person I base my

Motivation on my favorite angels words

About how I'm gonna make again a famous

Man attains a certain you keep it

Standards low I keep my standards high I

Wanna get on in the action like the

Prizes camera guy can't and I'm fucking

Insane sometimes I fantasize when it

Would be like to be normal if I this

Randomized and analyze my situations

Leaving people paralyzed and take a step

Out of bed hit me while I'm in my

Paradise America's very nice but I like

To see the world but I like to get out

Into the open and meet my girl and a

Mercedes Benz with this lady friends

Crazy Ben is just chilling with them

With me you know they'd be tense they'd

Be tense or more they'd be tense or more

I like to talk to all these people cuz

They marvel at my metaphors it's free

Speech I can say what I want

But these listening are trying to make

Me pay for my time they don't like what

I'm doing they don't appreciate the

Banter I get it get jealous but listen

Cuz I'm the answer

Motherfucker I'm I live for the right

Time fuck that

I'ma live for the moment sitting here in

The middle by the night time my mind

Puzzle with the thoughts that be flowing

Down I've been living in a headache

Bitches never listening it saying that

They ready but I can never believe them

Got these girls and they can never

Achieve them how can your dreams come

True if you ain't one

Damn that's a lot of shit to take about

Suddenly company starts to come to me

Wonder bring what I'm doing my next I

Feel it like that shit I gotta pick a

Route Mason Pitts I gotta get him out

Cut his dreams hell I'm living now in my

Mind's eye given out lots of songs with

Responses that I never pictured Wow damn

Damn

This beast way too holy to rap over

Mental block my minds capacities that's

Love with your raps lower they lack

Closer they lack substance like a

Printer without Tony y'all filling pages

That have nothing oh but I have got

Something to tell you I ain't got some

Money or bullshit to sell you speaking

From late nights I'm thinking the

Drake's like watching these inner who's

Thinking one day I might be on that

Stage right beside all these players

Shit's up to me I won't hide it in

Prayers I'll prove it in the music I

Used to influence I do this to wait

Harder than people assuming resume in my

Writing if you win this lighting that

Puts me to be in the view of the height

And I do what they like and but that

Makes them hate me no matter what I do

They just mistake the reason I'm flowing

The reason I start up not just for the

Fame and the money this dumb person

Damn I talking about the carpet place

Most to these rappers only bright this

Shit using copy/paste I'd have made a

Lot of songs that go to waste I just

Need a homerun I already loaded bass is

I have got so many cases been visiting

Live in in so many places experiences

That I made me

- Emmy then be and please I hope you let

Me be me I ain't greedy or needy believe

Me I just want to be on your TV get on

My level cuz I need a new staircase down

Yeah I've been looking at this face then

One day I'll be there I know what I'm

Doing when I'm already prepared I've

Been waiting like Dirty Dozen tears

Trying to make the world listen so make

Sure that you can hear I'm trying to

Take a passion out of turning my career

I'm concerned without my fear but I'm

Hurting and I'm here now earned it and

I'm here to stay I'm coming in you're

Trying to clear the way another chance

Another fucking here to play not even

1718 I'm so near to fame not really look

At all the shit I just here to stay look

At the future nostalgically I cure every

Disease and y'all still wouldn't be

Proud of me and doubtedly know how to be

What I am about to be to say that money

Talks and that shit seems so damn loud

To me recently I have been feeling

Alienated my songs out of this world

People claim that aliens made I'm a baby

I'm crazy don't hate me don't hate me

Cuz I'm different but hate me because

You hate me then maybe we can live with

That people say that this is the biggest

Thing to hop on the screen all will

Scream overreacting like it's a trauma

Scene y'all are meanest is the best

Quality is honesty promise me that it's

The reality where's Keanu Reeves trapped

In a matrix it's how I felt some time

Back in their ages and I rap on a stage

Does it now elapsed those days are now

Moving on move on why you lose the song

Look for long nothing to see here except

Some stupid pause boo boo Kabam is whole

Place up with one great lung one great

Song

That one great one on vacation I vacate

To a location far away from where people

Just may run a light to go to where

There is no one no one no fun osa I'm

Trying to be me and so young I can

Murder this beat with no gun go one I've

Too many problems to handle here

Hold one I just wander the rat boat but

That ship has no sons and our puns can

Make loud junk

Uptown funk was a great song catchy at

First but the radio station playing and

Making it just get to the boys my head's

Gonna burst if I hear it again and I'm

Sure I'll stall my speakers on the

Ground denting the earth and now I'm

Adding this verse and I mean it now that

Ain't gotta span just keeps on bleeding

Yeah good rappers never get to see the

Light of day but when you sell it sexing

And gimmick the sign in right away

I'll obey now whatever man what is this

I'm read as a fence and a mess and I

Playing my trike so that people will

Know I'm a business nobody witness

Anything better than when I am showing

You did she know I'm suspicious because

I'll be flowing and going like oh this

Kid is big no I live it gonna mission

Y'all better listen til I'm ahead of

This shit by all of the inches yeah and

When I uh I'm telling y'all that I got

It star regarded noise we stopped the

Glory coppers forming an auditory now

Visually typically the original me so

Unforgivable so inexplicable obvious and

Pinnacle digitally damn that was fast

Felt so gentle I unpacked and I'm just

Trying to prove to you the things that I

Can move on the track and I'm trying to

Get a record deal never ever felt so

Real whenever we're the guests to feel

Whenever this gets to feel so different

And I'm loving

Time to change the discovery time to

Make a difference and I'm living it so

I'm up for it I always talk to my mother

Kids their mother kids couldn't

Understand me one path making a nun

Ain't gonna stop for plan B I wrote that

One a long time ago that was the first

Time I look I looked at those again but

You know I started note that rusty not

That rusty I'm actually classic we just

Living in a solar system one big world

Here to hold the visit them

One big dare to control the victims

We're all here trying to find a soul and

Rhythm and a voice or writing a choice

Decided whether or not to follow what

The boys are like and what the girls are

Doing or what we got it'd be exposed to

Think about who you are and it's so true

Think about the people who you think I

Really know you do they really know you

Do you even know you damage it is like a

Jaden Smith tweet sometimes you gotta

Stand out crazy shit B and lately it

Seems to make the extreme so prominent

And dominant and making big dreams

I'm seeing a legion screamed when I go

To sleep man my brain is fixing no I'm

Just trying to make it a life fuck you

To the people who be saying that like I

Ain't making the right he take a

Vacation and hike

Despite the fact that I'm young and a

Little bit nerdy and I know a lot of

People would consider me early I'm just

A little kin working trying to configure

My search is trying to deliver my

Purpose and take a shit on my burdens

I'm just me no my ain't no fake

And I just see all the people living and

Burning so be free try to be a little

Bit nervous it don't matter if he's

Scared cause this shit is disturbing and

Ending and I know where this flaming so

Well see a brown underachievers hop on

Be leavin man so basically I do this for

Fun and making me I'm trying I'm a black

Girl gone so fast I be getting my career

From A to Z and basically I'm where you

But now what am I meant to do what my

Own fan base I hated me I've been

Suppose this using the fans like crooks

Manipulated the Ronnie hands to catch

That hook they'll believe anything that

You tell them like you can feed that

Shit so you could sell your book huh but

No shots fired though nothing wrong with

A little bit of lying though I mean look

Their entire show but no political shit

Bitch but I feel of the syllables a

Little Brazil because I render bullshit

You to help me understand I need some

Closure because truthfully I give a damn

But see I ain't no pleasure man see I'm

A middle man of it man and it means it's

There digging in the sand looking for a

Reason I'm not kidding man

How am I gonna let all of this get him

Even a few much as you texted me chill

Others tell myself I'm a celebrity in a

Way that we could get to me and in the

Didn't matter but right now is feeling

Like everything the more talking about

Wedding ring but now I'm thinking about

So many things

What did I do to deserve it the shit I

Was pretty a petty things I'll stick

Them I let you forget about it and all

That they're gonna set about it but why

The fuck that I get blocked I just kind

Wrap my head around it now I'm just

Getting bored I'm just fuckin up all the

Flows just for the fun of it if you're

Still watching this shit comment a

Comment Arrowhead water in the comments

Out of 10 give me a rating that way I

Know that you're real they are real one

You know I'm Sam alright wheel

Spectacular speculations having some

Reservations imagining all the

Statements to tribal authorities places

Back an impressive passionate ration of

Reputations that actually don't affect

Some reality left and basis I wish that

We left the nameless associate and more

Faces make judgments from expectations

And watch the heads of shaken people

Want me to crumble and turn to some

Medication to fuck up my motivation and

Focus on education but I'm a petty petty

Petty petty let's are they really ever

To me so many times that you convinced

Me and shit that is so you could have

Won a penny I got a phone in my hand

Like an over the gram and I think I'm

Holding your hair but you don't

Understand I think I'll be the total

Scam you never really know to the end

Like oh this began I'll become in the

Heads of the mansion I forgot more than

A plane how does of the dramas around me

Here follow without like another one

Here by the shit again I guess that's

The way it goes when they stop me and do

Anything to try and stop me I did

Nothing wrong but that's how it goes

When aphasia bitch try to block me

But you stay the same how you expect

Yourself to go take the fan making name

But you don't take the pen you wanna be

Unique but not make it change like what

How you expect to go through this think

About the girls man why you wanna do is

So stupid and useless if you never lose

It with yourself a little for the

Movement when I write the st. the ode to

Joy' this the oldest success don't know

If there is a God but I know that I'm

Blessed and I'm hoping to know and I'm

Open to yes I'll do whatever I can to go

To the best that will go to the right

And go to the left no doubt imma show up

At night instead of going to bed when I

Know that I'm right I'm exploding my

Chest I keep on loading the time and it

Goes over my head I think no why do I

Even try these things I need shiny

Things like diamond rings and flying

Rings and preci bling that is what

Drives these strains I'm so I'm so

Lively and lazy at the same time saying

Something sane and crazy in the same

Rhyme never go to practice who don't

Faze me til it's game time

Learning his life will amaze me how I

Made my define a minute

When a wetland is favorite the mik

Children they get so pissed with me I'm

Either villain now they no kidding and

No I'm not quitting I know I'm just

Sitting sitting with a dream and maybe

Maybe just sit in this city where the

Dream could take me but I know it can't

I know it tastes look I'm angry why I

Just need to be of the a-team at the

Feet of the mainstream man I dream for

This daydream and I believe that I'm

Making it cease for the taking it's me

In a train and I see that I'm breaking

My knees aren't place and I keep on

Thinking that I'm being amazing but I'm

Improving I know it's just a slow climb

Pushing myself yeah I'll be there in no

Time so I'm moving I'm moving till I get

There get where I just don't want to get

Left there I don't remember I don't even

Take no credit for anything that I do

But I live life with a positive attitude

That's why I've seen pissed but I'm

Places shit nobody else's world did and

Love my man it's really hard cuz you

Need some love I've been waiting cuz

This is defense time for me to be laying

Out of business and I'm breathing in the

Air but it all tastes

When all of this time is wasted really

Ain't wasted this is trash I've done it

When I wrote this I then wrote it's like

2013 this how far back up this how far

Back we are I'm not even I write this

Let's do something else

Oh cuz this I said it's bumping bumping

This beat is just so disgusting you

Grief of my love and I'm enchanted he's

Damn the speed is just full of something

That's making me wanna get up and

Breathe another percussion man I'm

Dancing yeah dancing man I'm feeling the

Rhythm dropping my head fancy snares

That when it hit something really gets

In my bloodstream like just make sense

To me bass and a good groove it's really

A great recipe can't mess with me no

Feeling too good in the moment feeling

New when I go in and feeling blue when

It's over when I'm not a yes and then I

Am applauding next and then I'm trying

To mentally send God attacks like hey

Real but listen to how this box if you

Supposedly feel like a god well you get

What I'm saying and god damn my tap

Police press when I'm paying I said it's

Hide yeah we be feeling and know that

Come running to me I said we coming in

Dream no never mind probably not but I

Constantly got energy that's lost to my

Thumb

Caused them a lot but looking at the end

Result man we've accomplished a lot

And now I'm not gonna regret a thing

After this I'm just trying to master

This cuz right now I'm known as that

Weird eye trapping kid the fact of it is

That it is really just a giant hobby

Something for me to be original not a

Lie copy trying to make a shit you can

Really get your head not inverses so

Fire less when it's done if left

Sobbing it's just a work in progress

Some of my shame is shit and other words

Are nonsense but now we ease it up we

Gotta be this bumpers see me stuntin

While I'm Flo movie it doesn't see me

Bluffing every day and see me bluffing

That is what I do listen to some

Bullshit trying to make a substitute I

Got so much stuff to do when I am just a

Young and to who just hopped on the

Scene everybody one or two but all I

Know is that we find the safety and

Rhythm and that is the reason that I am

Making the same an asset is pompey naira

Gets better but I'm just gonna move with

Ring it's a very much the same if I

Can't afford to say now scared for King

Brain reason to believe in you even

Own evil man that is a truth and a lie

Truth in a line something like the blue

In the sky was to in a tide yeah I'm new

The time man I'm like a proof in

Disguise and all and we're gonna all of

Minute and

Become an acquaintance I probably get

Richer by focusing left you close minded

Let's open it up and all these people

Assume about what I'll be doing but

They're gonna know when it's up just

Wish that they go away I'm gonna bei

Know what we'll never ever show the way

I'm I will try to mask it up with other

Jokes and fucking jokes always playing

Achieve but now I'm moving on to other

Notes

My voice is fucking and hurting it's

Pretty a lot I know I haven't vocal

Training so I don't know how to do this

For a long period of time without

Causing damage to my vocal cords but who

Gives a fuck man I just delivered up I'm

Gonna go a little bit quieter now uh-huh

Yeah oh look it's people keep on

Changing all of these times and

Different phases all of these lights on

All the stages all the sights are so

Amazing yeah I've seen at least a

Million faces a million times a million

Places felt when it's all said and done

I look and I wonder why everyone knows

That so amazing

Compared to the big people at the

Capitol my name is felt on many cases

People loved me before I made a few

People like the before they watch their

I wanna wait too much one and I haven't

I'm glad because now I'll never stop a

Man on a mission

Teaching of talking a lot of wisdom and

I gotta listen got a following be the

Leader but tomorrow I'll be the teacher

When he need to feature got Blauman said

Him crazy she visited me so amazing I'm

Holding controlling the feeling the

First of the hurts because I am I'm

Later phases in Vinci I know the basics

Already know them I aggravated me while

People they know the players don't know

The game but don't many majors don't

Know the favorite but we can hear the

Caterer I meet the one proven to show

Just go on the players it big I'm going

So later I got time my only race I got

Now I'm in I'm on time for the broad

Lines and I'm not crying so let's go and

Let's go

My own people keep calling my phone one

And I know then I'll be the star of the

Show but I'm all on my own

Yeah and I don't want to talk about it

Stop the doubt it because the world is

Awfully crowded but the ghost in me is

Han and the tongue so I'll make it there

All on my own

My inner mission is amazing with

Intermissions and following integration

Conflicting with my decisions and it is

More than the business consists of self

Approval it is to make it look like I'm

Living with something beautiful many sad

But you know is true for most PQ

Appearances is right in front of coal

Just you chabot pursuit of drama moving

To a new type of day that you can gain

From to push away to pass in the places

That you came from day one for me was

Like six months ago

Oh holy shit I actually reached the end

Of the beat but I still have like ten

Thousand more words hold on I got a

Pause this hold on

Three it still want a pass in the places

That you came from day one for me was

Like six months ago

Look at where we've been better matter

But once you go it's not fun to know

That we just live in to die it's not fun

To know that we just live in a die we

Now know how much money you can get for

The line get for the look about how much

You can get for an eye what's the point

Of feeling shit if you just live in the

Cry so get your ass up cause it's time

To make it

Shitty laughing but I practice for my

Passion man yeah either living life all

On my own bitch I ain't start with a

Show bitch I know like four people who

Truly respect your pride and it's

Usually left to climb in a newly

Perfected diamond and if time is money

Then free time it really free and all my

Benefits Kazan lyrics a drilling me

Stemming from a branch of a wish list on

My Christmas tree I wanna be with ton of

Me but sorry gamma meaning me in the

Face of my full potential that is the

Biggest me bigger than you bigger than

Anybody in history the challenge is a

Challenge the fact that you got to

Maximize the satisfy a lavish life I

Have a crazy magic timer luckily I'm so

Damn young cuz man I had the time to

Learn from my mistakes and grow into a

Mastermind I'm trying to master my craft

And the problem is the high guard in

Several different things to potentially

Make my job I want to make the MLS and

Also have a merely subs and also gather

Millie plays and maybe make a big bucks

And maybe young should all be ever

Wanted small really and once I get three

Mil again on my for Millie it's so silly

Is so tricky this whole cycle we can

Never be happy but that is so vital

Those are some builders

Rebirth fee hit the earth my knees hurt

They're weaker than previously her

Breathing seems to be burnt like a three

CDs were before be could be sir sunlight

Please just please work like a lien

Slave owner that's edgy like great snow

So you get me a safe go for the belly

More than a seven-figure who cares about

Flexing if you ain't holding a heavy ah

People I knew puddin I like what I do

Discussing like it yet it should go that

He complains and now I'll become true

Do other the things that I do it's time

Shoes fitting these piece and news10 I

Should really get screwed it gives me

The pillars whenever I'm sure down my

Eyes on the doors I don't get a feel for

The finger rinses really please don't

Why the singer must be carrying kids and

Why the say there was a clear vicious

And I get Michele immense AB innocent

Magnificently backed up but nobody must

Step it up I didn't see Nicole Madonna's

Coming up okay to the Vatican having

Them good times and bad times new Romans

Do that again when I was when I was so

Young too young to really know fun but

So but I guess that's what happens when

You grow up dry your eyes and wipe your

Nose up just keep drinking till you

Been watching till until the end you

Ever gonna change but it did though yeah
Hey recently I've been feeling my lyrics
Missing meaning I'm trying to whitewash
How much they stink like I'm list arena
Damn I'm feeling like I've missed the
Key and so I guess that DJ Khaled is
Always skipping me but yeah you know I'm
Trying to do what I can but these
Ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah you know I'm trying to do what I
Can but these ignorant idiots just can't
Understand I got new crews and a new
Friends got new views in the new lens on
The new dude I'm the new bank on my
YouTube but a new trance but the way I'm
Growing is so unorthodox how could I be
Connecting them áfive you had to sort
The dots sort of lost them very found at
The same time a port of cause now I'm
Very loud in a daytime and very quiet at
Night each team is shy when I write and
I'm longing to be a five-year-old
Chillin flying a kite and I admire the
Sight of somebody just working more than
Me I've been staying grounded but the
Sky is moving towards my feet and
Fortunately I'm on course Livermore
Burley grinding to get what's rightfully
Mine I'm headed right for my dream
Damn I guess that's all I needed know
For now they put me in the driver's seat
No way I'm slowing down they know me now
But don't know my son did it so profound
Give me them two years and I'll make it
Let me show you how hey hey hey hey I
Got a stop all of this bragging shit so
Many haters as a mace is the acronym I'm
Trying to get a couple OMGs over WTF he
Is so sexy I got no Ben leave it be the
So deadly walked up to the rap club no
Entry and I feel a little like I won't
Get see cuz I'm so white won't fight you
Don't get me cuz I'm coming that his
Music with a different set of ideas he's
Trying to bring my own crib like it's
IKEA here's a protip
No gifts from people who are close yet
Bitch is always so stressed damn cuz
They trying to find a great escape
Nation of dreamers who are just trying
To stay awake every day I'd be waking up
To my 8 away stay today hustle I'm just
Trying to pave a way people that have
Colors always get them most advice it's
Like why don't you search your own lif
Don't come closer mind I mostly find it
So please leave me alone - whining next
Time that you're talking shit please
Bring me an open mind cause people
Loggin they own ideas a straitjacket
Some David Blaine's magic you're helping
Your brake pads that I'm trying to raise
- I'm trying to stay savage you're
Trying to make balance while finding a
Great pageant you coming to get up this
Witness an injustice about who people in
Love with the base of a skin color
Snitchin is so dis custody in their
Public I'm trying to make sense of it
Here and it discusses close my eyes and
Go to sleep waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations I'm making
Everything so complete my thoughts I
Scattered find lots of patterns I try
Not to let akin my plots and ashes I
Don't ever think on some money some
Little talent these rappers shows look
Like lifting battles with Jimmy Fallon
We're really having I'm jealous if
People selling platinum boy see around
My life like saying the words Kendrick
Goblin is way better than average
I'm already established unforgettable
Classic y'all shit is set to go plastic
You didn't want to see me disappear like
Incredible magic cube regretable
Attitude is upsetting my passion I'm
Gonna listen to place we're gonna simply
Gaze ajik to commute birth breakouts
Part of my baby minimal break humming
It's good enough in a bitch Eden a
Feelin if I just want to make a pulling
Up I'm putting up with all the amateurs
Or enough I'ma show him how it can be
Done I got green in our beef like a
Omnivore
I got that exclusive floater can't be
Bought at stores POTUS knew should they
Still be running more to say that my
Duty is not fair like some mana war I'm
Stuck as well just like the Michelin Man
It is sushi every night but I don't live
In
Damn I'm trying to get as many hits as I
Can and like a lazy ass beaver I ain't
Giving a damn whoa the shit's corny
You're really gonna ignore me you really
Gonna let it slide when the Benjamins do
Adore me and as you guys man it ain't
About fame and fortune we got a greater
Importance that's why awakened I'm born
And I'm trying to play her performance
Hit make a change with a chorus I came
From a tiny clap / nama stage of the
Normans let's do anything to stay out of
Office because I'm cautious it's not
Gonna sell myself for the profits yeah I
Got many dreams a lot of passions imma
Get there by any means just imagine just
Know that anything can happen to take
Chances for everything you rapping I
Don't even really need to go fast flow

Glad you're they don't melt like a
Snowman back-to-back flames got Drake

Friends who want to end on my shit and
Subscribe like I'm on a man I've been
Living in a moment got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the
White vans you can't lie man I got a lot
Of white fares could I get a ultralight
Beam maybe by chance every day I've been
Switching up on my stairs scare
Everyone away whenever I dance people in
A comment saying that I can't rap okay

A sandbag if you want to talk trash say

Ham in a lead not far from a newer place
Getting sick over and sicker the flow on
The track in and quick over and quicker
