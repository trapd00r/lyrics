Around the world
Around the world
All around the world
We could make time
Rompin and a stompin
cause Im in my prime
Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
cause Im down for
The state of pennsylvania

I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
bout the girls
From california

Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good God girl
I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know its you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby
cause Id like to say
Ive been around the world
Back from bombay

Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride
Step aside my johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of wisconsin

Wake up the cake
Its a lake shes kissin me
As they do when
When they do in sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know its you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me

I saw god
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin in the swiss mountains

Me oh my o
Me and guy o
Freer than a bird
cause were rockin ohio

Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
cause life is beautiful

I know I know for sure
$%%&*^&^$#$@##%&^*(*(&%%^$%$
I know I know its you

Ive been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know its you

You say hello then I say I do
