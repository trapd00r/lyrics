Yeah, from New York to Japan my plan will slam
Holding my own up in this piece
DJ Premier and of coarse DJ Honda
Jazzy Jay in the house, check it out
It's goin' on right here, international type vibe
Check the moves kid

I came to get the doe, what you expected
I came to mack the hoes, what you expected
I came to strictly flow, what you expected
Look out, I'm about to blow, hit the exit

Next in command
It's the 5 foot 8 and three quarter warrior
Take a stroll down my corridor
I can effortlessly instantly burn MC's into effergy

It's treachery
'Cause my skills have developed
I envelope situations that I'm facin'
Each lacin' and I'm chasin' those the suppose

That their game wasn't so fat
Yeah, right punk you know that, forget the media labels
'Cause most of the ducks are fucked up and unstable
Scared of the black stuff but I like to act up
And get real ill 'cause I'm too hot to chill, stupid

I came to get the doe, what you expected
I came to mack the hoes, what you expected
I came to strictly flow, what you expected
Look out, I'm about to blow, hit the exit

What you expected

Pussy step back, fake jake
I don't get down like that
I kick the facts then I sit and I mack
With a sound like that you a 1000 wack

Get a think link, try to hang
And bang now your head swings
'Cause my intellect is universal
For me to do or die with no rehearsal

One verse will take you outta
The weak format and bitch MC's can take a powder
Still you scower and skin your grill up
But you'll be a casualty that got filled up
With my ammo 'cause I slam your ass to the concrete
You got defeated punk

What you expected

Came to collect my loot, what you expected
I like the girl that's cute, what you expected
Givin' MC's the boot, what you expected
I do my duty, what you expected

What you expected

Five albums deep into this rap game
I slap lame 'cause straight is my aim as I state my claim
As the Bald Head Pimpsta here to administer
Sinister attacks upon those who lack
Thee ability to finesse the beat vocal techniques

I slam like Dominique
And you know my rhymes are punishin'
Like torture to your structure
Brain cells rupture what you expected

What you expected

I came to get the doe, what you expected
I came to mack the hoes, what you expected
I came to strictly flow, what you expected
Look out, I'm about to blow, hit the exit

Came to collect my loot, what you expected
I like the girl that's cute, what you expected
Givin' MC's the boot, what you expected
I do my duty, what you expected
