[Chorus]
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
When we had a love, so sweet, so true
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
Until you told me you had found somebody new
(Don'tcha remember?)

[Verse 1]
Look at your [?] girl
Look at your face
There's too much sadness in your face
For your makeup to erase
It's in your eyes baby
The pain you feel is in your eyes
I can see it baby
And your smile is no disguise

[Chorus]
Remember
(Do you remember when?)
When I told you not to leave
(Do you remember when?)
I tried to tell he would only make you grieve
Do you remember?
(Do you remember when?)
I told you leaving me was wrong
Now he's hurt you girl
(Do you remember when?)
He's left you standing all alone

[Verse 2]
I still remember when your love was mine
Your face was all aglow, your eyes they used to shine
Now there's sadness in your face and our love has gone to waste
The love I begged you not to take
I told you girl it was a big mistake!

[Chorus]
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
When we had a love, so sweet, so true
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
Until you told me you had found somebody new

[Verse 3]
Now look at what he's done to you
Look at how you've changed
There once was laughter in your eyes and now there's only pain
What happened to your smile?
Where did it go?
What has it done to you baby, how did he hurt you so?

[Chorus]
Remember when
(Do you remember when?)
When I begged you not to leave
I tried to tell you darlin'
(Do you remember when?)
That he would only make you grieve
Remember
(Do you remember when?)
You said you found somebody new
I told you darlin'
(Do you remember when?)
That I could love no one but you

[Verse 4]
Oh my love, you know you're always welcome
To my arms, welcome to my heart
My heart is yours, yours alone
It's full of love and it's strong
Same sweet love I offered you
When you [?] that it wouldn't do!

[Chorus]
(Do you remember?)
Ohh I know you remember darlin'!
(Remember when)
When we had a love, so sweet, so true
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
Until you told me you had found somebody new

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, baby come home girl
I'll take you back
(Remember when)
I still love you darlin'
(Remember when)
Everythings gonna be alright
Come on home girl
(Remember when)
I need your soul!
I need you darlin'!
(Remember when)
More than you'll ever, ever, ever know
(Don'tcha remember?)
Come home girl!
