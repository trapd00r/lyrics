It's dark and cold tonight 

I'm walking all alone 

And one step at a time I'm getting closer 

I know she's hard to find 

Instinctively I try, 

To take the path of love into the night 

There would be no reason if you really didn't care 

There would be no reason for love 

The door is open wide is anybody there? 

I know this must be the room in your heart 

I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe 

I know this must be the room in your heart 

No answers question me 

No one's been here before 

I'm the first to see the light at your door 

If I could hold you now I would not disagree 

With these four walls you're protecting me 

There would be no reason if you really didn't care 

There would be no reason for love 

The door is open wide, is anybody there? 

I know this must be the room in your heart 

I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe 

I know this must be the room in your heart 

I can feel it, I can feel it 

I can feel the love that's surrounding me coming out of you 

I can feel it 

The door is open wide, is anybody there? 

I know this must be the room in your heart 

I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe 

I know this must be the room in your heart 

I know this must be, I know this must be 

Is anybody there 

The door is open wide, is anybody there? 

I know this must be the room in your heart 

I really don't know why but it's so easy to breathe 

I know this must be the room in your heart
