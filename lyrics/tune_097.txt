[Kelly:]
I feel unhappy
I am so sad
I lost the best friend
That I've ever had

[Ozzy:]
She is my baby
I love her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go

[Both:]
We're going through changes (ohh - [chorus])
We're going through changes (ahh - [chorus])

[Kelly:]
We've shared the years
We've shared each day
I love you daddy
But I found my way

[Ozzy:]
You know the world
Is an evil place
My baby is grown now
She's found her way

[Both:]
(ohh ahh - [Chorus])
We're going through changes (ohh - [chorus])
We're going through changes (ohh - [chorus])
(ahh - [Chorus])

[Kelly:]
It took so long
To realize
I can still hear
His last goodbyes

[Ozzy:]
Now all my days
I'm filled in fears
Wish I could go back
And change the years

[Both:]
We're going through changes
We're going through changes (changes - [Chorus])
We're going through... Changes

[Both:]
Changes
Changes
Changes...
