I got a mad mans kind a frustration
Just another product of the anger in the nation.

Listen I'm confessing
Every day I learn a lesson
But I'm still breathing
God that's my blessing
So one for the trouble never losing kind
Lets get it on
Let me blow your mind!

Ain't it strange how things change
When they take you from the ground
And put you in the fast lane
But I never knew a shiny happy home
So I be just fine going to my terrordome

I got a mad mans kind a frustration
Just another product of the anger in the nation.

1 for the trouble, 2 for hard times.

People get ready sun for the shiny times

Listen I'm confessing
Every day I learn a lesson
But I'm still breathing
God that's my blessing
So one for the trouble never losing kind
Lets get it on
Let me blow your mind!
