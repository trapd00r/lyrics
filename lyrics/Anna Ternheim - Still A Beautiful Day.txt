We could say one day at a time makes it useless to try
Maybe this mountain is ours ahead a heavenly climb
A pile of ashes the wings of a moth drawn to the flame
Sooner or later you learn

Still it's a beautiful day
As long as I'm with you
I don't believe anything could taint the sky

We burn the fuse at both ends
Tell me how can I keep my baby safe
We could say one day at a time
Makes it all worth while

Still it's a beautiful day as long as I'm with you
I don't believe anything could
Keep our backs turned away from the grave
As long as I'm with you
I don't believe anything could
