well can you hear me out there?
i send this message to you
transmitting out through the air
signals into the blue
it's earthboy calling on frequency ten
all far out galaxies
i'm beaming love out to my one special friend...
...are you receiving me?

on your mission of love?
whizzing onwards at warp factor nine

just hanging out in deeper space
i'll send more messages of love
to keep a smile upon your face
