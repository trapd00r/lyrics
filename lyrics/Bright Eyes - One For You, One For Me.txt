One for the righteous
One for the ruling class
One for the tyrant
One for the slaughtered lamb
One for the struggle
One for the lasting peace
One for you and One for me

One for the Führer
One for his child bride
One for the wedding
One for the suicide
One for the bunker
One for the broadcast booth
One for me, now One for you

How did we get so far away from us?
How did we get so far away?

One for the people
One for the parliament
One for the weary
One for the malcontent
One for the master
One for the protégée
One for you and One for me

One for the breadlines
One for the billionaires
One for the missing
One for the barely there
One for the certain
One for the real confused
One for me, okay, now One for you

Now that we've come so far away from us
Now that we've come too far to say
You and Me, You and Me
That is an awful lie
You and Me, You and Me
That is an awful lie
It's I and I
It's I and I
It's I and I
It's I and I
