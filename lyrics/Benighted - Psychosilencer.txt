Buried in a cage
The bottom of the well is so deep
Reflection, the only answer
Can't read this piece of mind,
In this pit so deeply dug
As the surface is shaking,
So violently restrained, needs annihilated

Skin is everything, conjuring the crippled parts
As a physical shield protecting the untouchable
This furtive shadow swimming insidiously,
Threatening to catch your throat
Choking you in nonsense
Feeding the strong, consuming the weak

Neurosis failed, my psychosilencer

Worship the fear in its most silent form
Infinite and majestic,
And your glance betrayed that
You never knew - who I truly was,
Nevertheless will you be forced to deal
With the fear of what your eyes can't see
Swimming in the dark water of the underground maze

Feeding the strong, consuming the weak
