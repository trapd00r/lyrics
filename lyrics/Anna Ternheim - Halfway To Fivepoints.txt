How to get to fivepoints
Make the wrong turn you know
If you're thinking of going
Think no more

Who's taking you down there
What's his name
Let me know
The price he offers
Round the corner of love

Halfway to fivepoints
Is as far as you come
Halfway with high hopes
Of love

So be careful, my love
Be careful, my girl
Be careful with love

How to get to fivepoints
How would I know
A place so distant
And so long ago

Halfway to fivepoint
Is as far as you come
Halfway with high hopes
Of love
