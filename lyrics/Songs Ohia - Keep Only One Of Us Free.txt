The space you gave to me
You marked out dividing lines
Keep only one of us free
Keep only one of us free
The frame that held me
The frame that held me
Has rotted away
Has rotted away
Now we are paired again
Back with friction
Back with friction
Back with friction
And black angel falls in with one of us again
And light is barely breathing its breath between us
Between black angel black angel black
We have lost what we had marked
Out for ambition
Out for ambition
Now only one of us are free
Only one of us are free
Only one of us are free
