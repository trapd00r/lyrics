No Gangboss, no!
We don't want the whip!

As we get weaker...

We don't want no Gangboss
We want to equalize

We...
Gang...
We want to equalize

No Gangboss, No!
We don't want the whip

As you get weaker
It will get harder
So don't be like him
Keep your bones
Of effort and strength
Don't sell them to him

We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize
We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize

To my father's
Father's father
Work was no joy
When his son
Had grown of age
You've got to work now my boy
Father's
Father's father
They had to work hard, boy
Never ceasing
For many years
Want to follow that, boy?

We don't want no gang boss
We want to equalize
We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize

'Til half and half is equalized
Oh, put down the tools
See the car
See the house
See the fabulous jewels
See the world
You have built it
With shoulders of iron
See the world
But it is not yours
Say the stealers of Zion

We don't want no gangboss
We have to equalize
We don't need no gangboss
We want to equalize

Fat
Wall Street
Who made them so fat?
Well, well
Me and you
Better think about that
In overdrive

'Til humanize
Is equalize
Put down the tools
Every face
On every side
Throw down the tools

We don't want no gangboss
We want to equalize
We don't need no gangboss
We need to equalize

Stay at home
Don't check with Rome
Paint a strike on the door
It's one to one
The fight is on
So don't go to war

We don't need no gangboss
We need to equalize
We don't need no gangboss
We need to equalize
