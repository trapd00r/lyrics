Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Sleep lay behind me like a broken ocean
Strange waking dreams before my eyes unfold
You lay there sleeping like an open doorway
I stepped outside myself and felt so cold

Take a look at my new toy
It'll blow your head in two, oh boy

Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone

I thought about it and my dream was broken
I clutch at images like dying breath
And I don't want to make a fuss about it
The only certain thing in life is death

Take a look at my new toy
It'll blow your head in two, oh boy

Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone

Where you want to be
Won't you ever see

Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everybody (oh, oh, oh)
Truth hits everyone
