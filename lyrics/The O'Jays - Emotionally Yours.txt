Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me your the one
I could be learning, you could be yearning, to see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours

Come baby, rock me, come on baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart
Come baby, teach me, come baby, and reach me, let the music start
I could be dreaming but I keep believing your the one I'm living for
And I will always be emotionally yours

It's like my whole life never happened
When I see you, it's as if I never had a thought
I know this dream, it might be crazy
But it's the only one I've got
It's the only one that I've got

Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied
And you know that I will always be emotionally yours
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide
