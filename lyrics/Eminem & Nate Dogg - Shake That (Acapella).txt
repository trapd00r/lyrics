[INTRO: Eminem]
Whoo! Shady! Aftermath!
(look at that bitch!)

[BRIDGE: Eminem]
There she goes, shakin that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losin control..

[VERSE 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk 
Get fuuuucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked, get sucked
Get wasted, shit-faceded, pasted, plastered
You drink, throw up, get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink throw up(ugh)
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine though, and still got a few chunks on that shoe string
Showin I was dehydrated, till the beat vibrated, I was revibed as soon as ? them hips and lick them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit..

[VERSE 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night at the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the motherfuckin mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust your ass, I'm gon continue to rock
Get your ass off the floor with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie..

[BRIDGE: Nate Dogg]
We bout to have a party
(turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(go ahead and shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
So once we get retarded
Some girls some guy invited
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, everyday she be givin it up..

[CHORUS: Nate Dogg]
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, aw girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me..

[VERSE 3: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Stick a little bit of this fluoride in it
Switch, but don't spit it, swallow and now finish
Yeeeaaah
Me and Nate D-O-Double G, lookin for a couple bitch-es with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple these, slip it in her bubbly
We fidna have to have a..

[BRIDGE: Nate Dogg]
We fidna have a party
(turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(go ahead and shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple-bottom jeans and a big ole sumptin
So once we get retarded (see, I told you)
Some girls some guy invited
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no..

[BRIDGE: Nate Dogg and Eminem]
(Nate)Now look at this lady all in front of me
Sexy as can be, tonight I want a SLUT
Would you be mine? Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine..
(Eminem)Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak, he said he wants a SLUT
Hope you don't mind, I told him how you like it from behind..

[CHORUS: Nate Dogg]
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, aw girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me..

[BRIDGE: Nate Dogg]

[OUTRO: Eminem]

You comin home with me!
And my boy! And his boy, and his boy!
