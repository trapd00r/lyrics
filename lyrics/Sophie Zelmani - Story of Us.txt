Is this me, is this you
The story of us in four letters of you
Four seasons of us, four seasons of you
Will end in the fourth letter to you

The story of me, the story of you

In everyone, I'll still be tied
I'm losing up with four goodbyes
One to cry, one to scream
One to ask, one will explain

The story of me, the story of you

Your duty now, four letters long
Then you're off and a story'll be done
Here we lived, here we were
Let's write the end with a lover's word
