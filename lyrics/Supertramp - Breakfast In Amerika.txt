Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
Never seem to get a lot

Take a Jumbo across the water
Like to see America
See the girls in California
I'm hoping it's going to come true
But there's not a lot I can do, hey

Could we have kippers for breakfast
Mummy dear, Mummy dear?
They gotta have 'em in Texas
'Cause everyone's a millionaire

I'm a winner, I'm a sinner
Do you want my autograph?
I'm a loser, what a joker
I'm playing my jokes upon you
While there's nothing better to do, hey

Don't you look at my girlfriend
(Girlfriend)
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
(Girlfriend)
Never seem to get a lot
(What you got? Not a lot)

Take a Jumbo across the water
Like to see America
See the girls in California
I'm hoping it's going to come true
But there's not a lot I can do, hey
