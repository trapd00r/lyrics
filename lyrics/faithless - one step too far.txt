You can sleep forever
But still you will be tired
You can stay as cold as stone
But still you won't find peace
With you I feel
I'm the meek leading the blind
With you I feel
I'm just spending wasted time

I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
And with you
It's always one step too far

You can work to the bone
But still you won't be full
You can look down on the world
But still you won't find love
You won't find love

Only with mellow are you thin enough to slide through
If the Sun or the Moon should give way to doubt
They would immediately go out
One swallow don't make a summer
But tomorrow has to start somewhere
