It's a Mustang Convertible summer night drive
Your country deejaying up my radio dial
Maybe it's the stars or the full moon sky
Making me crazy

You got your hand on my knee and you're drawing little hearts
Biting on your lip when that [?] song starts
Those blue and red lights been chasing us for miles
But they can wait baby

There ain't nothing 'bout your loving
That makes any sense if I had any left
I'd go running, but I love it
I can't even keep my eyes on the road
You're gonna be the death of me, death of me, I know
What a sweet, sweet way to go

We break in to the back door of the local motel
You push me on the bed and you whisper don't tell
Got me walking on a wire, wouldn't care if I fell
Don't want no one to save me
You're driving me crazy

There ain't nothing 'bout your loving
That makes any sense If I had any left
I'd go running, but I love it
I can't even keep my eyes on the road
You're gonna be the death of me, death of me

I know it's risky the way you get me felling like I'm bout to flatline
I just can't enough
Adrenaline rush
Makes me feel so alive

You're gonna the death of me, death of me, I know
Death of me, death of me
You're gonna be the death of me, death of me
You're driving me crazy

There ain't nothing 'bout your loving
That makes any sense If I had any left
I'd go running, but I love it
It's the thrill of spinning out of control
You're gonna be the death of me, death of me, I know
You're gonna be the death of me, death of me, I know
What a sweet, sweet way to go

Gonna be the death of me, death of me, I know
You're gonna be the death of me, death of me
