[Sam:]
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips.
You're trying hard not to show it
But baby, baby I know it

[Sam with Ryder:]
You've lost that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling,
You've lost that lovin' feeling,
Now it's gone...gone...gone...wooooooh.

[Sam:]
Now there's no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you.
And now you're starting to criticize little things I do.
It makes me just feel like crying
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dying

[Sam with Ryder and New Directions harmonizing:]
You lost that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling,
You've lost that lovin' feeling,
Now it's gone...gone...gone...woooooah

[Sam with Ryder:]
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday

[Sam:]
Oh, babe

[Ryder:]
Oh, baby

[Sam with Ryder:]
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away

[Sam:]
Baby ([Ryder:] Baby!)

[Sam with Ryder and New Directions:]
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone...gone...gone,
and I can't go on,

[Sam:]
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
