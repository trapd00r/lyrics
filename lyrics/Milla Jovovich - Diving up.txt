We're released

Like fireworks

Streaking out in great bright lines

Diving up

Into the sky

Reach out and crush us night

Receive us

Receive us with honor

-Breathe out here

We're released like fireworks-

Weeks go by unseen

They're feeding ghosts in the twilight

And you with your terrible sweet ways

And winding roads

Drop me headfirst into the trees

And see if I can't fall any higher

I hold a blade

Of one blade of grass

To your heart

I'll take off from the surface of the Water diving up

You're at the edge of my vision

A crazy missile

Glittering and silent

And it feels good rising up

And it feels like it's never gonna stop

I get fired

I just breathe out

I've been fired
