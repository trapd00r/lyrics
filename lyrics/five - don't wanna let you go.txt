Don't wanna let you go
We just wanna tell you
Just wanna let you know
That we'll stay around
So what else can you do
You've said all you have to
We're comin after you
So don't make a sound

I got this feelin'
Could it be there's someone watchin' over me
Tell me who you are
I close my eyes and count from nine
To try and find this peace of mind
But it's gone too far

You see our faces every time you turn your head around
We'll be watchin' even when you turn the lights down
We will always be around no matter where you are

(Chorus)

I'm all alone now in the dark
Just one chance just so we can talk
That is all I ask
I close my eyes and then I dream
I always wake up to a scream
Wonder where you are

Don't you know we're always gonna be around you
And there really isn't anything you can do
We will always be around no matter where you are

Don't wanna let you go
We just wanna tell you
Just wanna let you know
That we'll stay around
So what else can you do
You've said all you have to
We're comin after you
So don't make a sound (x2)
