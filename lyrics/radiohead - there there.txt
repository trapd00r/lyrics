In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches trip me as I speak
Just 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's there

There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

Just 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's there
(There's someone on your shoulder)
(There's someone on your shoulder)

Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there
(There's someone on your shoulder)
(There's someone on your shoulder)

There there!

Why so green and lonely?
And lonely
And lonely

Heaven sent you to me
To me
To me
To me

We are accidents
Waiting waiting to happen

We are accidents
Waiting waiting to happen
