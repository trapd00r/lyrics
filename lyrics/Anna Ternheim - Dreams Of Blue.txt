I'm having dreams of you
Dreams of you, dreams of you
They are dreams of blue
Dreams of blue, dreams of blue

Before the deep sea sleeps it all begins
The one moment you could still change everything
Before calling your name, seeing your face again
Before giving the note I just wrote
I'm waking up

These are my dreams of you
Dreams of you, dreams of you
They are dreams of blue
Dreams of blue, dreams of blue

What if I could stay
What if I could stay
What if I could stay
In this sleep for good

What if I could stay
What if I could stay
Stay in this sleep for good
