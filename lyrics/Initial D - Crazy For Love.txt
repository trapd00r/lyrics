Got to be the first one
Got to be the last one
You never get no peace of mind
Never show emotions
All communication's over, you
Got no feeling

Stop it now, guess you wonder why
You just sold out the dream inside
Up and down, baby for your lovin'
Baby we can fly up to the sky

Every day every night crazy for love
Into the dark of desire
Every time everywhere crazy for love
And now my spirit's on fire

When you get that feeling
When you find some lovin'
You've got to run away from here
Show me your emotion
Baby make me feel so natural
It's the real thing
