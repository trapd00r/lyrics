Money, fortune, and fame
Gotta have it is the name of the game
But it doesn't matter anyway,
It doesn't matter anyway...

Take is all or leave it behind
Keep it moving never know what I'll find
'Cause it doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway.

Yeahh!!

Woman, worry. Even you cant hold me!
Woman, worry, Even you cant hold me!

Moved up, taken a fall
Saw what happened when I lost it all
But it doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway...

Driving with no place to go
A new direction every time that the wind blows
Doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway.

Yeah!

Woman, worry. Even you cant hold me!
Woman, worry, Even you cant hold me!

Whatever happens, I'll be moving along
And I've gotta really learn to let go
Everything is gonna be alright
And its time that I needed to know
Letting it go, the weight of this world
Letting it go, 'cause gravity wont hold me no...

More!!!!

Woman, worry. Even you cant hold me!
Woman, worry, Even you cant hold me!
