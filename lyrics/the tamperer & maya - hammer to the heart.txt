I saw you in a picture that hung on the wall
 a sister told me you are the ball
 there was no attraction, but boy was I wrong
 now you're my baby line and my baby song
 ooh, you persistence
 blew up my resistence
 Boom boom boom, like a hammer to the heart
 just one look at you, and baby I was blown apart
 Boom boom boom, yeah I knew right from the start
 that this was something new, oh baby
 hammer to the heart
 Knew what you were doing, when you hit the spot
 sexual messiah, you know what you've got 
 take me to heaven, let's keep it hot
 show me the tricks that the devil forgot
 come on boy erotic
 make all night love narcotic
 Boom boom boom, like a hammer to the heart
 just one look at you, and baby I was blown apart
 Boom boom boom, yeah I knew right from the start
 that this was something new, oh baby
 Hammer to the heart
 Hammer to the heart
 Hammer to the heart
 Got a craving for my love narcotic
 send a message to my boy erotic
 now our love's exploding like a rocket
 Boom boom boom boom
 Boom boom boom, like a hammer to the heart
 just one look at you, and baby I was blown apart
 Boom boom boom, yeah I knew right from the start
 that this was something new, oh baby
 hammer to the heart...
