Called to Madonna 

o give me a line 

he said boy what have you done 

assing your time with a holy man 

alking about the moon and sun 

ut I can't tell the difference 

etween the fool and wise 

how me a river to follow 

way from all these lies 


've been on my own so long 

on't you lend me your hand 

've been picking up my bones too long 

on't you understand 


alled to the Captain 

o put me ashore 

or it looked like no man's land 

s this the way to follow 

 cried as I shook his hand 

e told me had no answer 

e didn't really hold the key 

 am a simple man 

as all he said to me 


've been on my own so long 

on't you lend me a hand 

've been out in the cold too long 

on't you understand 

've been on the road so long 

on't you lend me your hand 

've been out in the cold too long 

on't you understand 


eard my mother crying 

he was calling out my name 

hisper in the dark night 

aying who's to blame 

he hour glass keeps turning 

ith not enought sand to see 

 am a holy man 

o don't you bother me 


've been on my own so long 

on't you lend me your hand 

've been pickin' up my bones too long 

on't you understand 

've been on my own so long 

on't you lend me your hand 

've been out in the cold too long 

on't you understand?
