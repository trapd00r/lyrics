We had a cat called Dionysus
Everyday another crisis
I used to keep him in my box
Where I kept my toys and blocks

He hated me
But I loved him

Whenever Dionysus saw me
He would arch his back and hiss and claw me
As soon as he could, he got loose
Across the roofs of Syracuse

Away from me
But I loved him

Meows

I kept him in the little chest
Where I was keeping all the rest

He hated me
Cause I loved him
