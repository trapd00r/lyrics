This is a start
that I know I'll believe in
so I'm leavin' everything behind
Keeping the parts
that I know I'll be needing
and I breed to be a better kind
And I'm leavin' everyone behind
This is the age
when my past should be gone
but it's just stronger than the aims I have Turning the pages
I used to hang on to
I was young and I have changed my mind
And I'm leaving everything behind
New beginning again
a bit closer
new beginning again
a little bit closer
New beginning again
a bit closer to the end
This is the time
it's a delicate line
to the beginning of what's yet to come
Lifetimes of changes
a strange generation
explanations never come in time
So I'm leavin' everything behind
