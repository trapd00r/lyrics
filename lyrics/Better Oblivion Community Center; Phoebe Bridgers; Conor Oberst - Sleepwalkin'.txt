[Intro]
Like, it's, it's impossible to count
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Conor Oberst]
Drinking cold, black coffee
I shake and shake, still won't get off me
Another blissed out fantasy
Where animals and objects talk to me
Always try and hate it
But then you laugh, it sounds outrageous
Spend another day sleepwalking

[Chorus 1: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
Is this having fun?
Or is it just because?
Which one is jumping first
Off of the face of the earth?

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
You like beer and chocolate
I like setting off those bottle rockets
We can never compromise
But fighting 'til the death keeps us alive
Why don't you stay
If you're going to leave your car here anyway?
Spend another summer shit-talking

[Chorus 2: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
Is this having fun?
It's not like the way it was
I thought that you loved this stuff
Or did I make that up?

[Outro: Conor Oberst & Phoebe Bridgers]
Acting insane, playing it safe
I wasn't sold on that plan anyways
Feeling afraid of making a change
Hoping to last another day
I want them to stop, the circular thoughts
Spinning a whirlpool of forget-me-nots
I gave what I got, it came as a shock
To find out I'm fine with what I've lost
