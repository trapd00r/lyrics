She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one

They're saying
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
(And she'll say to him)

She's saying
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
Ooh-ooh

She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind
All her friends, they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's saying
Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and
Push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
(What a pleasant dream)

Just saying
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
