Get free, yeah!
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now {x2} 
(Come on and get rowdy now)

Once again I don't follow trends
They just follow me just like the Israelites through the Red Sea
It might take U some time but U will learn 2 see
The undisputed truth and get free

CHORUS:
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now {x4} 
(Hear me, feel me, love me) {x3}
(Come on) {x2} (Good God)
(Once again, back, it's the incredible)

At the very core of thinking I originate
That's why U'll never know my thinking or my fate
Invisible - unless of course U are my mate
If not, U think U see me I disintegrate
I disintegrate my thoughts from yours
U can feel me comin' outta every one of your pores 
Reintegrating where I am understood and adored
"U're just my subject - that's why U're outta touch"
Say what's this claim - out of what?
My dear I am the touch!

(Ooh hear me, feel me) {x2} 
(Come on and feel it)
(Come on)
(NPG get funky)
(Love me, now)
(NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now)

I can give U power (Power) or I can take it away
I can make U dance cuz this guitar I play 
Heavy rotation never made my world go round (Come on {x2})
Commercialization, commercialization of the music (Huh) is what brought it down
(Oh hell) (2 the bridge)

My level is now what U must learn 2 rise above
Talk 2 D'Angelo or better yet ?uestlove
It might take (y'all) U some time, but U will learn 2 see 
The undisputed truth and get free

CHORUS {x2}

(The freak)
(Bass)
(Where that girl at?)
(Ooh) 

Funky, NPG New Power (Chuck) Generation (D.) free nation, free nation (Funky, funky, funky) 
Check it (Undisputed)
Come one, come all 2 the download ball, uh
There's no curfew 2 hurt U, no substitution
School's now in session
Put down the Smith & Wessons
Real renegades don't invite grenades 2 make the grade
This is a brain raid - who rise above the lies
Raised above the daze
New ways disguised in a craze
Uh, gotcha back against that status they be throwin' up at us
Back against the wall again high trees catchin' a lotta wind, ohhh
Last band standin'
Gotta knack for overstandin' (Come on and get rowdy now)
Accordin' 2 plan and look up in the sky
No cable wire, whoa (NPG, get rowdy)
God bless the child {x2}
So funky
(Bass)
Ha ha ha...
