You know I 
Can’t stand here quietly watching this 
My heart shrinks and I want you near 
You know I 
Never gave you anything but my love 
But now you’re gone 
My mind is up and feeling 

The purest skin and eyes that feel 
Just what I need 
A place under the sun 
And every night that I can’t sleep 
I’m drifting to 
A place under the sun 

I wonder why 
Every day just passes me by 
And I’m flying beyond (she’s flying beyond) 
Wrap me up in your colors 
And don’t let me show it all too soon 
I’ll save some for: 

Some quiet nights of quiet stars 
All words fall out 
A place under the sun 
All that you touch and what you are 
The choice of time 
A place under the sun
