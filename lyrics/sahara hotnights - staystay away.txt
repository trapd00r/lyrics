I never tire I never stop
I'll never leave for anything, anyone else
You knock me out you shake me up
I stay for more I'll never turn you down like before

A million nights in my silent room
I wanna learn all the right words I never knew
The saddest thing I put you through 
I got to hold you soon I'm asking you

(Stay, stay away)
I can only do what I'm told
(Should I stay or stay away)
If you say so I'll leave you alone
(Should I stay or stay away)
Breaks my heart when you tell me to go

I'll stand on every corner around you
I will always be right behind you
Never give up trying to be on your mind
where I belong

I never shut I never close
I never dream of anywhere anyone else
I see the sign hanging on your door
It tells me why I can never come asking for more

I'll stand on every corner around you
I will always be right behind you
Never give up trying to be on your mind
where I belong
I'll walk through every door till I find you
Searching every street cos' I'm bound to
keep on trying, always remind you
where I belong
