Been had to get forget, lived in the sickest pad
Slept with mice and roaches, woke up pissed up slab
School of the hard knocks, I on the vicious ave
Jim chase Mark Chan, we beat a bitches ass

Ask me who you loving, Cam, you been bugging
Must have lost your mind, you fought Lucien's cousin
And St. Mark's, yeah, big LE watch
My nigga red squashed it, forget that topic

40th, down the block danger zone
Up the ave forty wall, hope y'all niggas bring you chrome
What you saying homes? Cops, they raiding homes
Activator juice, yes, to spray your dome

From a tiny dude, developed grimey dude
Stuck delivery, took all his Chinese food
I'm so good but bad, I'm so kind but rude
Americas most wanted, should have signed a Q

Plus its savage, cop car crash your door
Further more heard the boy 'em at the sack amore
Boy yes, overseas, more sex
4 jets, corvettes and I ain't done a tour yet

'Cause I'm moving bricks, yes, they serve in fours
Signing off dipset boss, truly yours

We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all
We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all
We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it
We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it

We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all
We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all
We gon' get it, get it, we gon' get it, get it
We gon' get it, get it, we gon' get it, get it

My cerebral stress, eagle let it rest
Feel it in the air, yeah, Siegel said it best
It's a legal mess, needles need to death
Blame the government until then I need to chef

Turn right, lead left, street games scrams
Call the cops, oc, like we need a ref
You can't cheat a chef, I can see your chest
No heart, cherish your oxygen, breath your breaths

He need a rest, how he gon' be the best?
Like I guess a couple slugs he need to catch
See the sketch, you lassie
The gun is Frisbee proceed to fetch

Side up the hoopty, spray up the Sentra
Be sixty years before I'm laid up in benter
Sprayed up her denture, your girl
Then I laid her placenta, blew hazed in her rental

Some days in December, some days I remember
A boy, Sugar Ray wanna play the contender
Just say I got a temper
And my temperature is off the thermometer

Korean New Year to Hanukah, I'm bombing ya
Put you to sleep for good pajama, ya
Wrangle you in ya He-Man pajamas
Wrap you up in your Pac Man sheets

We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all
We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all
We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it
We gon' get it, get it, money we gon' get it, get it

We gon' make it, make it, we gon' make it y'all
We gon' make it, make it, we gon' take it y'all
We gon' get it, get it, we gon' get it, get it
We gon' get it, get it, we gon' get it, get it
