Dad, oh don't get up, I beg you to sit tight 
Sweet girl, I'll be a ghost girl , forget it I am fine 

If anything a witnessing is all I needed that night 

Until I get what I'm to get 
you'll keep being compelled to flee 
Until I out this false story 
you'll keep playing "the guy who leaves" 

Brother, oh, brother , solo you did bust out 
All I knew was you didn't invite me, so begins themes of self-doubt 

There is nothing as harrowing as how I translate backs 

Until I get what I'm to get 
you'll keep being compelled to flee 
Until I out this false story 
you'll keep playing "the guy who leaves" 

Baby, oh partner, how well you've played this part 
Similar, oh how familiar, reluctant truth you impart 

And how you serve necessity: â€œrepeat 'til she sees light" 

Until I get what I'm to get 
you'll keep being compelled to flee 
Until I out this false story 
you'll keep playing "the guy who leaves".
