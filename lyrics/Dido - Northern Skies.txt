I have returned to northern skies
Where summer hasn't touched
The clouds that pass above

I have returned to the sombre greys
Of days too early to come
And too hurried to stay

I have left a million stars
And an ocean light and clearly blue

I have left the warmth of the sun
And a million adventures
Not yet begun

For once there was beauty here for me
Under the wide northern skies
And once there was magic here for me
Under the wide northern skies

I saw trees as green
And this dark as blue
Heartbreak and poetry
With deeper roots

But now I know
This is lonely country
And it leads me only back to the sea

For once there was beauty here for me
Under the wide northern skies
And once there was magic here for me
Under the wide northern skies

I have returned to northern skies
Where summer hasn't touched
The clouds that pass above

I have returned to the sombre greys
Of days too early to come
And too hurried to stay

For once there was beauty here for me
Under the wide northern skies
And once there was magic here for me
Under the wide northern skies

And once there was beauty here for me
Under the wide northern skies
And once there was magic here for me
Under the wide northern skies
