Today I killed, he was just a boy
Eight before him, I knew them all
In the fields a dying oath
I'd kill them all to save my own

Cut me free, bleed with me, oh no
One by one, we will fall, down down
Pull the plug, end the pain, run an' fight for life
Hold on tight, this ain't my fight

Deliver me from this war
It's not for me it's because of you
Devil's instant; my eternity
Obey to kill to save yourself

Cut me free, bleed with me, oh no
One by one, we will fall, down down
Pull the plug, end the pain, run an' fight for life
Hold on tight, this ain't my fight

"I envy the 9 lives that gave me hell
My path made up by their torn bodies
Man to man, soldier to soldier, dust to dust
Call me a coward but I can't take it anymore"

They wait for me far back home
The live with eyes turned away
They were the first ones to see
They are the last ones to bleed

"The ultimate high as all beautiful dies
A ruler's tool, a priest's excuse, a tyrant's delight
I alone, the great white hunter
I'll march till the dawn brings me rest

Tenth patriot at the gallows' pole!"

Cut me free, bleed with me, oh no
One by one, we will fall, down down
Pull the plug, end the pain, run an' fight for life
Hold on tight, this ain't my fight

Cut me free, bleed with me, oh no
One by one, we will fall, down down
Pull the plug, end the pain, run an' fight for life
Hold on tight, this ain't my fight
