Hey, man, wake up and smell the concrete
Strange to see you've change like the LB 
Could be identity crisis, but I can't buy this
Reality bites but that's what life is
Pitiful you, your hideous behavior
Hate what God gave ya, fakin' all the flava
Artificial minds seekin' out the new trends
Get in where you fit in, quit thinkin' like a has-been
Diggin' in my culture let me let your punks know
I'm an old school soldier with the funk flow
A damn shame you wanna change yourself because you're sick of yourself

Well, I'm sick of you too! 
Fake
You're a counterfeit,
Fake, you know we figured you out
Well, I'm sick of you, too! 
Fake
You're a counterfeit 
Fake!

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what it's like to be a clone
Doin' nothin', nothin' on my own 
Alone in your misery, you're bitin' on my new style
Filed as a counterfeit, going down in history
As nothin' but a copy cat (Copy cat)
So if your fakin' that you're phat
You need a ball bat right where your head is at
All your desperation causes separation
Now I grab the mic to intimidate
Your weakness screams from the limp on your siren
Phonies get the hint quick smacked with funk flick
Pain for the fakers fame can't maintain because you're sick of yourself 

Well, I'm sick of you too! 
Fake
You're a counterfeit,
Fake, you know we figured you out
Well, I'm sick of you, too! 
Fake
You're a counterfeit 
Fake!

All these phonies

You disregarded your life (Disregarded your life)
You disrespected your friends (You disrespected your friends)
You've even stolen your appearance (Stolen)
From hangin' out with my family
But I should have never dropped my guard (Shoulda never dropped my guard)
So you could stab me in the back (Stab me in the back)
But you were faking me out (You were faking me out)
Just faking me out, you wear a mask (You wear a mask)
Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit,
You're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit,
You're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit!
Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit,
You're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit!
Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit,
You're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit!
Freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit,
You're freaking me out you wear a mask called counterfeit!!

Now you're steadily startin' to change 
You wanna re-arrange your lifestyle, live like the wild child
With the vibe alive you could lie to try and be so fly
A lie, but you deny 
You're a fa-a-a-a-a-a-a-ke!
You know we figured you're a phony 
you know we figured you out 
Fa-a-a-a-a-a-a-ke!
You know we figured you out, figured you out,
Figured you out fake 

Fake!

Freaking me out, you're probably freaking me out (Fake!)
Freaking me out, you're probably freaking me out (Fake!)

Fa-a-a-a-a-a-a-ke!
