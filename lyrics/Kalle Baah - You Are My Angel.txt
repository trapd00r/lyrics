You are my angel and you light up
You are the queen in all the race
You are my angel and you light up
You are the queen in all the race

Me no bad bad one all of the time
Me no sad sad one when I drink up the wine
I gonna dress me up, go looking for fun
I gonna change my name to Don Juan
Me no shilly shally, I know what I want
Me no shilly shally, I know what I need
Me no shilly shally, I know what to say
Me no shilly shally, I'm gonna take you away

You are my angel and you light up
You are the queen in all the race
You are my angel and you light up
You are the queen in all the race

I gonna ring your bell and ask for a date
I gonna run like hell not to be late
I gonna swing your legs up in the sky
I gonna strip off your clothes and give you a try
Now I'm ringing your bell and you want me to tell
To Come out for a ride, I'm your midnight guide
We gonna find some place under the sun
And run a bed race till the morning come

You are my angel and you light up
You are the queen in all the race
You are my angel and you light up
You are the queen in all the race

Angel sugar in a Friday night, In a Saturday night
In all long nights, you are my sexy daughter
Sexy, sexy barbie doll
