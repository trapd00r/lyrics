I used to think that when this was all over
You might feel different 'bout me
Yeah I always knew, one of these days you'd come around
Now I wonder if dreams are just dreams

Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I'm having trouble
Letting you go
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I'm having trouble
Letting you go

Baby look out your window
It's raining on your summer home
You by the fire keeping warm and dry
There's no one as honest as those in pain
Oh honey can you see me?
Will you let me inside?

Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I'm having trouble
Letting you go

Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I 'm having trouble
Letting you go

It's a restless world, uncertain times
You said hope was getting hard to find
But time rolls on, days roll by
What about the broken ones?
What about the lonely ones?
Oh honey I'm having trouble letting you go

It's off in the distance somewhere up the road
There's some easy answer for the tears you've cried
And it makes me uneasy, makes me feel different
Do you get scared when you close your eyes?

Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I'm having trouble
Letting you go
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh
I'm having trouble
Letting you go
