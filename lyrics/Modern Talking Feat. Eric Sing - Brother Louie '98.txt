Check it out, check it out, here we go, let me say it
Tax on wax make the DJ's wanna play it
The front to the front, and the back to the back
And the hip to the hop, and the rhyme to the rap
Every single line on time you admire
Stays in your brain like earth, wind and fire
Here I am all the time, girl, you know me
I must admitt, I'm the real brother Louie

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it, Louie
'Cause I'm a lover

Let me kiss your lips, I'm intrigued by the taste
The way you dance, the way you move your waist
We meet face to face in a crowded place
Let me take you home, let's cut the chase
To every man that's two-size - what do you choose?
If you choose my love, that means you never lose
Never have the chance to be there for you
Listen to the words of brother Lou

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it, Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So leave it, Louie
'Cause I'm a lover

Everybody in the house come on!

You're no good, can't you see
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
You say it!
I'm in love, set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me

Come on!
Only love breaks her heart

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
You say it!
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Come on!
