I want you so bad

First I saw your gorgeous eyes
Then noticed your ass was fly
I just thought we could have fun
I could show you affection

I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad
I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you

I will make your life complete
Just sit back and have a seat
Let my lips just touch your lips
Then I'll move down to your hips

I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad
I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad

Check, check it out girl
Don't waste time
Check, check it out girl
You're too damn fine
Check, check it out girl
Just let go
Check, check it out girl
Let it flow

I can show you who's the man
Let me show you with my hands
I just want you close to me
I'll get you wet
Just wait and see

I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad
I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad

I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad
I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad

Touching and kissing and licking you right
Never letting go
Touching and kissing and licking you right
Never letting go

Check, check it out girl
Don't waste time
Check, check it out girl
You're too damn fine
Check, check it out girl
Just let go
Check, check it out girl
Let it flow

I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad
I want you so bad girl
I want you I need you so bad
