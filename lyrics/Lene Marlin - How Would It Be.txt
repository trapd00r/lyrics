What have I done?
What if it's too late now?
Did I do all I could, did I?
Did I make it all good, did I?

Somehow it doesn't feel right
Is it really all over?
Did I think it through, did I?
What if all I want is you?

And now
I won't see you again
The moment was there, but we lost it
Time changed it all and we let it
We let it happen
And now
I wonder how it would be
If things stayed the same, and we liked it
The end of a search, 'cause we found it
How would it be?
How would it be?
How would it be?
How would it be?

What have we done?
What if it's too late now?
Was it always like this, was it?
Was it something we missed, was it?

Somehow it doesn't feel right
Is it really all over?
Was it all it could be, was it?
Did I give you the best of me?

And now
I won't see you again
The moment was there, but we lost it
Time changed it all and we let it
We let it happen
And now
I wonder how it would be
If things stayed the same, and we liked it
The end of a search, 'cause we found it
How would it be?
How would it be?
How would it be?
How would it be?

And now
I won't see you again
The moment was there, but we lost it
Time changed it all and we let it
We let it happen
And now
I wonder how it would be
If things stayed the same, and we liked it
The end of a search, 'cause we found it

And now
I won't see you again
The moment was there, but we lost it
Time changed it all and we let it
We let it happen
And now
I wonder how it would be
If things stayed the same, and we liked it
The end of a search, 'cause we found it
How would it be
