Last summer was mad, remember the rain
I know people complain, I had something else in mind
Not the sound of rain against my windowpane
All I could hear, was you hammering in my head

Fall like a wave, against a rock
Leave with a rash, or get crushed
You never know, until after the shock
When you wake up, what's broken, what's not

One day, I don't know how, my whole life evolved
Around you my lord, believing was not enough
You said I was a hole of desperate need
And no love in the world, not ever yours, could satisfy me
That's when the troubles began, disasters came
One by one, I nearly drowned in that summer rain

Fall like a wave, against a rock
Leave with a rash, or get crushed
You never know, until after the shock
When you wake up, what's broken, what's not

We fall like waves, agaisnt a rock
Leave with a rash, or get crushed
You never know, until after the shock
When you wake up, what's broken, what's not
When you wake up, what's broken, what's not
