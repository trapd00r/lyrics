You can take back all your secrets
We'll divide up all the lies
Keep all the pictures in their frames
Cut me out, yeah, I'll be fine
Tell the neighbors all my feelings
Go on and give away my pride
It's hard to laugh and cry, live and die, every night

Keep your Rolodex of friends
And all the remnants can be mine
I guess there'll be no happy endings
When "once upon" is doing time
There's a different kind of meaning now
To livin' on a prayer
Some don't seem to notice
And the rest don't seem to care

I tell myself I (feel no pain)
But I'm feeling the pain (walk away)
Can't walk away
I'm hanging on the ropes of hope
It's getting hard to cope you know
When you're the needle running through my veins
I've changed my name to Novocaine

You put my favorite belongings in a box in the garage (let's get this straight)
Burned my favorite sweats from high school
Tried to sell my muscle car (that's not okay)
Your mother's gonna visit for a couple months this year
They say you do the crime, do the time, it's all so clear

I tell myself I (feel no pain)
But I'm feeling the pain (walk away)
Can't walk away
I'm hanging on the ropes of hope
It's getting hard to cope you know
When you're the needle that's running through my veins
I've changed my name to Novocaine (feel no pain)
Novocaine

Well things ain't what they used to be
It's a sleepless, self-help century
Man, I'm up to here with Dr. Phil and the modern man in me

I tell myself to feel no pain
But I'm feeling the pain (walk away)
Can't walk away
I'm hanging on the ropes of hope
It's getting hard to cope you know
When you're the needle that's running through my veins
I've changed my name to Novocaine (feel no pain)
Novocaine
Novocaine (feel no pain)
Novocaine
I feel no pain

spoken:
It's okay, you're a 21st century man
This is a 21st century land
You gotta get in touch with your inner-self
The feminine side
That's all they really wanted, right?
I understand
Maybe what I gotta do is understand
I... who she... I don't... I never understood anything to begin with
