Well, I'm a sweet smelling, truth telling, city dwelling kind of a woman
Looking for a slow walking, sweet talking, hungry kind of a man
Well, I'm a wine drinking, fast thinking, eye winking kind of a woman
Just a-looking for a cool headed, un-wedded serious kind of a man

Well, I'm no man's lady if you're no lady's man
So come and get me, baby, if you can, oh yeah, if you can

I'm an ice breaking, painstaking, merry making kind of a woman, yeah
Looking for a big-hearted, uncharted, vulnerable kind of a man, yeah, I am
Well, I'm an eye-catching, back scratching, door-latching kind of a woman
Just a-looking for a love craving, cool-shaving, curious kind of a man

Well, I'm no man's lady if you're no lady's man
So come and get me baby, if you can, oh yeah, if you can

Well, I don't want a knight in armor who would be untrue
Or a rich old man who needs love too
No juvenile delinquent trying to learn what to do
Just need a good man to carry me through

I'm a hard busted, long lusted, maladjusted kind of a woman
Looking for a good looking, slow cooking, powerful kind of a man
Said I'm a big eyed, soft eyed, qualified kind of a woman
Looking for a hard riding, time binding, animal kind of a man

Well, I'm no man's lady if you're no lady's man
So come and get me baby, if you can, oh yeah, if you can
