I heard you calling, I don't know when
Was something from nothing, but it's all the same
And if Saturn's coming, it's right on time
And you're what's left when I'm losing my mind

So, I follow you slowly, holding my breath
I don't care what happens, what happens next
But if you know of something, it's right on time
And you're what's left when I'm losing my mind

There's an open doorway to where I wanna be
And I let the world in and it's closing on me
And if I tell you only, would you ever believe?
If I'm the one calling, are you answering?

I wanna see this through
I wanna know it's you
And if you're coming home, it's right on time
And you're what's left when I'm losing my mind
And you're what's left, I'm losing my mind
And you're what's left, I'm losing my mind
