Remember when you took my love
Said I wasn't good enough
That I never seemed to have the time (time)
You were always halfway in
I didn't even meet your friends
But you were always talking sh.. 'bout mine

And one thing led to another
'Cause we'd be fighting for days
I used to think that I loved you
But now it's all been erased
We drifted further and further
I didn't want to let go
But I know, I know, I know

I ain't missing you at all
I don't need no medicine (oh oh)
I'm better than I've ever been (oh oh)
I'm better than
I ain't missing you at all
I don't need no medicine (oh oh)
I'm better than I've ever been (oh oh)
I'm better than
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you

Don't say that you want me back
I ain't ever going back to that
Never knew that freedom felt so good
I threw out all your clothes
Parties after every show
Doing things that I never thought I would

And one thing led to another
'Cause we'd been fighting for days
I used to think that I loved you
But now it's all been erased
We drifted further and further
I didn't want to let go
But I know, I know, I know

I ain't missing you at all
I don't need no medicine (oh oh)
I'm better than I've ever been (oh oh)
I'm better than
I ain't missing you at all
I don't need no medicine (oh oh)
I'm better than I've ever been (oh oh)
I'm better than
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you

Bet you thought I'd come back again
But girl, I'm doing just fine
You ain't been playing on my mind
I bet you thought that I needed a friend
But why would I pretend?

I ain't missing you at all
I don't need no medicine (oh oh)
I'm better than I've ever been (oh oh)
I'm better than
I ain't missing you at all
I don't need no medicine (oh oh)
I'm better than I've ever been (oh oh)
I'm better than
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you at all
I ain't missing you
