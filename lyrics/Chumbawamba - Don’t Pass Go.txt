Didn't he know it was a waste of time
All stitched up by a thin blue line
Didn't he know it was a waste of time
All stitched up by a thin blue line

Well, the facts said yes
But the judge said no
Go straight to jail and don't pass go
He didn't understand
And he told them so
Go straight to jail and don't pass go
Don't pass go

There ain't no justice, just us
There ain't no justice, just us

Didn't he know it was a waste of time
All stitched up by a thin blue line

A little self-protection
They don't want to know
Go straight to jail and don't pass go
And he won't say sorry
Play the old Jim Crow
Go straight to jail and don't pass go
Don't pass go

Didn't he know it was a waste of time
All stitched up by a thin blue line

White paranoia
It runs the show
Go straight to jail and don't pass go
You want table manners
You get rule of law
Go straight to jail and don't pass go
Don't pass go

Didn't he know it was a waste of time
All stitched up by a thin blue line
Don't pass go
Didn't he know it was a waste of time
All stitched up by a thin blue line
Don't pass go
Didn't he know it was a waste of time
All stitched up by a thin blue line
Don't pass go
