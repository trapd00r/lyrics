Don't stop moving to that funky, funky beat
Don't stop moving to that funky, funky beat (yeah, c'mon)

Bradley:
DJ got the party started, there's no end in sight
Everybody's moving to the rhythm that's inside
It's a crazy world, but tonight's the right situation
Don't get left behind

I can feel the music moving through me everywhere
Ain't no destination, baby we don't even care
There's a place to be if you need the right education
Let it take you there

Jo:
And just go with the magic baby
I can see it there in your eyes (Bradley: I can see it there in your eyes) 
Let it flow, stop the waiting
Right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go

All:
Don't stop movin'
Can you feel the music?
DJ's got us going around, 'round
Don't stop movin'
Find your own way to it
Listen to the music
Taking you to places that you've never been before
Baby now

Don't stop moving to that funky, funky beat (oh)
Don't stop moving to the S Club beat (yeah yeah yeah)

Bradley:
You can touch the moment, almost feel it in the air
Don't know where we're goin', baby we don't even care
Ain't no mystery, just use your imagination
Let it take you there

Jo:
And just go with the magic baby
I can see it there in your eyes (Bradley: I can see it there in your eyes)
Let it flow, stop the waiting
Right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go

All:
Don't stop moving
Can you feel the music?
DJ's got us going around, 'round (don't stop movin')
Don't stop moving
Find your own way to it
Listen to the music
Taking you to places that you've never been before

Don't stop moving to that funky, funky beat (don't stop movin')
Don't stop moving to the S Club beat

Jo:
Forget about your fears tonight
Listen to your heart
Let's just touch the sky (Bradley: listen to your heart)
No need to reason why
Just listen to the sound
Let it make you come alive
