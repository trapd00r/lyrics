They say everything can be replaced
They say ev'ry distance is not near
Yet I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining 
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Well yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
Yet all day long I hear him shouting so loud
Heâ€™s crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
