Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, 
Didn't you?
People call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall."
You thought they were all 
A-kiddin' you.

You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging 
Your next meal.

How does it feel?
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely,
But you know you only used to get 
Juiced in it.
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
And now you're gonna have to get 
Used to it.

You say you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis,
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Do you want to 
Make a deal?"

How does it feel?
How does it feel,
To be on your own,
With no direction home,
A complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did 
Tricks for you.
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You shouldn't let other people get your 
Kicks for you.

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at,
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel,
To have you on your own,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they 
Got it made.
Exchanging all precious gifts, but you'd better 
Take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
When you ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets 
To conceal.

How does it feel?
Ah, how does it feel,
To be on your own,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?
