I′ve got a couple more years on you babe and that's all
I′ve had more chances to fly and more places to fall
It's not that I'm wiser, it′s just that I′ve spentMore time with my back to the wall and I've picked up
A couple a more years on you babe and that′s all

Now I've walked a couple more roads than you babe and that′s all
And I'm tired of running while you′re only learning to crawl
And you're going somewhere but I've been to somewhere
And found it was nowhere at all and I picked up
A couple more years on you babe and that′s all

Sayin′, "Goodbye girl don't ever come easy at all"
But you got to fly cause you′re hearin' them young eagles call
Someday when you′re older, you'll smile at a man strong and told
And say I got a couple more years on you babe, that′s all

You'll say, "I've got a couple more years on you babe and that′s all"
I′ve had more chances to fly and more places to fall
It's not that I′m wiser, it's just that I′ve spent
More time with my back to the wall and I've picked up
A couple a more years on you babe and that′s all
