No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit!

No no limits, we'll reach for the sky!
No valley to deep
No mountain too high
No no limits, won't give up the fight!
We do what we want and we do it with pride

Lemme hear ya say yeah! (yeah!)

Hard to the core, I feel the floor
When I'm on stage, yo, ya answer more
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge, I work real hard to collect my cash!
Tick tick ticka tick take your time, when I'm goin' I'm goin' for mine
Open your ears and you will hear it
I tell you this 'cause there's no limit!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit!

No no limits, we'll reach for the sky!
No valley to deep
No mountain too high
No no limits, won't give up the fight!
We do what we want and we do it with pride

Ow! Hey yay yeah hey hey! Now, now, hey yeah yeah hey hey! Hoo!

No limits allowed
Cause there's much crowd
Microphone check as I choose my route
I'm playing on the road
I've got no fear, the south from my mouth is on record here
No valley too deep no mountain too high
Reach the top, touch the sky!
They tried to diss me 'cause I sell out
I'm making techno and I am proud!

No no limits, we'll reach for the sky!
No valley to deep
No mountain too high
No no limits, won't give up the fight!
We do what we want and we do it with pride
