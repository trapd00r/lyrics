[Gil Scott-Heron:]
You will not be able to stay home brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on scag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

[King Green:]
This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

[Royce Da 5'9":]
Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing
Oh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin', ah

I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggas my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinatin'
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns, and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar is firing
Oh, we in the war, where butterflies keep dyin', ah

[King Green:]
This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Here take your number one, quit
Number one soul, get your number one chip
Number one fly with your number one kicks
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

[Royce Da 5'9":]
Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do? Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you gas you up
And tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to what we're retracting to
I do what I want to do, they do what I let them do
Everything niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie
There is nothing I can say to you that is good
Remember when you raisin' the butterfly
Don't you ever fucking disrespect the caterpillar

[King Green:]
This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Now you think that you number one, quit
Number one soul, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kicks
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

[Logic:]
Yeah, sold a quarter million records in my first week
And BET still don't wanna let me perform
Maybe it's 'cause my pigment, maybe I'm being ignant
Maybe it's all a figment of my imagination
And exaggeration, exacerbates that I'm the biggest, yes
How many are willing to kill us, we the realest, that's why they feel us the best
But I don't give a fuck about this rap shit, not really though
Shittin' on a brother I should love, man, that's silly, yo
Fuck all this division and lyrical incision
It's time to unify 'cause hip-hop is beautiful, it's you and I
And it doesn't discriminate if you black or white and Christian or Muslim
It just love 'em and put nothin' above 'em
I just want to be remembered as a good person
Dispersin' a message of hope while the whole world worsens
And the media will still find a way to turn us into clickbait and misquote
Wanna keep the peace, but if you do that, I'ma slit throats
Sike nah, "Logic's such a hypocite"
You can take a hike, nah, right now
Are we here to talk about suicide, depression, anxiety, mental health and all that shit you scared to mention
Yeah, I could talk about the millions I've amassed
But now just ain't the time or place
It's crazy how everyone so obsessed with my race
'Cause I'm proud to be black, but matter of fact
If it was flipped around and somebody asked me
What it was like to be a white rapper
"What's it like to be a white rapper, Logic?"
Oh and I was just like, just never talked about it like
"Man, it's just so great being a white rapper
White white white, white everything
White, man, being white's so great
Wow it's so great."
And then some brother was like "Ayy, ain't yo daddy black?"
And I was like "Oh shit"
And the whole world be like "What, are you scared to be black? Are you ashamed to be black?! Motherfucker, fuck you!
Fuck you, you piece of shit. Mixed, biracial, fucking cunt"
(That's how they be)
Cole said fuck all this black and white, it's time to unite
Be who you are, identify as a star
Fuck all the jewelry and money inside of yo car
You still just a person and I'm still dispersin' these lyrics
Fuck the rap ego shit
Just be a good person, now that's the spirit
Shoutout to true emcees that love the culture
From Duckworth to Chano, Jermaine and Joey
Aubrey and can't forget Bobby
To every emcee who knows that this is truly a way of life
And not just a hobby, uh not just a hobby, uh
Not just a hobby, this is a way of life
Shout out to Bobby, the L-O-G-I-C, this shit a way of life
This shit a way of life, yeah
