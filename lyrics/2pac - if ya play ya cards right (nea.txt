Wassup boo? Yeah
Yeah

Another shady mission, tricks
Like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfied and today we stole them kisses

Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding it definitely, if they plan for me
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga

Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein' here ain't livin'

Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you playa cardz right

I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on who
Who'll be the one who'll be there through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will, be there till the morning
We won't leave until the night and we will be forevermore

No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside
And it's gonna be alright, it'll be okay

If we try and take our time
Yes, baby, take our time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one who

I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on who
Who'll be the one who'll be there through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will, be there till the morning
We won't leave until the night and we will be forevermore

You got to playa cardz right on one
Can't be rushing like it's a race 'nahmsayin?
If you be patient, and you take your time
And you finess it, 9 times out of 10 times

Homeboy you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush and you just be manhandling
Yo ass is goin' home tonight
Playa cardz right nigga, take ya time, be patient

Go slow, it's better that way
You ain't heard? Playa cardz right

I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on who
Who'll be the one who'll be there through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will, be there till the morning
We won't leave until the night and we will be forevermore

Take your time man, don't be in such a rush
You got to be patient man, be patient
It ain't going nowhere one, get some champagne
Bring some roses or something you know?

Play some soft shit, light a fire
You got to be cool with it
You got to be slow with it
Got to be patient

You got to play your cards right on one
You can't be rushing like it's a race 'nahmsayin?
If you be patient and you take your time
