I was slipping through the cracks of a stolen jewel
I was tightrope walking in two ton shoes
and now somebody's talking a third world war
(I've been caught in a mind riot)
and the police said this is normal control
(I've been caught in a mind riot)
and the candles burning yesterday
like somebody's best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot
mind riot
I was crying from my eyeteeth and bleeding from my soul
and I sharpened my wits on a dead man's skull
I built an elevator from his bones
(I've been caught in a mind riot)
and I climbed to the top floor to stamp out the coals
(I've been caught in a mind riot)
candles burning yesterday
like somebody's best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot
I'm tied within 
candles burning yesterday
like somebodies best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot
I'm tied within
My luck's last match struck
in the pouring down wind
pouring down wind
pouring down wind
mind riot
mind riot
mind riot
mind riot
