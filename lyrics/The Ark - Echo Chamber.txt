No
Have you heard the word no, no, no?
I thought so
'cos everybody says yes
everywhere you go

You know
If you always must know what's right
you will end up
You will end up among the ones
who always are wrong

Remember a star that shone so bright
but now his glare fills me with fright
And now I actually fear
that something's gone wrong with your ears
I'm singing

Step out, step out of your echo chamber
Step out, step out of your echo chamber
Before it is too late (late)
Before it is too late (late)
Before it is too late
'cos I miss you so

(Echo, echo, echo, echo)

You
You always stayed among the ones
Not so strong
Too eager to belong
to object when you were wrong

When
When will you ever get sick of
listening to repeats
of what you have said?
You better listen instead
to folks who think with their own head

I never want to be your foe
I just wanna say I miss you so
How long will you stay in there?
I just wish that you could hear me singing

Step out, step out of your echo chamber
Step out, step out of your echo chamber
Before it is too late (late)
Before it is too late (late)
Before it is too late
'cos I miss you so

(Step out, step out of your) echo chamber
Oh, step out, step out of your echo chamber

Step out (step out)
before you go crazy
x2

Before it is too late (late)
Before it is too late (late)
Before it is too late
'cos I miss you so
