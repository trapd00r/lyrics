Yeah, I'm bringin' home some good news
Got some things you'll be glad to hear
Like I'm leavin' town, I'll be back around
Just long enough to get my gear
There won't be any goodbye kisses
Well, I'm puttin' on my leavin' shoes
This is the end we're through, it's over
Yeah, I'm bringin' home some good news

Well, I was sittin' downtown in a tavern
When I made up my mind to go
And I knew you would be so glad to be free
I just thought to call you to let you know
You can tell all your backdoor daddies
That your big daddy's done blew a fuse
This is the end we're through, it's over
Yeah, I'm bringin' home some good news

To you I been known as bad news
Well, I'm changin' my first name
And I'm givin' you your freedom, baby
That old race won't kinda change
Yeah, go to hide your lookman slippers
I won't be lookin' around for clues
This is the end we're through, it's over
Yeah, I'm bringin' home some good news

Good news, there's some good news for you honey
I'm bringin' home some good news
I'm bringin' home some good news, honey
