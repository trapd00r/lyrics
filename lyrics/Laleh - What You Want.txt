I'm a big girl honey now
I got my o-own money now
And the train is running now
Just outside my house

And I take it to my job
You know I just just got one
And I got a pure heart
'Cause my girlfriend said so

You know I got these strange thoughts
That everything is an illusion but
I could be happy facing it
I should be happy, I ask myself

What you want, baby?
And why do you want it?
What you want?

Oh.. Why you want it?
Oh.. What you want, babe?
Oh.. And why you want it?
Oh.. What you want, babe?
Oh.. And why you want it?
Oh...

If you can do it, I can do it
I gotta get mine sorted out
It's gonna take some time
And it can take forever

If you can do it, I can do it (If you can)
I gotta get mine sorted out
It's gonna take some time but
I'm gonna do my best now

You know the self-fulfilling prophecies
They were the ones that really got me here
And now they're gonna get me out of this
So everytime I'm gonna ask myself

What you want, babe?
Oh..And why you want it?
Oh.. What you want, babe?

And now I'm gonna get me out of this
So everytime I'm gonna ask myself

Oh.. And why you want it?
Oh.. What you want, babe?
Oh.. And why you want it? Why you want it?
Why, why, why, why?
What you want? What you want? What you want?
Oh....What you want.. What you want...
