You take your white finger
Slide the nail under
The top and bottom buttons of
My blazer
Relax the fraying wool
Slacken ties and I'm

Not to look at you in the shoe
But the eyes
Find the eyes

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
Will find me in the matinée
The dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée
The dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine

I time every journey
To bump into you accidentally, I
Charm you and tell you
Of the boys I hate, all the girls I hate

All the words I hate
All the clothes I hate
How I'll never be
Anything I hate

You smile, mention
Something that you like
Oh, how you'd have a happy life
If you did the things you like

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories, files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
Will find me in the matinée
Dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée
The dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine

So I'm on BBC2 now
Telling Terry Wogan how I made it and
What I made is unclear now
But his deference is
And his laughter is

My words and smile
Are so easy now
Yes, It's easy now
Yes, It's easy now

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
Will find me in the matinée
Dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée
The dark of the matinée

Will find me and follow me through corridors, refectories, and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
Will find me in the matinée
The dark of the matinée
Better in the matinée
The dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine
