Meeting you here, the night’s alight with midnight cheer
Our dust still unsettled, I feel the plucking of our petals
I’m drawing circles don’t you know, protect the seed that wants to grow
To a garden, pardon my territory

I’d fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I’m right for you
This kinda love don’t happen everyday

Be friendly but cautious, you’re gonna have to count your losses
Easily attracted, but dangerous to get distracted
I’m drawing circles don’t you know, protect the seed that wants to grow
To a garden, pardon my territory

I’d fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I’m right for you
This kinda love don’t happen everyday

I’d fight for you
I didn’t wanna have to raise my voice
I’m right for you
You really leave me with no choice

So what do you want and what are you thinking?
Isn’t it about time you stuck up for me?
But what you can’t see is we’re under siege
And I only fight because I believe
Not gonna share you no

I’d fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I’m right for you
This kinda love don’t happen everyday

I’d fight for you
I didn’t wanna have to raise my voice
I’m right for you
You really leave me with no choice

I’d fight for you
I didn’t wanna have to raise my voice
I’m right for you
You really leave me with no choice

I’d fight for you
I’m right for you
