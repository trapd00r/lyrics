Just as we hit the green
I've never been so happy to be alive
Only seven miles behind
You could smell the child
The smell of the front line's survival
With my silver Buddha
And my silver bullet

You learn to ride the Earth
When you're living on your belly
And the enemy is city birth
Who need radar?
We use scent
They stink of the West
Stink of sweat
Stink of cologne and baccy
And all their Yankee hash

With my silver Buddha
And my silver bullet
(I'm pulling on the pin)
Ooh I pull out, pull out the pin
(Pulling on the pin, woah)

Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
(Pull out the pin)
Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
(Pull out the pin)
Just one thing in it
Me or him
I love life
I love life
I love life
(Pull out the pin)

I've seen the coat for me
I'll track him 'til he drops
Then I'll pop him one he won't see
He's big and pink and not like me
He sees no light
He sees no reason for the fighting
With my silver Buddha
And my silver bullet

I had not seen his face
'til I'm only feet away
Unbeknown to my prey
I look in American eyes
I see little life
See little wife
He's striking violence up in me

With my silver Buddha
And my silver bullet
(Pulling on the pin)
Ooh I pull out, pull out the pin
(Pulling on the pin, woah)

Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
(Pull out the pin)
Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
(Pull out the pin)
Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
I love life
I love life
(Pull out the pin)

Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
(So I pull out the pin)
Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
(So I pull out the pin)
Just one thing in it
Me or him
And I love life
I love life
I love life
I love life
I love life
I love life
I love life
I love life
I love life
(Pull out the pin)
