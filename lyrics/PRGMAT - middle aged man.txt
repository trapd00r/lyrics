For you I'll
Take the extra supermarket trip
I do like
When you got a special craving for chips

For you I'll
Get some ice-cream, the one with oreo bits
Though I do like
When you walk down sugar isle with those hips

I'm ok when you claim I'm a dick in every way
If I may I'mma stay when your head gets in the way,

And I'm running in waterfalls of your
Vomiting snack patrol, mmmmh
Swimming in Oreo's and I'm
Liking it this bizar-izar-izar

I'm in the car on your demand
Cause I'm a fan of your motherly cans
Singing a song for you is not
Making me Romeo-eo-eo

For you I'll
Hold your head, when the morning's feeling sick
I do like
Your crazy side, when it's a little bit

I don't lie
When you start to throw a hissy fit
You do like
When your man, tells you where to sit

It's ok to be wrong and admit it in a way
When you say it's okay I'mma fuck you anyway

And I'm running in waterfalls of your
Vomiting snack patroll, mmmmh
Swimming in Oreo's and I'm
Liking it this bizar- izar- izar

I'm in the car on your demand
Cause I'm a fan of your motherly cans
Singing a song for you is not
Making me Romeo-eo-eo

Even though you got me so confused
Trust me babe, I don't mind a little bruise
Your mood swinging like the sixties, babe
And you do know I like the sixties, babe

Those extra pounds make you sexy
You don't have to look like Beyonce, test me

Running in waterfalls of your
Vomiting snack patroll, mmmmh
Swimming in Oreo's and I'm
Liking it this bizar-izar-izar

I'm in the car on your demand
Cos I'm a fan of your motherly cans
Singing a song for you is not
Making me Romeo-eo-eo

You're my one and only milf yeah, I like it
You're gonna be my one and only milf yeah, I love it
You're my one and only milf yeah, I like it
You're gonna be my one and only milf yeah, I love it

Mmmmh, I'll be your snack patrol
