You help me survive, you're the reason I'm alive
Speak softly, cyanide
Passed from your mouth into mine
Your breathing sounds like the sickest music playing backwards in my head
Contagions, so hellatious
You can't find the words so you scream instead

This lifeless ordinary
My righteous unsuspecting
I have a secret- you are a dichotomy

What won't kill me- makes me
What won't love me- hates me
What won't kill me, dies

You could help me hide, you could keep me inside,
Heart broken, petrified
What am I supposed to do if you don't try?
Mad symmetry, senseless poetry
Laying naked on my bed
Contracted and frustrated
You won't say a word and your eyes are dead

This lifeless ordinary
My righteous unsuspecting
I have a secret- you are a dichotomy

What won't kill me- makes me
What won't love me- hates me
What won't kill me, dies.......
What won't kill me- makes me
What won't love me- hates me
What won't kill me, dies

The whole fucking world's against us dude, I swear to God....
