He was nothing
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Going nowhere
Daddy was ashamed

Daddy was ashamed
He was something
Disgrace the family name

The family name, he was something

He was born for your crew
I've got nothing left to prove
If I die before I wake
Hope I don't come back asleep (Alt: Hope I don't come back a slave)

Leave this one, for your brew
I've got nothing left to prove
If I die before I wake
Hope I don't come back asleep (Alt: Hope I don't come back a slave)

I've got nothing left to prove
If I die before I wake
Hope I don't come back again
I'm dying!
