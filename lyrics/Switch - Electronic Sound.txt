Do better
Who better
You better?
Been around
Like hella propellers
Wanna know who you with
Don't tell him
Come on fellas, that ain't none of your biz'

Got on your body suit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today
She know my stick nothin' but magic bae
I'll be swinging it back and forth, 'til you in your casket, bae

Mmm, girl you want my best side, mmm
Bet you from the west side, mmm, mmm

I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
And could you tell me like it is
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

OK, say it loud, say it proud, you wanted more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do

You free to say whatever baby if you asking me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my Masters see

Throwing out the peace sign, mmm
Girl, I'm from the east side, mmm, mmm
Girl, you want my best side, mmm
Bet you from the west side, mmm, mmm

Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
And could you tell me like it is
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
And could you tell me like it is
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down it's honorable
Especially when the past ain't been that friendly to you
But there's magic in that

You're the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time
Hey, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine
We're more like fam
I raised you, you raised me, let's turn this whole life round

You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulder blades
And try to store the pain inside of me

Like why the world do you like that
Like they don't know you God-sent
But me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances
Thankin' God that he drew you like that

Beautiful black child
Come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile
I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog
Ears perk up at the sound of your name

Count on your main, wildfire
Can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, can drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix

Before I had you this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you

'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beaten you smart
'Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, lord

That she from the west side, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm, mmm

I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
And could you tell me like it is
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
