I used to have no walls around me
I was too free, if that's possible to be
No safety is what I mean
No solid foundation to keep me

But the sun's peeping out of the sky
Where it used to be only grey
The wolf is getting married
And he'll never cry again

Your smile makes me smile
Your laugh makes me laugh
Your joy gives me joy
Your hope gives me hope

And the sun's peeping out of the sky
Where it used to be only grey
The wolf is getting married
And he'll never cry again
Never cry again

Even when something terrible is happening
You laugh and that's the thing I love about you most
Yeah, even when something terrible is happening
You laugh and that's the thing I love about you most

Your smile makes me smile
Your laugh makes me laugh
Your joy gives me joy
Your hope gives me hope

And the sun's peeping out of the sky
Where it used to be only grey
The wolf is getting married
And he'll never cry again

Never cry again
