The sky is grey, it' s a lousy day and you
know I've been thinking about you again
I wish you were here right by my side
I wish you would stick with me all day
and all night

But deep inside I know you're gone and
you're not coming back you're not coming
back to me
There must be someone out there for
me, yeah someone just like you,
but where on earth could that person be

So here I am I light another Lucky
Strike, it's getting late, you know,
and I'm not doing fine
To tell you the truth I'm so fucked up
you're in my head all day and I can't
make it stop

But deep inside I know you're gone and
you're not coming back you're not coming
back to me
There must be someone out there for
me, yeah someone just like you,
but where on earth could that person be

It's a lousy day...
