I'm just a loc'd out brother
Com'n straight from S.D.
Just another islander, beaner, wop, minority
Taught to love one antogher, all races
All tipes of colors, different skin, different faces
Can you answer my question, when I ask you who is right?
Racists come in all forms of colors black of white
So take that when I say your hatred sucks!
Coming from the H-I-T man, so what's up?
If you ain't down with my white brother we ain't down with you
And if you ain't down with my clack brother then we ain't down with you
Punk, punk talking that trash
White trash, black trash, you get a back to back slap
You think I'm soft, the you don't know me
Cause no I don't play that and we're definitely not your homie
He'll take your pride for a long ride, try and hide
You hate my outside, how bout my inside
It's just me and my boys and we'll hit 'em up
Yeah, come on ya'll, get 'em up
One for peace, two for love and three for my G-O-D
Yeah, come on ya'll, get 'em up
Get your hands up
One for peace, two for love and three for my G-O-D
Now that's dread to you head for my final conclusion
Straight up acts 10 holmes it's Peter's vision
So get up Peter, kill and eat
Surely not Lord this meat is unclean
For my Lord makes nothing unclean
Creatures of the world, all beasts and human beings
Black or white, who is right?
Peace and love through my Lord Jesus Christ!
Then Peter began to speak, I now realize how God does not show
Favoritism but accepts man from every nation
Who fear Him and do what is right
Black or white, who is right?
