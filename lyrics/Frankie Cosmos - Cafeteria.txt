I am not the only one
Living in delusion
I go to the cafeteria
Cafeteria

Suddenly I noticed
That you weren't touching me
But sometimes I am weird and wrong
Sometimes I am weird and wrong

So late at night we eat the leftover rice
It was dark and empty
No one sees me
No one sees me

But I won't get married
Not at the party
Not at the party

I wasn't built for this world
I had sex once, now I'm dead
And I never look back
It only hurts my head

I know I listen to a lot
I think about it all the time
Okay sometimes I look
But only for a sec

I will never be touched
Never get loved
And I wonder what makes me so wrong
What makes me so wrong

I never felt like the one
Never felt like the one
