Make some noise
For the Venga
Vengaboys

There's a boy in my mind and he knows
I'm thinking of him
All my way to the day and the night
The stars shine above me
He's been gone for some time but I know 
I truly love him
And i'm singing this song
Hoping he'll be back when he hears it

My heart goes shalala lala
Shalala in the morning
Shalala lala
Shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala
Shalala in the evening
Shalala lala 
Shalala lala just for you

Make some noise for the Vengaboys

If your love's gone away just like mine
You'll feel like crying
Sing along maybe once maybe twice
Let's try it together
Some sweet day no one knows he'll return
And you'll be happy
Shout it sweet in a song
Listen to your heart it is singin'

My heart goes shalala lala
Shalala in the morning
Shalala lala
Shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala
Shalala in the evening
Shalala lala 
Shalala lala just for you

My heart goes shalala lala
Shalala in the morning
Shalala lala
Shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala
Shalala in the evening
Shalala lala 
Shalala lala just for you

Shalala lala just for you
