Trouble always follows me
But trouble ain't a bad place to be
I'll get my shit by it, if I can
But I stand on my own, and I'm
My own man

The only age I know is the
Dark age
All the people I know put me in a
Cage
The only age I know is the
Dark age
The only light I know is in this dark
Space
I'm the portrait of your patroniza-
Tion
Have you ever looked at my face?

They try to make a mess out of me
They're heading for a social cata-
Strophe

They try to make a mess out of me
Alienation, false masturbation,
Incrimination
My soul salvation, discrimination,
Isolation
No consolation here

Always follow me
Always follow me
Always follow me
Always follow me
Always follow me
Always follow me
Always follow me
