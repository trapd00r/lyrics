[Verse 1]
When you were young
And on your own
How did it feel
To be alone?
I was always thinking
Of games that I was playing
Trying to make
The best of my time

[Chorus]
But only love
Can break your heart
Try to be sure
Right from the start
Yes only love
Can break your heart
What if your world
Should fall apart?

[Verse 2]
I have a friend
I've never seen
He hides his head
Inside a dream
Someone should call him
And see if he can come out
Try to lose
The down that he's found

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I have a friend
I've never seen
He hides his head
Inside a dream
Yes, only love
Can break your heart
Yes, only love
Can break your heart
