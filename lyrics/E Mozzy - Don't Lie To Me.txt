Ya'll niggas know how I rock
Duck tape on the handle of the yap
All a nigga know is get guap
They don't wanna see me on top
Ya'll niggas know how I rock
Duck tape on the handle of the yap
All a nigga know is get guap
But they don't wanna see me on top (huh)

All a nigga know is get guap
Ya'll niggas know how I rock
Duck tape on the handle of the yap
All a nigga know is get guap
But they don't wanna see me on top

Still high off the cup of slime
I bang the hood cause in love with mines
Fell off a couple 100 times
But I got it back it happen all the time
Started off saran wrappin' dope
My little brother died, Shit I had to slide
Circle smaller ain't a rat in mines
Circle smaller ain't a rat in mines
Fruit Loops got roaches in it
I'm from the trenches I ain't gotta lie
The older homies got hella bodies
Them the ones I idolized
Set trip til my death my date
Ain't no way that umma compromise
I don't switch on that glickery
You know I went get the bitch modified

Ya'll niggas know how I rock
Duck tape on the handle of the yap
All a nigga know is get guap
They don't wanna see me on top
Ya'll niggas know how I rock
Duck tape on the handle of the yap
All a nigga know is get guap
But they don't wanna see me on top (huh)

All a nigga is get guap
Shit, I'm tryna get papered up
All a nigga know is that block
Shit, I gotta change it up
Had to knock me a new bitch
My old hoe didn't make enough
Had to cop me a new brick
I'm addicted to it, Can't get enough
All these flights a nigga catchin'
Ain't not tellin' where I go next
Can't fuck with no nigga that be on some hoe shit
Ya'll already know how I rock
It's one on top in that Glock, 30 stick or stock
They don't wanna see me on top

Ya'll nigga know I come [?]
My youngin' ridin' around with a Uzi
Head looked spit like a lugee
Down to the grizzle he gon' chew em'
That's yo wife but she callin' the nigga bookie
That's her nigga but her nigga hella bootsie
That's her daughter but her daughter hella groupie
And if I see her brother shit it might pop off
Cause I'm really tryna take a niggas top off
Drank up that clear a niggas block off
Man down now they got the street blocked off
Me and mines sittin' back like he chopped off
We comin' and we knownin' where you sleep
But you steady telling bitches where you be
We pulling up trippin' on a B
100 shots at them niggas like sheesh
