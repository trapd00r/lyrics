What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back
Back into time

No baby, no baby, no baby
No, no, no

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy
I'll go insane

No baby, no baby, no baby
No, no, no
No baby, no baby, no baby
No, no, no

You've got your problems baby
And I've got mine
Lets just end it all by putting it together, yeah
Then you say you love me
It don't mean a thing
If you cared
You'd be there
Like you used to be, yeah

I'm searching for the words to make you realize
That I really, really want you to stay
Oh, yeah
Tears of frustration I hold inside
But if you walk away
You'll make this grown man cry

[CHORUS:]
Don't leave
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me tonight
Don't leave me girl
Please stay with me to

Forget my pride girl
I'm begging you
You're my heart
You're my soul
You got so much control
My love runs deeper than the ocean and sea
But if you sail away
You take the center piece of me

[Chorus]

No, no, no

[Chorus]

Stay (come on and stay with me)
Stay (don't leave)
Stay (oh, yeah, yeah)
Stay right here with me forever (I love you)

Stay (yes I do)
Stay (I need you)
Stay (don't leave without you)
Stay right here with me forever
(No, oh, oh)

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, crazy, crazy insane

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy
I'll go insane

If you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy
I'll go insane

Stay (please stay with me)
Stay (forever)
Stay (forever)
Stay right here with me forever
(Baby don't take your love away, no, no, no, no)

Stay (stay with me)
Stay (cuz you know I love you)
Stay (you know I need you)
Stay right here with me forever
(Yes I do, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

No, no, no
No baby, no baby, no baby
