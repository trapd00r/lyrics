struck down by a prayer
and she compels you, you can't help it
drop down to your knees
she's in your mind and you are blinded
and she put a spell on you

she's nobodys angel
she's nobodys
nobodys angel

fever fever leave my heart alone
teardrops down my face
i curse the day that I was born

Lost inside her grace
and you surrender sweet surrender
bound within a sigh
she takes you under, keeps you under
and she puts a spell on you

still my fading heart beats for your love
still my fading heart beats for love
