I wanna hold you but you're out of reach 
somewhere searching for your inner peace 
I'm just looking for a little squeeze 
Face to face and cheek to cheek 

It's in your blood but not in mine 
What's in your blood is in my mind 
something's broken in the way we smile 
It is within us all the time 

You're well aquainted with the So- o- o-Ho 
And all the ”Ello” and ”Ow are 'u?” 
And we both have to get it on before the summer's gone 

We gotta hurry in our worry to get done today 
Cause one of us is gonna die young 
Let's put our money where our mouth is and get out today 
Cause one of us is gonna die young 
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young 
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young 
That's right
Aah, aah, aah, aah

And don't you take this the wrong way 
I'm not looking for a way to replace what love can give 
Cause you can't do that! 

I'm only saying that where I come from 
People find it very fashionable 
to burn like a flame 
Never get tame Grown-up and lame Yeah! Yeah! 

You're looking beat but you say: ”no, oh, no, no” 
”I'm all messed up and I'm ready to go! 
We ain't gonna go it alone no more So let's get on 
with the show…” 

There's a lot to be said and to be done today 
Cause one of us is gonna die young 
Before they put us in a coffin I've got things to say 
One of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young

Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
And there's a lot to be said and to be done today 
Cause one of us is gonna die young 

And you're chim-chim-chammy and 
your're wealthy and you're whammy
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young
