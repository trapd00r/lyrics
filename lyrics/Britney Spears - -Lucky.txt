Im Miss American Dream since I was 17
Dont matter if I step on the scene
Or sneak away into the Philippines
There still gon' be pictures of my derrier in the magazine
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece of me?
Im Miss bad media karma
Another day another drama
Guess I cant see no harm
In working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm
Im still an exception of panel
And you want a piece of me

Im Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
[You want a piece of me]
Im Mrs. Oh my God that Britneys Shameless
[You want a piece of me]
Im Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in
[You want a piece of me]
Im Mrs. shes too big now shes too thin
[You want a piece of me]

Im Mrs. You want a piece of me?
Tryin and pissin me off
Well get in line with the paparazzi
Whose flippin me off
Hopin Ill resort to start havoc
And end up settlin in court
Now are you sure you want a piece of me
Im Mrs. Most likely to get on the TV for strippin on the streets
When getting the groceries, no, for real..
Are you kidding me?
No wonder this panic in the industry
I mean, please
Do you want a piece of me?

Im Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous
[You want a piece of me]
Im Mrs. Oh my God that Britneys Shameless
[You want a piece of me]
Im Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in
[You want a piece of me]
Im Mrs. shes too big now shes too thin
[You want a piece of me]
