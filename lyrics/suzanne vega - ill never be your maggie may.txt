I'll never be your Maggie May

he one you loved and left behind

he face you see in light of day

nd then you cast away

hat isn't me in that bed you'll find


'd rather take myself away

e like those ladies in Japan

ather paint myself a face

onjure up some grace

r be the eyes behind a fan


nd so you go

o girl could say no

o you


here's the way we may appear

ut that will change from day to night

ould you ever see within?

nderneath the skin?

ould I believe you had that sight?


nd so you go

o girl could say no

o you


'll never be your Maggie May

he one you loved and then forgot

'll love you first and let you go

ecause it must be so

nd you'll forgive or you will not


nd so a woman leaves a man

nd so a world turns on it's end

o I'll see your face in dreams

here nothing's what it seems

ou still appear some kind of friend


nd so you go

o girl could say no 

o you
