Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
Then I pulled out in a day
To catch my breath some place far away

All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I

Tomorrow morning set me free
For many nights you'll never sleep
When I'm far from reaching out of sight
Enough to get me on my high tonight

All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I

Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
Farewell for now, farewell for now, farewell...

All to say no one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I do
