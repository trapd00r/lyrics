Oooh
If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range I guess
With silencer and stun

But I feel more like a needle
Always pulling on the thread
Always making the same point again 
And wondering if you heard what I just said

If you were a weapon
A hammer's what you'd be
Blunt and heavy at the end
And coming down on me

But I've concealed a weapon 
In a pocket knife attack
All folded up inside until you see the shine
And then you'll want it back

Oooh
If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range I guess
With silencer and stun

Well, if I am that weapon
I am pointing now at you
So just put down the hostage and we'll
Talk it down until we see this through
