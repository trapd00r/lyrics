I could tell that it was over
When his lips met mine
It was an emptiness in his voice
Hesitation when he smiled
He didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
He had found what he'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

I saw goodbye in his eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Who can't wash off her make-up
The life I wanted ‒ it was gone
Prince Charming ‒ he wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in his arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide his love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

I saw goodbye in his eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Now he sees right through me

Should I hold on to what we've got
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in his eyes
I saw goodbye in his eyes

I know you've got somebody new now
And all my candles have burned out
He's gonna love the way you shine
But so did I
So don't smile at me it ain't what you mean
(Goodbye)

With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me, goodbye in your eyes!)
Should I hold on
We will never make it (now you see right through me, goodbye in your eyes!)

Should I hold on
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that it's over
