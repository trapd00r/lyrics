Why don't you just love me the way you used to do?

Why don't you just love me the way you used to do?
Why don't you just love me the way you used to do?
My hair still curly, my eyes still green
I still the same as while you loved me

Why don't you just love me the way you used to do?
Why don't you just love me the way you used to do?
You said our love won't never fade
I'm still the same, why did you change?

Why don't you just love me the way you used to do?
Why don't you just love me the way you used to do?

Come back honey to me
Come back honey to me
Come back I do see you meant for me

Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
