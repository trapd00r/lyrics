Fergie

Sound selector, activate your transistor
Transmit the audio, whiz through your system
Sub-sonic mega bolt, bass drum be kickin'

Ghetto blaster blastin' on your block
Pumpin' out megahertz (mega-megawatts)
You can get electric shock from my flow
Bitches on my dick (Oh no) They on my dildo
Do re mi fa so la ti do
I get the money-money, I get dough
EQ the equalizer for the stereo

We the blast masters, the radiation
International, coming to your nation
Feel the... feel the... feel the... feel the vibration
We killin'...killin'...kill your radio station

Kill 'em with the sound, kill 'em kill 'em with the sound
Hit 'em with the frequency
Shoot 'em with the bass, shoot, shoot 'em with the bass
Super-mega frequency
Kick 'em with the drum, kick 'em kick 'em with the drum
Get 'em with the melody
Beat 'em with the beat, beat 'em beat 'em with the beat
Super-mega frequency

In the Electric City...
Electric City...
Electric City...
Electric...

Kill 'em

Taboo
Step up in the par... step up in the party
Sippin' on Coke and baca-Bacardi
Beats so dope, been a trip, my body
Lord have mercy... lord'a... lord have mercy
La dee dee dee deedeedeedee la dee da
Killer on the lose like I'm Jeffrey Dahmer
Willy to produce mega rhythm, yes sir!
Call me mad scientist, the professor

Will.i.am
I program the rhythm
Ask 'em who kill em, they say will.i.am did 'em
Boom boom pow, that's my style when I hit 'em
I know how to kill 'em when I kill 'em

Fergie
Kill 'em with the sound, kill 'em kill 'em with the sound
Hit 'em with the frequency
Shoot 'em with the bass, shoot, shoot 'em with the bass
Super-mega frequency
Kick 'em with the drum, kick 'em kick 'em with the drum
Get 'em with the melody
Beat 'em with the beat, beat 'em beat 'em with the beat
Super-mega frequency

In the Electric City...
Electric City...
Electric City...
Electric...

K-k-k-k-k-k-k-kill...

Apl.de.ap
Electric shock surgin' down your city
Higher voltage, B.E.P committee
Transmitting sound got the girlies silly
Bouncin' around tryin' to show me titties
Watch out now, we about to blow
Big room now wants a look that's general
Energy got the whole system overload
Got the yo, got the eardrums about to explode
Extra, extra flow be powerful
Blow your mind it's the incredible
Apl.de.ap, the original
I'm the thriller of Manila, L.A's Filipino

Fergie
Kill 'em with the sound, kill 'em kill 'em with the sound
Hit 'em with the frequency
Shoot 'em with the bass, shoot, shoot 'em with the bass
Super-mega frequency
Kick 'em with the drum, kick 'em kick 'em with the drum
Get 'em with the melody
Beat 'em with the beat, beat 'em beat 'em with the beat
Super-mega frequency

In the Electric City...
Electric City...
Electric City...
