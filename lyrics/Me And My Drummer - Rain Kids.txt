This means indulgence for the rain kids
I hope they survive
I know what you're thinking
But this is a waste in the end
But I hope
That they survive

Whatever I said to you
It was a lie
Help them when you get there
And don't walk on by
Nod your head in your mind
When they are around
Trust me I am the man
Attack me instead of making me proud

This is not true
But it's good for now
They will slip from my hands anyhow
This is not good
But they're almost done
All the boys keep leaning on my shoulders
Yeah

Don't try to ignore me
I'm everywhere in the room
Don't leave me in this jungle
I'm everywhere in the room
Don't try to ignore me
I'm everywhere in the room
Don't pull me away
Don't pull me away from my power
Away from my power

Don't try to ignore me
I'm everywhere in the room
Don't pull me away
Don't pull me away from my power
Away from my power
Don't try to ignore me
I'm everywhere in the room
Don't pull me away
Don't pull me away from my power
Away from my power
