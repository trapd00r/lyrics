I gotta think of something
To make you think less
Of me, that I am nothing
To hold on to, 'cause we are through
I dislike you

(Refr.)
I wish that you could hate me
Then things would be so easy
Just get me off your mind
If the bitch would have a son
Then I would be the one
So hate me

Geese, flying from the winter
That's what I should do, do, do
Or become a sprinter
And run away
'Cause we are through
I dislike you

I wish that you could hate me
Then things would be so easy
Just get me off your mind
If the bitch would have a son
Then I would be the one

I am being mean
Like no one's ever been
Just hate me...

I wish that you could hate me
Then things would be so easy
Just get me off your mind

(Refr.)
