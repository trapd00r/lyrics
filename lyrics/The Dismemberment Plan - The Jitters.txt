No one means what they say 
And you can tell as clear as deep-sea fish 
All internal organs and glowing eyes 
I've been good, I've been busy 
I've realized my friend's true intentions 
Cut all ties 
I've been doing ten thousand pushups a day 
Plastic cube filled with pus that sits atop my supervisor's desk 
The feeling of ice on the inside of a wrist 
Always tired, need a nap 
I have to make myself brush my teeth 
I've made a list of everything I've ever owned 

When the days bring nothing new 
And the sound of laughter makes you sick 
And snide 
You know you've got the jitters 

Nothing's wrong, I'm just fine 
I've realized I just don't like jokes 
I'm thinking of moving I can't call anyone back 
You can tell every time they lean away 
When you just want to talk 
You couldn't buy their interest now 
Stolen cars in a heap 
A naked body on the neighbor's yard 

When they let you down on cue 
When you give up way before you even try 
You know you've got 
You've got the jitters 

They glow as they near 
Then disappear 
Like highway signs on a starless night 
And it's so hard to tell who's being fled 
And who's in flight
