Yeah, woah (woah), I did it on my solo
'Member I was so low, no one wanted photos (yeah)
Now I'm on the big screen (huh), used to eat at Wendy's (yeah)
Got rich overnight, it's like I married Mrs. Winfrey (Woah)
And now I'm doin' shows (yeah), and I brought all my bros (yeah)
And I got all these powers (huh), I'll vanquish all my foes (wow)

Ikuyo, I think we got one (got it) (ya)
I put the team up on my back like I'm Marshawn (Marshawn Lynch)
When I asked niggas for help, yo I got none (woah)
When I did this shit myself's when it got done (yes) (2 Chainz)
Yeah, woah (woah)

[2 Chainz:]
Thawed off with the top down
High speed like the cop's 'round (huh?)
Dick tall, made her climb up
Then after that, made her hop down (Down)
Draymond with the lockdown (yeah)
Look at my baby pictures, had an AR in the background (Bah, bah)
Tell the squares I'm back 'round (yeah)
Black out, won't back down
Sak 'round, walk in no pat down, then sat down (No, no)
If I'm here, my strap 'round
My girl brown, her tongue wild
Gunpowder, shoot 'til I run out (what? what? oh!)
Brighter than a sunflower, roll a joint to last one hour
All I need is one mic, I got stripes like an umpire
Hotter than a brush fire (ooh), Drench God, Drench Messiah
Up there, but I can get higher, up late, I don't get tired
Seen me on 6'5", stood on a quarter milli'
That made me 6'9", that made you itty-bitty
I like when she independent
'Cause when I try to buy her shit, she say she don't need it (She don't need it, she don't need it)
Ha, cool with me
