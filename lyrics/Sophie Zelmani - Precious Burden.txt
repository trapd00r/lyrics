the life we shared together
is no life anymore
it's time to place the memories
and put them wherever they can grow
so you live in the stars now
you live in the meads
I'll spread you with my heart 
over the fertile fields

the love we gave each other
was the love that we would make
those years became a lifetime
a lifetime fate would break
now you're living in the oceans
in the trees, in the air
it's a precious burden 
the cross that come to bear

this burden
is a precious burden
as precious as you
brought into my world
the world that's up to you
