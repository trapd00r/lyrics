It's so hard to tend
The heart of this man
And not before the day's gone
I'm sure i'll hold him again
I think I'm losing the grip
Or I could let it slip

I guess until the day's gone
I seem to work on hat rift
But I can't, don't you see
I Just can't

You want me to speak
And so my dumbness gets me weak
It hurts when the day's gone
That I'm tired of your needs
And I couldn't , I just couldn't
It's so hard to give

I should make you live
But after the day's gone
You want me to forgive
It's so hard to lose

The dream came so close
And now when the day's gone
Everyone knows
I can't
I just can't
