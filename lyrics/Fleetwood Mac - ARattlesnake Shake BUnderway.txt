[Verse 1]
Baby, if you got to rock
I got to be your rocking horse
Baby, think you'd like to roll
Maybe your digging it more
They're shaking the world
When it's time to crash
But when I get home tonight
I guess I got to shake myself

[Chorus]
You need some love
You must have the blues
Ain't but the one thing
A good man can do
He do the shake
The rattlesnake shake
Man, do the shake
Yes, and jerk away the blues
Now, jerk it

[Chorus]
Now, I know this guy
His name is Mick
Now, he don't care when he ain't got no chick
He do the shake
The rattlesnake shake
Yes, he do the shake
And jerks away the blues
Now, jerk it
