I got breast implants,
Payed by my boyfriends.
I got a botox injection under my skin,
I only play with sex, but I don't let them in!
I got fake nails, don't answer e-mails.
I am a sillicon valley walking on two legs,
What's the price of the world? I can write a check!

(Refr.:)
'Cause I'm a 21st Century digital Girl,
I don't know how to love, but I live in this world.
My daddy is a work-a-holic millionaire.
My mom is on drugs, but I don't really care!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah!
(/Refr.)

I got a pussycat,
Right in my Gucci bag,
I've got a first class ticket, everythings permitted,
'Cause I can have it all!
