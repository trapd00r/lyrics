[Verse: Monsta KiD]
This the ride right here?

West Side chilling nigga
This is where I'm from
(West)
Hanging with yo bitch
I swear that pussy
Stay in my face
I need a short light
Skin to be my friend
Bad bihh in Cove that
Wanna burn my dro
Now we
Uber to the clinic
Bout to pay my other
Bitch a visit
Love it how you place
Them pasties
On yo titties
So I hit you
Then I ask you
What you got for me
She said some Super Mario
Fire ass broccoli
Love it how you
Pack my eighths
Real fucken stocky
(Uhh)
Smoking on that strong
No GMOs
Or HGH
Put you in yo fucking place
When you smoke this
Bruce Banner
They say fuck weed
I say nahh
Fuck cancer
Marijuana be the answer
Low budget niggas
Fear that green
Allergic to cream
Allergic to money
I'm allergic to bullshit
Like a sneeze
Now peep my steeze
I trust no hoe
When it comes to pimpin
I'm a keep it G
And mind my business
In a circle that
Have no curfew
I'm on some shit
That'll nurse you
Up in the Uber
With some bitches
That's all on my dick
Like bird food
I'd lying if I said
I don't do it for the riches
Niggas mad
Niggas tripping
Niggas need to quit
They bitching
I'm baking bread
In this mothafucking kitchen
Absent minded
Like I love ditching
Hate to be you nigga
Cause I got
Yo female switching
You know damn well
I'm hitting
(Sorry)
