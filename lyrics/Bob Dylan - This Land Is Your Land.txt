As I went walking 
That ribbon of highway
I saw above me 
An endless skyway
I saw below me 
That golden valley
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled 
I followed my footsteps
Through the sunny bright sands of 
Her diamond deserts
And all around me 
A voice came singing
Singing this land was made for you and me

This land is your land
And this land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

It was early one morning 
And I was strolling
With the wheat fields waving 
And dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting
A voice comes chanting

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Nobody living
Can ever stop me
As I go walking
My freedom highway
Nobody living
Can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
And this land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me
