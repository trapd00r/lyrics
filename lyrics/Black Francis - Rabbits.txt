We sailed along the fields of green
I didn't know it was my last scene
Nay, goodbye, nay, adieu
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view

Maybe light caught in my eye
And we were thrown into the wild rye
I hope you know my love was true
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view

There is a hole
For every soul
I slipped right through
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view
Nay, goodbye, nay, adieu
I couldn't see the rabbits hiding out of view
