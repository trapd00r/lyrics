There are some things I may not know there are some places I can't go 
But I am sure of this one thing my God is real for I can feel him in my soul 
My god is real real in my soul my God is real for he has washed and made me whole 
His love for me is like pure gold my God is real for I can feel him in my soul 

Some folks may doubt some folks may scorn 
Well they can all go on just leave me alone 
But ask for me I'll take God's part my God is real for I can feel him in my heart 
My god is real real...
