Drowing in our days
As the night owl left his trees
Calm is raising fast

That our best is shown our worst
Change, I love the past
Let go of what we had
Our lives are on repeat
Working hard, holding the peace

We will try to overcome
We will try

And just hold on
And we'll go on
And just hold on

If you're worthy
I can show
There's a way out

Tell me where we hide
On the sideline of our life
Show me what it's like
When the worries of your chest
And all that we leave behind
In this crazy state of mind
The roses are our ground
They need rain clouds when without

So they can grow to the sun
They can grow

And just hold on
And we'll go
And just hold on
If you're worthy
I can show
There's a way out

And the truth hurts
Love burns
We're growing up
Learn just a little
And the truth hurts
Love burns
We're growing up
Learn just a little

Learn just a little
