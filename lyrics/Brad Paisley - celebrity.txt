Someday I'm gonna be famous;
Do I have talent--well, no.
These days you don't really need it
Thanks to reality shows.

Can't wait to date a supermodel;
Can't wait to sue my dad;
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari
On my way to rehab.

Chorus:
'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality.
You' can act just like fool,
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV.
I can throw major fits
When my latte isn't just how I like it.
They'll say I've gone insane,
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity.

I get to cry to Barbara Walters
When things don't go my way.
I'll get community service
No matter which law I break.

I'll make the supermarket tabloids;
They'll write some awful stuff.
But the more they run my name down,
The more my price goes up!

Chorus:
'Cause when you're a celebrity,
It's adios reality.
No matter what you do,
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV.
I can fall in and out of love,
Have marriages that barely last a month;
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough
Being a celebrity.

So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of fun in the sun.
We'll be real world Bachelor
Jackass Millionaires.
Hey, Hey, Hollywood
Here we come!

Chorus:
Yeah, when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality.
No matter what you do,
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV.
Being a celebrity.
Yeah celebrity!
Uh huh
Ugh. Where's my coffee?
