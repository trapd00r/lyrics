Authors & Composers : Norell/Oson/Bard

It's a friday night
We're on the road again
Another town another scene
Another audience
But you're not here with me
I keep on calling you

When I'm standing in the spotlight
What am I to do
I'm losing my mind without you

CHORUS

I tried to give a good face
And keep the action in place
On the stage I belong
But where do I go with my heart
When the music is gone

It was the night when you called
And said you're leaving it all
But the show must go on
Now where do I go with my heart
When the music is gone

Although you're far away
I wishe'd you understand
It's on the stage I can express
This is the way I am
Though you're not here with me
This song is meant for you

When I'm standing in the spotlight
What am I to do
I'm losing my mind without you

CHORUS

After the show at my hotel
I close the door and think of you
Lost in my loneliness ohhh

CHORUS
