Don't try to call
There are some bridges that burn
Beyond recognition
Beyond repair
Don't say you've changed
There are some forces that turn
Beyond recollection, beyond my stare
When I feel the cold in the dark 
I know you're there

Long ago 
I was a woman in pain
A woman in need
I ran to you
Long ago 
I did not understand
You were making me bleed
I ran to you
When I feel the cold in the dark
I know what you do

I will crawl through my past
Over stones, blood and glass
In the ruins
Reaching under the fence
As I try to make sense
In the ruins

I know your heart 
Has held its own fear
It's perfectly clear 
What they did to you 
But in my heart 
It's the screaming I hear
I won't let them come near 
Since my love knew you
When I feel the cold in the dark
I remember you

I will crawl through my past
Over stones, blood and glass
In the ruins
Reaching under the fence
As I try to make sense
In the ruins

Night after night
I am carving it out
I will carry it down 
To the waterside
Night after night
I am hearing the sound
Of wings that come beating
I will not hide
When I feel the cold in the dark
I will know why

But I will crawl through my past
Over stones, blood and glass
In the ruins
Reaching under the fence
As I try to make sense
In the ruins

But if I am to heal
I must first learn to feel
In the ruins
I will crawl 
I will crawl
I will crawl
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
