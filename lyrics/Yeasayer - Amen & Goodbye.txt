Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa...

The holy market gets you high
The holy market gets you low
Easy come, easy go
A wicked mind on panic throne

It's just another fake-god
Just another slight of hand to keep control
Just another fake-out
A mock-up of the Dead, mockup of the Dead Sea Scrolls

Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa...

The moloch demands sacrifice
To grease the wheels and mechanize
The bottom line is all he knows
The wand wielders have hearts of stone

It's just another fake-god
Just another slight of hand to keep control
Just another fake-out
A mock-up of the Dead, mockup of the Dead Sea Scrolls

Scrollllssss!!
