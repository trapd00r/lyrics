Love is my passion, love is my friend
Love is universal, love never ends
Then why am I faced with so much anger, so much pain?
Why should I hide? Why should I be ashamed?

Time's much too short
To be living somebody else's life
I walk with dignity
I step with pride

'Cause I ain't movin' from my face
From my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love
My peaceful dove, it means too much to me

Loving itself can be so hard
Honesty can be demanding
Learn to love yourself
It's a great, great feeling

When you're down baby, I will set you free
I will be your remedy, I will be your tree
A wise man is clever, seldom ever speaks a word
A foolish man keeps talking, never is he heard, no no no no

Time's much too short
To be living somebody else's life
I walk with dignity
I step with pride

'Cause I ain't movin' from my face
From my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love
My peaceful dove, it means too much to me

Loving itself can be so hard
Honesty can be demanding
Learn to love yourself
It's a great, great feeling

'Cause I ain't movin' from my face
From my race, from my history
I ain't movin' from my love
My peaceful dove, it means too much to me

Loving itself can be so hard
Honesty can be demanding
If we learn to love ourselves
We'll have great, great feelings

'Cause I ain't movin', I've been here long before
I ain't movin', 'cause I want more
I ain't movin', got my feet on the ground
As far as I'm concerned, love should win the rounds
