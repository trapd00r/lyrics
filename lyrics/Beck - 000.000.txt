All the way
Pixel in the light
Comin' next year
All the way
Pixel in the light
All the way
Pixel in the light
Gettin' rich there
All the way
Pixel in the light

I see a broken door
I dream of silver spoon
I bought a plastic light
My separate silver wing
My suit into this cloak
My golden book she smokes
My ancient plays unfold
But she will never hope
My triple roses burst
My serpent has a curse
My serpent has a curse
My serpent has a curse
All the way
Pixel in the light
Comin' next year
All the way
Pixel in the light

My convalescent kiss
My barely modest choice
My pricks and belly wounds
My operation groans
My yellow Alamos
My new pollution clothes
I never spot the blood
My foolish captain heard
My temple house is bust
My serpent has?
My serpent has?
My serpent has?
