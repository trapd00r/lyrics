Oh, in the dead of night
Adrift on the ocean wide
High on the mountain side
You can count on me

If you're deep in the jungle boy
Caught in a winter storm
Kidnapped by anyone
I'll set you free

Say the word - I'll be there
To give you love and care
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Say the word - I'll be there
I'll reach you anywhere
Nothing can keep me away from you

If you're lost in the wilderness
Can't tell the east from west
Just feeling second best
I won't let you down
The night comes around again
And you're with a friend
I'll love to the very end
I'll come around

Say the word - I'll be there
To give you love and care
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Say the word - I'll be there
I'll reach you anywhere
Nothing can keep me away from you

If you're deep in the jungle boy
Caught in a winter storm
Kidnapped by anyone
I'll set you free

Say the word - I'll be there
To give you love and care
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Say the word - I'll be there
I'll reach you anywhere
Nothing can keep me away from you

Say the word - I'll be there
To give you love and care
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Say the word - I'll be there
I'll reach you anywhere
Nothing can keep me away from you

Say the word - I'll be there
To give you love and care
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Say the word - I'll be there
I'll reach you anywhere
Nothing can keep me away from you
