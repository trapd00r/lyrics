[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin' wit ya
Still waters run deep.
Still Snoop Dogg & D.R.E.
'99 nigga.

[Dr. Dre:]
Guess who's back?

[Snoop Dogg:]
Still, still doin' that shit, huh Dre?

[Dr. Dre:]
Oh for show.

[Snoop Dogg:]
Yeah.

[Dr. Dre:]
Check me out.

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown alot, can't keep it home alot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off.
How nigga? My last album was The Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it.

[Snoop Dogg:]
If you ain't up on things.

[Dr. Dre:]
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my gang
Still puffin' my leafs
Still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police.

[Snoop Dogg:]
Uh uh.

[Dr. Dre:]
Still rock my khakis with a cuff & a crease.

[Snoop Dogg:]
For show.

[Dr. Dre:]
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213.

[Snoop Dogg:]
For life.

[Dr. Dre:]
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still.

(Chorus - twice)
[Snoop Dogg:]
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world.
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl.

[Dr. Dre:]
Still takin' my time to perfect a beat
& I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[2nd Verse: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me & Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
& even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the AM compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til your soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's & Akmatics
Swap meets, sticky green & bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D.R.E.

(Chorus - twice)
[Snoop Dogg:]
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world.
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl.

[Dr. Dre:]
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
& I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether your coolin' on a corner wit your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangsta's all across the world.
Still...

[Snoop Dogg:]
Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl.

[Dr. Dre:]
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back.

[Snoop Dogg:]
So if you ain't up on things.

[Dr. Dre:]
Dr. Dre be the name still runnin' the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin' love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they mom's out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbecue's every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless.

(Chorus - 3 times)
[Snoop Dogg:]
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl.

[Dr. Dre:]
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
& I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Right back up in your muthafuckin' ass
'95 plus 4 pennies!
Add that shit up, D.R.E. right back up on top of things
Smoke somethin' wit your dog
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Oooh wee! Put it in the air
Oh you's a fool D.R.
[laugh]
