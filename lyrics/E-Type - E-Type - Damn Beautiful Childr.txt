Back when you, when you were my darlin
I didn’t mind to lose a little sleep
I didn’t mind to do a little walkin
Reputation never meant that much to me

How do I find that old familiar feeling?
The one that carried me so many years ago
Fun was dominoes and 7Up and Seagram’s
Thing were simple then just movin nice and slow

Ain’t it strange?
Well, ain’t it strange?

Well I had no clue, I’d be the boy who
Your momma warned you about
Well I had no clue, I’d…be the boy who
Your momma warned you about

Well, that old scene is always comin to me
I see you standin with your husband and your child
And you’re a picture of strength, and grace and beauty
And me I’m just a fool in a super market aisle

Well I, well know hello would surly end up awkward
I never had the knack for talkin any way
You’re not the kind for bending over backwards
Smile and turn my shopping cart around and walk away

Ain’t it strange
Well, ain’t it strange

Well I had no clue, I’d be the boy who
Your momma warned you about
Well I had no clue, I’d be the boy who
Your momma warned you about

Ain’t it stange how well I knew you back when I was 17
Lovin you was easy babe but I was just a child
And these days you ain't nothin just an interstate daydream
Folks were sleepin and we were runnin wild

And I still do my share of sleepin on the floor
Not sure if anybody knows me anymore

Well I had no clue, I’d be the boy who
Your momma warned you about
Well I had no clue, I’d be the boy who
Your momma warned you about
