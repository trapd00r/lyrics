I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said, "Seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade
And watch the rolling heads"

The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggars' change
And gave it to the rich

The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch, yeah
Singing

One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
The day I tried to live

Words you say never seem
To live up to the ones
Inside your head
The lives we make
Never seem to ever get us anywhere
But dead

The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud with
All the other pigs

One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
The day I tried to live

I woke the same as any other day, you know
I should have stayed in bed

The day I tried to win
I wallowed in the blood and mud with
All the other pigs

And I learned that I was a liar
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)
I learned that I was a liar (one more time around)

One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
The day I tried to live

Just like you
Just like you

One more time around
One more time around
