I’m just your average man, managing myself around the circles
Paddling through ravage and water to stay on surface
Babble up to those who battle against the workers
Champion the folks with an adequate sense of purpose
Flow sick, got it down so quick, cause you know my pen is blazing
Modern day lamentation
For a medicated generation
Poppin pills to the left and the right
Just to get through the night
Man, you all just scared that I can’t do for the rest of your life
I got my credit car, debit card always in my pocket
Clear my mind, make me blind all over little bit of options
Hand tied to the back
And I’m blind to the fact
That it’s all so wrong
Got me oblivious to what is going on

And when the night time comes
You better get some rest
Cause you know that we got work to do
This whole situation, got me disillusioned
And you don’t know what we’re going through
Said: when the night time comes
You better get some rest
Cause you know that we got work to do
This whole situation, got me disillusioned
And you don’t know what we’re going through

I’m might be mumbling like Mister Edge
Strong out on prescription meds
Numbing down my senses till my confidence is stripped to shreds
Money got us kneeling like a kick to the chin
Money we don’t even have will make us spit in the wind
But I fight for the risk to get of the shoulder path
Make us feel like a rolled up cab
All you do is smoke in the back
Helping the man to put a hole in the map
To mark the spot where you used to stand, ain't that a shame
Now it’s numbers in the name, puppets in the game, mixed in the same damn chain-
System, free the people, breeding evil, thinking that’s it’s freedom like
We’re all a bunch of high exalted, god-created equals
But if the money leads us, the leaders must be followers
Headed where the mighty dollar is, maybe that’s just what the problem is

And when the night time comes
You better get some rest
Cause you know that we got work to do
This whole situation, got me disillusioned
And you don’t know what we’re going through
Said: when the night time comes
You better get some rest
Cause you know that we got work to do
This whole situation, got me disillusioned
And you don’t know what we’re going through
