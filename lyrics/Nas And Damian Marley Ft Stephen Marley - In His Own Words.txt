Jr. Gong:
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Nas:
Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder

How many times I'm one of six coffin-holders
Or I'm sitting with goons in a visiting room?
Flip it, I could've been you behind state walls bidding
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us

A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for
Or a shorty to take the weight from
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw God's face on the design on my vintage Claiborne

Swear I see 'em every day in the bus or the train
Or the billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for him, have faith for him
No matter what his name's called

Jr. Gong:
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Hey, can you think of a color that you've never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you've never been?
Well, is many are called but them never deemed
Worthy for the cause 'cause them never clean

Help who help themselves, Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah, Jah like a cherubim
Keep us strong through the winter like an evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seems

All things are related and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage? Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor stop we through the passage

Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keep His word, don't care what the plan is
Don't be astonished, stumbling blocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, woah

Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Nas:
Some people ask me if I feel the Zionists are real
And in my songs do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is only ones I'm taking care of

But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of

Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combination of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition getting high with my brethren

Could've asked us why Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons, suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
It's like it's been exchanged for this penicillin

Jr. Gong:
Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through
