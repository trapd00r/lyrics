In the name of the heart
Just call me darling...

Funny how it goes sometimes
Pain, and lovers can't restrict it
Funny how it rains in sunshine
Will I see your pretty face tomorrow

It was something I never should have started
How can I hide my misery?

In the name of the heart, just call me darling
I will be there
In the name of the heart, I'll wait forever
I will be there, I'll be there for you

Funny how it goes sometimes
You can take away all of my sadness
Funny how it rains in sunshine
Won't you stay with me until tomorrow

This was something I never could believe in
All of the love you gave to me

In the name of the heart, just call me darling
I will be there
In the name of the heart, I'll wait forever
I will be there, I'll be there for you

I would sell my soul for you
