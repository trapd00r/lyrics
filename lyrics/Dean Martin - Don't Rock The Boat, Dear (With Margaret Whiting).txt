Don't rock the boat dear
Keep our love afloat dear
Strike that happy note dear
We're not lost at sea

Keep our love ready
And never high or heady
Always keep it steady
The way it ought to be

Even though we're out in deep water
We must save the future for sons and daughters
Don't rock the ship dear
Here's a little tip dear
Make each trip a pip dear
Just for the likes of you and me

Don't rock the yacht dear
Don't you go to pot dear
This year is a hot year
We're not lost at sea

Don't rock the scow now
Charm me off the bow now
Love me here and now
Wow the way it ought to be

Even though we're out in deep water
We must save the future for sons and daughters
Don't rock the sloop dear
Don't be nincompoop dear
Lovers loop the loop dear
It was made for us

Don't rock the craft dear
We're not on a raft dear
Love before and aft dear
Don't rock the boat dear
Keep our love afloat dear
Strike that happy note dear dear
Just for the likes of you and me
