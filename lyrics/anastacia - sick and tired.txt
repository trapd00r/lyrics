My Love is on the line, my love is on the line 
My Love is on the line, my love is on the line 
2x(Dil La Liya Be-parvah dey naal) 
My Love is on the line, my love is on the line 

A little late for all the things you didn't say 
I'm not sad for you 
But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste 
'Cause I learned the truth 
Your heart is in a place I no longer want to be 
I knew there'd come a day I'd set you free 'cause 
I'm sick and tired of always being sick and tired 

2x(Dil La Liya Be-parvah dey naal) 

Your love is unfair 
You live in a world where you didn't listen 
And you didn't care 
So I'm floating, I'm floating on air 
4x(Dil La Liya Be-parvah dey naal) 
(I am on air) 

No warning of such a sad song 
Of broken hearts 
My dreams of fairy tales and fantasies 
were torn apart ohhh 
I lost my peace of mind somewhere along the way 
I knew there'd come a time you'd hear me say 
I'm sick and tired of always being sick and tired 

2x(Dil La Liya Be-parvah dey naal) 

Your love is unfair 
You live in a world where you didn't listen 
And you didn't care 
So I'm floating, I'm floating on air 

My Love is on the line, my love is on the line 
My Love is on the line, my love is on the line 

2x(Dil La Liya Be-parvah dey naal) 

My Love is on the line, my love... 

Your love is unfair 
You live in a world where you didn't listen 
And you didn't care 
So I'm floating, I'm floating on air 

Your love isn't fair 
You live in a world where you didn't listen 
And you didn't care 
So I'm floating, I'm floating on air
