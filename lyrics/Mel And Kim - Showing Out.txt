Show show showing out

Get fresh at the weekend, showing out, showing out
get fresh at the weekend, showing out, showing out

You'd better live in love than luxury, it's alright
And don't go dining out on foolish dreams every night
It only takes a moment to feel alright

Get fresh at the weekend, showing out, showing out
get fresh at the weekend, showing out, showing out

We can't afford to wear diamond and pearl, that's ok
wouldn't want to be that kind of girl anyway
It only takes a moment to feel alright

Get fresh at the weekend, showing out, showing out
get fresh at the weekend, showing out, showing out

I can supply you things I can provide everything
If it's the man's hand that pays the price
then you belong to me

Can't afford to buy finer things that's alright
we wont lose our heads for anything, any time
It only takes a moment to feel alright

Get fresh at the weekend, showing out,showing out
