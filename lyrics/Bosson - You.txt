You, you make all my dreams come true

Another time the lesson learned
another one that crashed and burned
but I believe there is someone for everyone

A small cafe and lots of noice
a crowded place but just one voice
and from that moment I saw your face
I just knew

You, you make all my dreams come true
An angel smiled at me
the finest thing I've seen
baby you, you make all my dreams come true
a shining star I see
that heaven sent to me
that heaven sent to me

I've been ignored I've been deceived
I hardly enjoy the goals I've achieved
And what's the meaning of success
that you can't share

Although I'm used to being apart
I'll never get used to a broken heart
But when I see you
I gladly take that risk again

You, you make all my dreams come true
An angel smiled at me
the finest thing I've seen
baby you, you make all my dreams come true
a shining star I see
that heaven sent to me
that heaven sent to me

You...

You...

I feel in love with you today
I fell in love when I first saw you
and I hope you see me too
and if you don't I do
understand and that is ok
but I have never felt this way

You, you make all my dreams come true
An angel smiled at me
the finest thing I've seen
baby you, you make all my dreams come true
a shining star I see
that heaven sent to me
that heaven sent to me

You..
You, you make all my dream come true
I hope and I believe that we are meant to be.
