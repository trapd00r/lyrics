The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere, he didn't care
He stood in a field where barley grows

His head did no thinking his arms didn't move
Except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows

The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate 'cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind
He stood in a field where barley grows
