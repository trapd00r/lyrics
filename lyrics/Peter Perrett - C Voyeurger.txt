I search the crowd lookin' for her face
Hopin' she's there
Somethin' reminds me in every single place
I see her everywhere

That feelin' makes it easier to take
Almost like she's near
Time is frozen just waitin' for the day she'll be here
She'll be here

I can't live without the girl I love
There's no point livin' in a world without her love
I wait for you
I crave for you
Oh

If I could return it to a state of grace
I'd do it now
Like it came and went and didn't leave a trace
I'd do it now
A runaway train travelin' in reverse
Headin' down the line
Solution or problem, don't know which came first
We came unstuck in time

I can't live without the girl I love
There's no point livin' in a world without her love
I wait for you
I crave for you
Oh

The voyage of discovery, head buried in the sand
As the tide came in
Could never be enough for me to ever understand
Or even try to begin

Driven to the point where life and death collide
Your brain in traction
Driven by the purest snow to fall out of the skies
Driven to abstraction

I can't live without the girl I love
There's no point livin' in this world when she's gone
I wait for you
I crave for you
I wait for you (I'm gonna be there)
I crave for you (I'll be outta here)
Ah (With the girl I love)
Ah (I'm gonna be there soon)
Ah
