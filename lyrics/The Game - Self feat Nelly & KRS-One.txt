[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck... no
I don't give a fuck... no
Sex-money-murder we call this the hit em' up flow
Barely 15 got my first triple beam
Tryna get with fatcat and papy 2 do my thing
I'm jus a kid with ambitions and visions of gettin cream
Ronald reagen told me "yo joey jus do ya thing"
Now I'm lookin back man I ain't have no conscience
Slap a nigga silly til them niggaz fell unconscience
Speakin of my conscience
Now it would be fuckin with me so called activist tryna diss me publicly
And they don't even kno where my heart at heart at and I don't even know where 2 start at start at
