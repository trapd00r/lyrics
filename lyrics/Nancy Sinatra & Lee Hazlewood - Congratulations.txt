He was gone two years
Two years that I thought it would never end
Now P.F.C. Williams is just plain Old Jimmy again

But it doesn't make faces to cheer up the children
The way that he used to before
And it doesn't feed pigeons or sing in the shower
And I don't hear his laugh anymore

His face has grown old and his eyes have grown cold
And they tell you of where he has been
Congratulations, you sure made a man out of him

And I know he won't finish that treehouse he's started
A month before he went away
And although he takes me to church every Sunday
He sits there but he doesn't pray

He keeps things in sight like they've got something to hide
I admit it, you did it, you win
Congratulations, you sure made a man out of him
