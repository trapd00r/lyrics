Hey Mark!!
Yeah

Nah, I don’t think so baby
Oh, come on, it’ll be a lot of fun
Yeah?
Oh

(I don’t think I can come)
Ah... This ain’t just any kind of party
(Nah, I think I’ll stay at home)
Ah, oh no... 
It’s gonna be really, really hot
(It’s startin' to sound good)
I’m gonna put you on the spot
(Baby, maybe I should)
And there'll be lots of one on one

Come on and join the fun
(What should I wear?)
I’ll tell you that it
It doesn’t matter what you wear
Cause it’s only gonna be you and me there 

Chorus :
I’m havin' a party
A party for two
I ain’t inviting nobody
Nobody but you

You’ll be sexy in your socks
(We could polish the floors)
In case that anybody knocks
(Let’s lock all the doors)
Yeah, all the things I’m gonna do
(I’m gonna do with you)
I wanna try something new
(I wanna try that too)
I’ll tell you that it
(It doesn’t matter) uh, uh (what I wear)
(Cause it’s only gonna be)
You and me there 

Chorus :
I’m havin' a party
A party for two
I ain’t inviting nobody
Nobody but you
Yeah, you

You’re there

(We're) We’re gonna party hearty
(Just) Just you and me
(Don’t) Don't think about now
(Don’t) Don't even doubt it now
I’m inviting you to a party for two 

Shake it, shake it
(Come on baby) 

All the things I’m gonna do

I wanna try something new with you, ooh
