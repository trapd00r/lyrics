[Verse 1]
I don't think you understand
That what you're doing is not so cool
You think it's funny to mess with my mind
Don't you
You know I like you so you just tease me
You give me just enough to hang on and on
When you're just wasting my time

[Hook]
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time

[Bridge 1]
Do you hear me when I say
Oo oo oo oooh

[Verse 2]
So let me ask you something
Do you think I'm pretty or don't you
Do you wanna get with me or not and now...
Or are you just wasting my time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And what have you got to say
Well things have got to change
See this just isn't right
I don't wanna have to fight
And I think I better go
Cause this ain't working out anymore
And I'm sorry, sorry, sorry

[Bridge 2]
Understand
That what you did was
Just not so cool, baby
You're just not that cool
