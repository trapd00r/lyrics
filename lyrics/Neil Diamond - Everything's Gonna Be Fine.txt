Ooh, babe, you're a hot little number
Waitin' out there on the line
For you, babe, it's a matter of love
And me, it's a matter of time

For us babe, it's a matter decided
Know that I made up my mind
I'm gonna love you, you're gonna love me
And everything's gonna be fine

Ooh, baby, I'm feelin' your heat
Hot as the Fourth of July
Me, I know that your kisses are sweet
And there's something between you and I

And oh, babe, I may look like I'm okay
I'm going out of my mind
'Cause I wanna love you
And if I can love you
And everything's gonna be fine

Ooh, you got to know it
Need a little romance now
And I got to show it
Won't you give me the chance now
Oh yeah, oh yeah...

Ooh, babe, you're a sign on the freeway
Beggin' me please to slow down
But watch out babe,
I'm inclined to believe there's no way
To turn it around.

For us babe, it's a matter decided
Already made up my mind

Ain't gonna hurry, don't gotta worry

Everything's gonna work out just fine...
