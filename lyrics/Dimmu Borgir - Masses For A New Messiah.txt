In massing darkness we stand united  
Raging above inferior sheeps  
A convoy of souls swept into the night  
Hearts strengthened with black fire passion  
In us is fulfilled the prophecy of satan  
Evolution of the inner shrine  
In us is mantained the revelation of satan  
Innocence brought to an end  
In honour of thy unearthly creation  
We bring forth thy divine form  
Vanity throughout any conceptions  
Blazed and bound for the days are coming  
Infernal madness,unholy ascendance  
Christian death abound in mouring perversion  
Cherished sacred icons torn to pieces  
They'll chase the serpent in everlasting nightmare  
Disharmonic illusions of strings bending loose  
Wrapped,penetrating skin  
Listen to the music of their agony  
Eyes made of glass,mirrors within
