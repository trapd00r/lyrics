(Sky Saxon/Daryl Hooper/Jan Savage)
I'm now a man
But why did it take me oh so long
I'm now a man
My mind's floating out toward the sky
This old world always shows me something new
Everytime, girl, I'm with you
I'm now a man
I'm now a man
MY mind's running away wiwith the wind
And each new day I find more rainbows we can play
Don't you find it hard? To keep your feelings in your backyard
I'm now a man
I'm now a man
Well, I want to know what you do
When you're away, away from me
Well I want to know if you feel that way, too
The way that I love you
I'm now a man
I'm now a man
I'm now a man
My world I painted blue over grey
And I have a magic crayon box
Going out and paint out the silver locks
I'm now a man, I'm now a man
Feeling so good inside
And you made me a man
Just to be by your side
I'm now a man,
Oh, now a man
Just the way I walk with you
JUst the way that you talk, too
I'm now a man
Oh, now a man
