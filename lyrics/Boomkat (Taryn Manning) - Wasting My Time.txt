I don't think you understand
That what your doing is not so cool
You think it's funny to mess with my mind
Don't you
You know I like you so you just tease me
You give me just enough
To hang on and on

When your just wasting my time
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time

Do you hear me when I say
So let me ask you something
Do you think I'm pretty or don't you
Do you want to get with me or not

Are you just wasting my time?
You're simply wasting my time
So quit wasting my time

And what have you got to say
Well things have got to change
See this just isn't right
I don't want to have to fight
And I think I better go
'Cause this ain't working anymore
And I'm sorry, sorry, sorry

Understand that what you did
Was just not so cool
Maybe your just not that cool
