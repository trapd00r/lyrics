She'll ask you where you've been
You'll be hours late
When you finally come home
She'll suspect something's wrong
Make sure to erase all your outgoing calls

Why trouble her lonely soul
She doesn't have to know
She doesn't have to know
Why tell her
It would hurt her so
She's such a lonely soul
Such a lonely soul

She'll be watching you for sure
Afraid to find out
What she already knows
And she'll try to stay calm
'Cause you'll be so hard to get to
And she's still in love

Why trouble her lonely soul
She doesn't have to know
She doesn't have to know
Why tell her
It would hurt her so
She's such a lonely soul
Such a lonely soul
