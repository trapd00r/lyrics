I'm in the kitchen, I'm cooking and mixing and fixing the sauces and I'll call you back
Running around in the city, I'm running I like it, I'm busy so I'll call you back
Flipping the switches and bitches come witness that you're in your feelings and I'll call you back
Never the life of the party but I'll get it started this business and I'll call you back

It's business, we've been this
It's business, we've been this and I'll call you back
It's business, it's business
It's business, it's business and I'll call you back
It's business, we've been this
It's business, we've been this and I'll call you back
It's business, it's business
It's business, it's business and I'll call you

Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
And I'll call you back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
