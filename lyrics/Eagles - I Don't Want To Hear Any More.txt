It's not the first time
That I had the sense 
That something's wrong

I'm old enough to know
That things don't always 
Work out like they should

I know you're trying hard
To break it gently to me now
But there's no easy way
To tell it like it is, so baby

I don't want to hear anymore
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

I've seen that look before
I know it well
It comes as no surprise
You've been avoiding me
But now you want to talk it over

Before you take my hand
And tell me softly in a whisper
There's no need to explain
I've read the book
I know how this all ends

I don't want to hear anymore
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way
Look me right in the eye
Let me walk away with my head high

If there's some other guy
I don't need to know why

Well
I don't want to hear anymore
You don't need to tell me it's over
I've been here before

I won't ask you to stay
I won't stand in your way

And I don't want to hear anymore
No, no baby
I don't want to hear anymore
