she's on the cover of a magazine
a show face if you know what I mean
and those eyes so shocking blue (uh-uh)

you're never gonna be her number one
a deadly case of hit and run
she never takes things out of the blue (uh-uh)

and here comes her lover
and she's a first class on the cover
and thats when it all makes sense to you
she just don't belong with you
here comes another
another boy who will discover
and find out what you already knew
she's got a different point of view

she's on the cover and you know her name
sunglasses in the pouring rain
and everyday she wears something new (uh-uh)

you're never gonna be her number one
a deadly case of hit and run
she never takes things out of the blue uh-uh

and here comes her lover
and she's a first class on the cover
and that's when it all makes sense to you
she just don't belong with you
here comes another
another boy who will discover
find out what you already knew
she's got a different point of view
