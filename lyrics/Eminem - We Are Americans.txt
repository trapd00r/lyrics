(Softly Singing)
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phoneline, can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
they gonna hear me, when I shout (heh)

(Verse1)
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail but this time
When I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher
And a Pitbull in the seat, these pigs will get bit foolin' wit' me
Quit foolin' wit' me, bitch you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
And which you're gonna see in the long run, imma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo tinted glass flashin' that flashlight
on my ass, where was you that last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bare arms, what, i'm sposed to fight with bare palms?
Yeah right, they comin with bombs, i'm comin with flare guns
We as Americans

(Chorus)
We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what did we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans

(verse 2)
I'ma make a few bucks, wear a cool vest
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cookoo's nest
But you know who, with a S tattooed to my chest
But I finessed it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it 50/50 on 50 
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin quicker 
Then mankin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money, I don't rap with dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forhead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But i'm too swift and fast for that, i'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot 
Fuck that shit! I dun seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap pap shit that quick
Snap click, but this time I got the fuckin au-to-ma-tic
And no one gon' test this mind, clack click

(chorus)
We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what did we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans

(Verse 3)
I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run in with the long arm of the law, i'm long gone
I'ma do five years, no less then that, no questions asked
What might be a good idea, that I stop right here
And quit while i'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send the task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi but I got my ... mack

(Chorus)
We as Americans, us as a citizen, gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin by any means; We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what did we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
