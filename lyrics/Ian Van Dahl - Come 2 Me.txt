The first time that I saw you
You blew my mind 

You made me take a look inside 
I couldn't hide 

Never thought I could feel this way about someone 

I don't know much about life, but I know you're the one 

Come to me 
Come to me

So come to me
I like to be the one you need 
So come to me 
Then you will see 
what you mean to me 
Please come to me

So come to me
I like to be the one you need 
So come to me 
Then you will see 
what you mean to me 
Please come to me

My heart has been broken 
So many times 

But you turned darkness into light
You made me smile 

Never thought I could feel this way about someone 

I don't know much about life, but I know you're the one 

Come to me 
Come to me

So come to me
I like to be the one you need 
So come to me 
Then you will see 
what you mean to me 
Please come to me

So come to me
I like to be the one you need 
So come to me 
Then you will see 
what you mean to me 
Please come to me
