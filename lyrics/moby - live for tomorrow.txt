As I live, as I live, as I live for tomorrow
While my mind is at rest
While my mind is at rest
It's so easy for sorrow
While my mind is at rest
While my mind is at rest
It's so easy for sorrow

As I live, as I live, as I live for tomorrow
As I live, as I live, as I live for tomorrow
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
While my mind is at rest
While my mind is at rest
It's so easy for sorrow
As I live, as I live, as I live for tomorrow
As I live, as I live, as I live for tomorrow

Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
Feel my heart, it's disturbed
As I live, as I live, as I live for tomorrow
