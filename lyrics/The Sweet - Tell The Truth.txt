In the eyes of the world
You're a rock 'n' roll widow
But where is the girl
That I used to know
Your friends try to blame me
But you know that it's crazy

Tell the truth - I can't take anymore
Tell the truth - I just can't take no more
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose

I gave you my world
And you gave me nothing
But it's never enough
There's always one more thing
Can't stop what I do
It's the only thing that gets me through

Tell the truth - I can't take anymore
Tell the truth - I just can't take no more
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth

Tell the truth - I can't take anymore
Tell the truth - I just can't take no more
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
Or turn - Or turn me lose
Tell - Tell the truth
