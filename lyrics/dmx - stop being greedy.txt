Uh-huh uh-huh
Uh-huh uh-huh
Uh-huh uh-huh
Uh-huh uh-huh

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you, and snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams

All nightmares, the light dares to desert me 
Got me like, everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever 
The closest thing to me's gon' get it, but never

Will I kill I, think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on, till what's left is gone
You could put that on, my nigga Boone
These other rap cats, will give a nigga room

But if it calls for me to force my, way in the door
Head-huntin' mother fuckers so, stay on the floor
Four-four, that's what I get sick with (Grr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (Grr)

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop bein' greedy (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you, and snatch the plate (Uh-huh uh-huh)

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you, and snatch the plate

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uhh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the dog house, leave it a bone

Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch shank and hump, all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin'

But I don't like drama, so I say to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit, and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys, with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got, in big glasses

I'm broke so I'ma bash his, head wide open
Beggin' me to stop but at least, he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else is black

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop bein' greedy (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you, and snatch the plate (Uh-huh uh-huh)

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop bein' greedy (Arf arf)
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy (Arf arf)
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait (Arf arf)
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you, and snatch the plate (Arf arf)

When the sun is up the gun is up, on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me, for they health
Hopin' that they not around, when it gets dark outside
Sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside

Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, and another and another
Gun pops, go into you and your mother

When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats, will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers just stress
Try to hold my head, and remember that I'm blessed

If you curse and it gets worse, as time goes by 
Can't see straight 'cause, I'm so high
Why ask why, when you know
Nigga when it's your time to go, roll

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop bein' greedy (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait (Uh-huh uh-huh)
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you, and snatch the plate (Uh-huh uh-huh)

Y'all been eatin' long enough now stop bein' greedy (Arf arf)
