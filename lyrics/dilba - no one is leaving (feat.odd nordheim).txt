No one is leaving here
Not until we get this clear
I'm tired of all your accusations
Tired of all this pain
Losing all that I hold dear
I demand that you sit down and hear

You tell me that I'm untrue
That i'm breaking your heart in two
You've had enough of my excuses
Say your getting out
But I haven't had my say
It won't hurt you to wait one more day

See I don't have your strength anymore
I don't feel that strong anymore
I don't have your strength anymore
I can't hold back my tears anymore

No one loves you as I
My tears are silent and dry
Through all my counting downs
Plus and minus was never none
And now you wanna share your precious time
Though it hurts me I still think we should try

See I don't have your strength anymore
Can't even feel your pain anymore
I don't have your strength anymore
I can't hold back my tears anymore

No one is leaving now
Not until we worked this out
