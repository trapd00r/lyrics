Lonliness is nothin' new
I've lived with it my whole life through
So look out gloom
I'm makin' room for happy happy

Through with walkin' sadness street
I'm dancin' on these smilin' feet
Oh, blues be gone
I'm turnin' on with happy happy

And should he need me
Well I'll be right there,
I don't care, anywhere

And should he want me 
I'll say this is it, the lamp is lit
Here we go, here we go

Up to where our mind are free
And ev'ryday's philosophy
Says life is wild be like a child
Called happy happy
