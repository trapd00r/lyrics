I miss your smell and your style and your pure abiding way 
Miss your approach to life and your body in my bed 
Miss your take on anything and the music you would play 
Miss cracking up and wrestling our debriefs at end of day 

These are things that I miss 
These are not times for the weak of heart 
These are the days of raw despondence 
I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this 

I miss your neck and your gait and your sharing what you write 
Miss you walking through the front door documentaries in your hand 
Miss traveling our traveling and your fun and charming friends 
Miss our Big Sur getaways and to watch you love my dogs

These are things that I miss
These are not times for the weak of heart
These are the days of raw despondence
I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this

One step, one prayer
I soldier on
Stimulating, moving on 

I miss your warmth and the thought of us bringing up our kids
And the part of you that walks with your stick-tied handkerchief

These are things that I miss
These are not times for the weak of heart 
These are the days of raw despondence
I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this
