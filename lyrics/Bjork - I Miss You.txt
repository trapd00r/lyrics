I miss you
but I haven't met you yet
So special
but it hasn't happened yet
You are gorgeous
but I haven't met you yet
I remember
but it hasn't happened yet

And if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
I will meet you

I was peaking
but it hasn't happened yet
I haven't been given
my best souvenir
I miss you
but I haven't met you yet
I know your habits
but wouldn't recognize you yet

And if you believe in dreams
or what is more important
that a dream can come true
I will meet you

I'm so impatient
I can't stand the wait
When will i get my cuddle?
Who are you?

I know by now that you'll arrive
by the time I stop waiting

I miss you!
