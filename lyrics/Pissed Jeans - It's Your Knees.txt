Ya out with your friends
Pull up in your mums Mercedes benz
Looking super cool
Step out of your ride you got it all

But thats when you close the door
And your jeans get all caught up
In a moment of troubled thoughts
You decide to take em off

You're causing some tension
It got their attention
Theres no need to mention
Baby, that your trousers just fell down
Just keep on walking
And keeping em talking
They'll never know your trousers just fell down
Down, down
Even though your trousers just fell down
Down, down
Even though your trousers just fell down

Got a new belt
You're ready to make all the girls hearts melt
And got some brand new jeans
But they're so hot that you're naked underneath

Then somebody spills your drink
And it looks like you pissed your pants
In a moment of troubled thoughts
You take em off and start to dance

You're causing some tension
It got their attention
Theres no need to mention
Baby, that your trousers just fell down
Do what a man would
N show off your manhood
They'll never know your trousers just fell down
Down, down
Even though your trousers just fell down
Down, down
Even though your trousers just fell down

My trousers drop to my knees
I just feel like free willy
Don't watch the size of me,
Not usually this cold you see
Behold, I'm such a tease,
I bought these jeans from overseas
I thought that they were burberrys
But turns out they were schmurberrys

And I cant get a refund PLEASE!
I cant afford my groceries
And they keep falling to my knees,
When I'm out on a pussy spree.
It went downhill when I was three
When my dad neglected me
And ran away on Christmas eve DRU
Were the midnight beast

You're causing some tension
It got their attention
Theres no need to mention
Baby, that your trousers just fell down
You look like a boy scout
Been caught with his cock out
They'll never know your trousers just fell down
Down, down (whoo)
Even though your trousers just fell down
Down, down (whoo)
Even though your trousers just fell down

Cant run for election
With an erection
Baby when your trousers just fell down

You cant get a peace prize
Showing your piece rise
Baby when your trousers just fell down

Down, down
Even though your trousers just fell down
Down, down
Even though your trousers just fell down
