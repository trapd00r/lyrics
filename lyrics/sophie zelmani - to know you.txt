To know you
Means a lot of things
Lot of love, lot of dreams

You are a world
I can't explore
You're a scene
Got a feeling about
What that's gonna mean

To be around you
Means I can't be there
Got to take my mind
Out of there

To explain you
Means my heart in show
You are the reminder
Of the nothingness
I'm open to
