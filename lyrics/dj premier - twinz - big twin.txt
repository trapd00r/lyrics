Guess Who Will Get 'em
Only A Few Triggas
Bustin Off Like This
With Songs That'll Spew Wisdom
World Premiere, We Came To Abuse
Its A Box Office Smash Hit
A Tom Cruise Picture
First Up, Fly Cars In The Two's
Fitta You With A Used To The Down
Guess Who Get Her?
A Gigalow That The Rapboy Love
From The Place Where Da Slang
And The Rap War Come
Get A Taste Soak It Up
Take It Home And Run
Even The Ying Yang Twins Goin Dumb [Echo]
Yea Buddy Its A Trend Now
Everybody's In Now
The Team Dont Blow, How Else We Gon' Win Now?
Is Mo' Dough Leavin Hatas In The Wind Now
More Franklin Faces So Its More Grids Now
Get On The Web, Write A Friend, Tell A Pen Pal
Tell Em That The Hottest Dude You Heard Has Come Down

[Chorus:]
Im On My Way To The Top See The Sky
When I Blaze In The Drop So Fly
Cant Tame Or Stop Me
Still On The Grind So You Hatas Cant Knock Me
Im On My Way To The Top See The Sky
When I Blaze In The Drop So Fly
Cant Tame Or Knock Me
Still On The Grind So You Hatas Cant Stop Me

[Verse 2:]

The Champ Is Here You See The Tramps In Here
The Beat Knock About To Blow All The Anthem Here
When It Sound Like Fly Raise Yo Hands In The Air
Waitin On Me So They Can Get They Tracks Repaired
Rappers Follow The Flow Like Scope On Target

Soften Up They Tone, Man Look What I Started
Even Them Thugs Who Used To Get On They Hearts
Switch They Flow So They Can Sound Like A Caution

[Chorus]
