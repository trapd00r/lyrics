[Intro: KXNG Crooked]
Sex, Money & Hip Hop
Drum Murder Part 2
C.O.B vs. Everybody
Demetrius

[Verse 1: Demetrius]
Yo, the Yakuza and mafia done possed up
And nigga the five of us
Are the cryptographers for the hip hop photographers
Diabolical autobiographers
All of us coughing up corn
Cause we throwing up a C.O.B you copiers

[Verse 2: Dice]
Put you in a sarcophagus when I chop your esophagus
I'm an ominous optimist
I guess I'm Megatron in this bitch
We can play chicken while you in the tank
I have you lifting weights at lunch time pumping on your brakes

[Verse 3: Kenny]
Find me in your place with your maid humping on her face
Let her get a taste while I lay puffing on a J
High as a hello, I keep a ill beau
Right by my motherfucking side like my elbow

[Verse 4: Julius]
Hi nigga, hello
Rappers come meet Dracula dagger his teeth stabbin' ya
Drink half of ya plasma
My victims sink in a deep sleep thinking that he's havin'
A dream weezing while breathing like people with sleep apnea

[Verse 5: KXNG CROOKED]
Lucci the streets back me up
Literally the realest niggas behind us
While labels are giving niggas vaginas
A sex change in exchange for a record deal
Then dick 'em with a smile that's how they kill niggas with kindness

[Verse 5: Julius]
I got a mental condition
My mentals conditioned to slip into
Mental conniptions whenever spittin' is mentioned
My spit was whipped in the kitchen
It's dope, get you addicted
Your ambition don't exist like bitches who strip for tuition

[Verse 6: Dice]
Yo I'm a glitch in the system my lyricism the kiss of death
I got a crystal clear method of rhyming  call it crystal meth
We can make a mix tape in six days and on the seventh day
You'll be resting in peace, that's when we dig graves

[Verse 7: Demetrius]
Liquid metal metamorphosis my fist'll shift shapes
Into a sword or switchblade to test assorted switch blades
You was born bitch-made, immaculate conception
This editor's Edgar Allen with aggression
I grew up Poe

[Verse 8: Dice]
I'll kill your soul before your ass can get to heaven
Catch you at the crossroads, that's how we crashing intersections
Speaking of traffic accidents I'm fittin' to be trafficking and wreckin'
You get naked with faggots, you toss salad without dressing

[Verse 9: KXNG CROOKED]
You ain't violent without blessing, it's the vatican
You C.O.B. traitors and haters made a Darth Vader out of an Anakin
They panickin', they stiff as a mannequin
Just make a move and become a man again
But I still peel your head quicker than Anacin

[Verse 10: Kenny]
I sit and concoct the wickedest plots, sinister thoughts
Grinning a lot, gripping my Glock, licking my chops
I play garbage man and trash talk, scratched off this black hawk
And make you back off or blow your back off

[Verse 11: Julius]
I blast off nigga don't pass me the hookah
Pass me the ruger it's a rap like pashmina
You the past I'm the future I'm passed Nina Kruger
Toss you off the roof, I'll Pac's last scene in Juice ya

[Verse 12: Demetrius]
Yo ass seen Medusa cause nigga I petrify you
It was meant for me to genocide you nigga it's in the bible
Meant for me to roll up and blaze you
That's why bible pages feel like Zig Zag paper
Nigga I flame ya!

[Verse 13: Kenny]
Not even ya savior can save ya
This gauge'll place you in the past like a pager or Sega
I'll ride your chick like a freeway before I peel off
I'll treat her face like a exit, this where I get off

[Verse 14: KXNG CROOKED]
We can have a spit off
I smack the colostomy bag of a handicapped rapper
If he don't knock the shit off
Cause ya'll so irrelavent
187 I'm sending you to heaven for the hell of it
Everything a square represents
Me and my circle we rebel against
With reckless neglegence
Me and the Horseshoe Gang
We got more chemistry than the periodic table of elements
We flow showing intelligence and eloquence
Still set you up for that cheddar since
You forever snitch
Kill you in your sleep all I need is a clever bitch
Now your bed is drenched when that Beretta's clenched
Smell the stench of a dead rat for dropping dimes for a mere penny
That eleven cents got you hung over the bull
I call it Merryl Lynch
White paint over the face for dead presidents
Ever since we came we been the best, you can't ignore it
But that elephant in the room is prehistoric
