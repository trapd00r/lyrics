Everybody makes mistakes
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not making me wait
But it seems alright as long as something's happening
I try to make you late
But you fight me out like a fighter does
You try making me wait
But it feels alright as long as something's happening

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late
And it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
I try making you wait
And you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try making me wait
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes
But it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
