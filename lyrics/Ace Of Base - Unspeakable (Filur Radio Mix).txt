All I wanna say to you

Oh yeah

I was unfeeling when you discovered me
Gave me a reason to not deny my needs
I was unwilling to give my love away
But you decided to give yours anyway

Oh, I can't express
(Oh, I can't express)
The feelings I possess
For you, baby

All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define
Unspeakable

Oh yeah

Never thought I needed someone to call my own
But now that you've got me, don't ever let me go
You leave me unwanting, you silence every need
Nothing is missing, no love is so complete

Oh, I can't express
The feelings I possess
For you, baby

Oh, yeah

All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define
Unspeakable

Never had this feeling that brings me to my knees
You helped me recover what's been eluding me
You're a sensation that makes my love run free
And now I'm speechless, it's all so clear to me

All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define it
All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't describe it
All I wanna say to you
Is na-na-na-na unspeakable
All I wanna say to you
Words can't define it
Unspeakable, unspeakable, unspeakable, unspeakable,
Unspeakable, unspeakable, unspeakable
