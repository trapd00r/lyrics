Lots of people walk about proud and free
Lift up your head start looking around
There's a brandnew feeling of liberty
Like a clear bell that's starting to sound

Plantation Boy
C'mon and get going
Yesterday's chains have broken in two
Plantation Boy
The new move is growing
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you
Plantation Boy
Plantation Boy

Lots of smiling faces for you to meet
So many hands to help you along
Just shake off the mud that weighs down your feet
If you stand tall you just can't go wrong

Plantation Boy
C'mon and get going
Yesterday's chains have broken in two
Plantation Boy
The new move is growing
Reaching the hills, the valleys and you
Plantation Boy
Plantation Boy

Years of picking cotton for little pay
Living alone in some wooden shack
Sweating in the heat of a summer's day
This is all over, you won't come back

Plantation Boy
C'mon and get going
Yesterday's chains have broken in two
Plantation Boy
The new move is growing
Reaching the hills, the valleys and you
Plantation Boy
Plantation Boy

Plantation Boy
C'mon and get going
Yesterday's chains have broken in two
Plantation Boy
The new move is growing
Reaching the hills, the valleys and you
Plantation Boy
Plantation Boy

Plantation Boy
Plantation Boy
Wherever you may go

Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
Reaching the hills and the valleys and you...
