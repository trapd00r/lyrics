[Hall & Oates (2 Chainz):]
Easy ready willing overtime (Turn that light down for me)
When does it stop, where do you dare me to draw the line?
You got the body now you want my soul (Light that burner, Number 9, Camel)
Don't even think about it, say no go, yeah, ayy
(Yeah)
(We vibin' now)
(Back and back and forth, forth)
(Back and back and forth, forth)
We vibin' now
Back and back and forth, forth
Back and back and forth, forth

[2 Chainz:]
Doin' such a good job, I pat myself on the back
Flight confirmation, I cash through the app
Ain't nobody robbin' me, I answer doors with a strap
Anywhere I go, I put Southside on the map
Shawty said she love me, I said, "I love me back" (Back)
Try to cuss me out, I ain't goin' for that (Bitch)
A nigga said he want my plugs so they can order the packs
But I'm addicted to the trap, you never know I relapse so

[Hall & Oates (2 Chainz):]

I can't go for that, I can't go for that (Yeah)

[2 Chainz:]
I call your phone, you ain't answer yours
I ain't goin' for the bull like a matador (Hmm)
Text me, if I don't reply quick, you trip (Trip)
I'm Jefe, I'm the highest on the list (List)
Kick it like Judo, the numero uno, yes I'm the highness
My house so far back in the woods that can't nobody find us
A driveway so long that you can run out of gas
Keep askin' me for money, you need to get off your ass

[2 Chainz:]
I beat a charge then I bounce back (Oh)
Drop 125 and brought a ounce back (Skrr)
Got the Cognac color on the inside (Inside)
And the Forgiatos covered with the big tires (Big tires)
When your friend come make sure she keep quiet (Shh)
Or the next time I see her I'll be senile (Ooh)
Look around like this must be a mixup (Mixup)
I can't fuck with you if you gonna switch up (Yeah)
