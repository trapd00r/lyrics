Curtain's down, martini's dry
I've come to lift you up somehow
You've spent too many years in this damn town

Years to come and years to go
You'll get none, though it's your show
You've put too many steps on the same ground

You've had your time
You've had your turn
You've had your share
I don't mean to be unfair, but you've got to learn
You only get what you earn

Never heard what your head said
Painted blue, though your thoughts were red
You're still way too tired for your own bed

What's wrong with your appetite
Are you feeling way too full to even have a bite?
How can you see yourself clear, you're out of sight

You've had your time
You've had your turn
You've had your share
I don't mean to be unfair, but you've got to learn
You only get what you earn

Why didn't you care, why were you just lying there?
Why did you let it burst when it could bear?
Why didn't you come, shouldn't you be on the run?
Now your star is crashed and burnt and gone

You've had your time
You've had your turn
You've had your share
I don't mean to be unfair, but you've got to learn
You only get what you earn...
