Ooh!

I told her "Never in hell, no special reason"
Must've lied 'cause I ain't leavin'
We're in for a very long night
Heard a vicious rumor from your mama's tongue
You a desperate woman, need a man with a gun
High crime zone, in the city o' lights

Baby please, can't take it anymore
Ah, baby please, can't take it anymore

I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight
And I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze, uh! Uh!
I hear you're lookin' for somebody to fight
Baby, don't get uptight
Baby, please

Wanna see my ID? Try to clip my wings
Don't have to show you proof o' anything
I know the law, friend
At the 'leventh hour I'm goin' back outside
Mmm, give it a try, I'm your last loose end

Baby please, I can't take it anymore
Oh, baby please, I can't take it anymore

I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight
An' I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze, uh! Uh! Uh!
Hear you're lookin' for somebody to fight
Baby, don't get uptight
Baby, please , yeah!

Oww!

Oooh, baby
Oooh, baby
Oooh, baby

Uh feel my heartbeat
