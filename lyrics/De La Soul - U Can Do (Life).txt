(Whispered)
(Ah, ah)
C'mon, c'mon, bounce - bounce
C'mon... bounce, rock, roll
(Ah, ah)

Chorus: {sung}

You can do, whatever you want
Whatever you like
It's your own life
So let me be, to do what I want
To do what I like
Cause this is my life

(Dove)
It's been about ten long years, my skin wreaks
Flavors that your incense couldn't match
We burn slow like syphillis in your piss, accommodated
With the penicill-in, you're listenin', to
This "Art Official" will keep your shoes moonwalkin'
Soon to talk about, "Pop Music"
You'll buy it cause you choose it
A lot of MC's is really S&M'n
Whips and chains, I maintain like a old jazz singer
Elephants in any location
Held back in rotation, an apple a day
Only makes a nigga fruity
I eat responsibilities to carry out my duty
?? In the MD's, I pull it out just to polish it
Make notes if you earnin' or wait your turnbuckle
I stick to gettin' mines like stucco, stucco (ah, ah)

(Pos)
I'm that full-time rapper, the nickname's Llama
Part-time father if you ask my daughter's mommas
Missin' in action cause the action got a fraction
Of the world listenin' to me
Got 'em travellin' overseas in lands constantly
Got a sea of hands wavin', ain't misbehavin'
But a lot of kids cravin' for somethin' they ain't got
Like the keys to the ride and a pocket with a knot in it
Holdin' they ground till they rot in it
Plottin it, lockin it down strong
'Cause it's nuttin wrong gettin' your bubblin on sticker
But too much bubblin can make you fizz quicker
So watch your stack, keep your fam intact
And pay attention to the now, I'm clearin the mess
While they stressin back in the day, I'm at the front of the night
With my crew shinin light on the (ah, ah)

(Pos)
Now we on top of this like a typical bed position
Peepin your view, got your whole crew wishin and waitin
Makin' dollars out of ten dime pieces
Who be sippin out the glass suckin on the lime pieces included
In my pieces I pen the good livin'
And even when we're stressin from in the hood livin'
At least we're livin' and there ain't no hell in that
Give me a yell in that, and go (ah, ah)

(Dove)
I wanna see the world ten times over
Dive off cliffs and land on oppotunities unthinkable
You sinkin straight to the bottom; while I float in parades
That St. Patty couldn't put up
All my niggaz tryin' to build, then throw your wood up
Design life like PNB gears so stand clear for the blast off
Last off my chest, peace to Dav West
Live your life to the fullest (ah, ah)

(Whispered)
You can do... what you want... what you like
Let me be... what I want... what I like
