(chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg)
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Weather we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special

(verse 1 - The Game)
L.A.X. to J.F.K. thats where it all happened
Caught you walkin out that gucci store in manhattan
I was in chains and cuffs, you was with cha girls
I was in that aftermath chain, you was in pearls
It was me against the world, baby girl
You had dreams of stardom,
The prince of compton meets the queen of harlem
First date at mr chows it was culture i would coach ya
La pearla, gucci, louie, finde, prada, dolce
Runnin circles in my living room, tearing up sofas
Me clear in the rover, fuck it ma lets tear up the highway
Let the sprewells spin till the plates fell off
Then we could go 1 on 1 at dres house
Jeans painted with the waist cut out
You rockin the fly way that lil bit of compton mixed with bed stuy way
And girl im not trying to excite you,
Im tryna wife you, bamboo earing, white air nike you
Yea

(chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg)
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Weather we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special

(verse 2 - The Game)
I like your style, like the way you move, the way you talk
The way you smile, the way you swingin them hips when you walk
The way you look, the way you ride when you workin them thighs
The way you licken your lips when you look in my eyes
You down for me, im down for you
You go down on me, ill go down on you
I wanna do all the things that your man wont do
Im from the hood, so i know how to handle you
Keep you in pink rocks and g-unit canvas shoes
Show you how to gangsta lean when the lambo move
Ill take you to new york city, atlanta too
Show you how to fly them birds and them hammers thru
And you know...

(chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg)
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Weather we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special

(verse 3 - The Game)
Let me tell you bout the birds and bees
How i stand on the block all day and flip birds and keys
Your boyfriend dont like me, cause he dont get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the porsche and his keys
Hop in the range rover, you aint gotta force him to leave
I gotta chrome four four on my jeans
You got gucci frame covering the mark on your face
Cause he dont want you to leave and i dont want you to stay
Sometimes i wanna snatch that nigga out tha CLK
I know he treating you like k-ci did mary j
I wanna ease ya pain, kick off your louie sandles
Let me, whip your tears with my g-unit bandana
Make me wanna peal you out them jeans when you rockin em
Its "me and my girlfriend" like tupac and them
Jay-z and beyonce or bobby and whitney
We the oh 5 bonnie and clyde, you feel me

(chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg)
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Weather we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special
