You count on the birds, you count on the birds,
you count on them to represent your longing.
You count on the birds, you count on the birds,
you count on them to represent your longing.

Suddenly last summer the outdoors has gone warmer.
The sun would go down lo longer.
The birds didn't have to go to Sahara.

You can watch the birds and you can count the birds,
but don't count on them to represent your longing.
You can watch the birds and you can count the birds,
but don't count on them to represent your longing.

The lazy birds move nowhere.
Sitting in a field, flapping their wings.
What fun it is to watch them if they never went.

Been hiding lately. Been out of function.
Been hibernating. Been looking at birds.
Burdened by something I have to get rid of.
Been making myself a better world.

Now please call the boys, please call the boys.
Tell them to put on their dancing shoes now.
Tomorrow will set me off along a thousand roads.
See I make everything new now.

I wannna go, go, go. It's the going I'm after!
I wannna go, go, go. It's the going I'm after!
I wannna go, go, go. It's the going I'm after!
I wannna go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

Oh, look mere Mama, look at the birds.
The movement has moved inward.
The feathers are shaking and the beaks are chattering
Now do you like to watch, like to watch the birds?
Now do you like to watch, like to watch the birds?
Now do you like to watch, like to watch the birds?
Now do you like to watch, like to watch the birds?

Now please call the boys, please call the boys.
Tell them to put on their dancing shoes now.
Tomorrow will set me off along a thousand roads.
See I make everything new now.

I wannna go, go, go. It's the going I'm after!
I wannna go, go, go. It's the going I'm after!
I wannna go, go, go. It's the going I'm after!
I wannna go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
