I know the way you pull in the driveway
And I know the sound, the sound that the dog makes
And your foot steps fall soft on the walk way
I will be waiting

And when you get home, I'm gonna lock you in
I wont let you go, no, I won't let you leave again
And I'll bet you know, yeah that I will be waiting

You know if it's dark that I'll leave the light on
And you know the key is under the rock on the front lawn
And you know how lonely I get when you're gone
Ya know what I'm sayin, I will be waiting

And when you get home, I'm gonna lock you in
I won't let you go, no, I wont let you leave again
And I'll bet you know, yeah that I will be waiting, for you

I miss the way ya fill in the spaces
And I miss us in our favorite places
And I miss you, the way we turn the pages
And I will be waiting

And when you get home, I'm gonna lock you in
I won't let yo go, no I won't let you leave again
And I'll bet you know that I will be waiting
I will be waiting for you, right here
I will be waiting for you
I will be waiting
