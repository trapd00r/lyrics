Hold on now, hold on now
It's all so clear
Our circles followed me to here
I'm cradled in unhappiness
We're not the same
You swore it wouldn't be like this

Love won't spend it's days like this
Trapped in loneliness
Wrapped in solitude
Without having you

I can't feel you
Can't get near you
Walk right through you
I can't feel you
We're so arrested
I'm still invested now
Can't come near you
I can't feel you

I'm trapped inside
This shell you own
I taste my fears
And suddenly it reappears
You still live inside of me
Walking through my dreams
You always disappear
But I'm still here
