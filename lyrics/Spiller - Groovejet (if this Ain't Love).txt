Holding you closer
It's time that I told you
Everything's going to be fine
Know that you need it
And try to believe it
Take me one step at a time

If this ain't love
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
Why does it feel so good?

If this ain't love
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
Why does it feel so good?

Think of tomorrow
We beg, steal or borrow
To make all we can in the sun
While we are moving
The music is soothing
Troubles we thought had begun

If this ain't love
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
Why does it feel so good?

If this ain't love
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
Why does it feel so good?

Will you remember me, boy
Remember me loving you

Just for this lifetime
You can be my pastime
Here are the rules of our play
In it together
'Till I know you better
Darling
Darling, now what do you say?

If this ain't love
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)

(Now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
Why does it feel so good?
(Now)
(Now)
(Now)

If this ain't love
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
(Why does it feel now)
Why does it feel so good?

If this ain't love
(Now)
(Now)
(Now)
Why does it feel so good?
