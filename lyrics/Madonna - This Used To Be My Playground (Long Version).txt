This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

Don't look back, keep your head held high
Don't ask them why, because life is short
And before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

No regrets
But I wish that you were here with me
Well then, there's hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy

This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me

This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me
