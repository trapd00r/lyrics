I had a dog he was a mix
he loved me like a God
But I was just a kid
the kind mother likes
Now I'm big like the sky
and I'm down-sized inside
I'll put this all to rest
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm getting all depressed
I'm just a baby that looks like a boy

I got my father's sense
and my big brother's pants
and I look like a man
and I feel like an ant

just a speck on the ground
growing like a weed
a fleck of a seed

I'll put my hand in flames
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
feels like I'm born again
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy

and I'll keep hanging from your hair 
and I'll keep playing in the sand
Just as long as I can
