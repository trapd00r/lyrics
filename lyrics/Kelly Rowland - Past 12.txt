Past Twelve - Kelly Rowland

Da-da-da-da-da.
It's past twelve...
Put it on lock...
Show me what you got...
Da-da-da...
Da-da-da...

I met this guy.
He was always on the floor,
But he's dancin' by himself.
I don't know why.
'Cause he's lookin' hot to death.
So I...
Began to think.
If I go out on the floor
There's a chance he'll notice me.
And when he did,
It was on and poppin' sweet.

We get out on the floor
And we take it slow.
Baby, won't you keep it right there.
Yeah, take it there.
Oh I don't really care.
It's all good with me.

We bounce up in the club.
Or kick it in your truck.
As long as it's sittin' on doves--
It's love.
'Cause we ain't gotta go nowhere.
Let's get it krunk right here. Yeah.

It's past twelve o'clock
And I'm tryin' to put it on lock.
Makin' sure the party don't stop.
Bottles stay popped.
Think I'm feelin' what you got,
All night.

It's past twelve o'clock
And I'm tryin' to keep it on lock.
Won't you come and dance with me?
Then we'll see...
If you're gonna be with me.

I must admit
That I'm not too bold
When it comes to other guys.
I ain't gon' trip.
First time for everything.
And I hope that this
Is a thing I won't regret
When morning comes.
When the party ends...
Is it gonna be you and me?

We get out on the floor
And we take it slow.
Baby, won't you keep it right there.
Yeah, take it there.
Oh I don't really care.
It's all good with me.

We bounce up in the club.
Or kick it in your truck.
As long as it's sittin' on doves--
It's love.
'Cause we ain't gotta go nowhere.
Let's get it krunk right here. Oh no.

It's past twelve o'clock
And I'm tryin' to put it on lock.
Makin' sure the party don't stop.
Bottles stay popped.
Think I'm feelin' what you got,
All night.

It's past twelve o'clock
And I'm tryin' to keep it on lock.
Won't you come and dance with me?
Then we'll see...
If you're gonna be with me.

Boy if the feeling's right
We can rock all night.
For sure.
Don't you know that...
Boy, when the clock strikes two--
I'm gon' be with you.
For sure.

It's past twelve o'clock
And I'm tryin' to put it on lock.
Makin' sure the party don't stop.
Bottles stay popped.
Think I'm feelin' what you got,
All night.
