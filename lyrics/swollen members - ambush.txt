(Moka Only)
I'm Pyschosimatic you might know the static that automatically comes when we hit these drums
All of the underworld sayin' here he comes
To snatch back the crown and that's passed around
In my fleet we beat the odds, meet the godfathers
We keep the crowd hotter you speak and why bother
I automata Fire my style I gotta
I got a moniker that's volitile its flow torch
?
?
I'm not the type to sit around on bar stools
Me and the mic we been around since carpools
And now with the 90's behind me I finally designed the epitamy of grimey
You can finally wear the sunshine betry me and I'll have you all crying why me

Ambush, Takin' it back to the place we made the name known and there's no survival
Ambush, We never seen this shit comin' and we want you to know we still hold the title
We still hold the title, there's no survival y'all should get bide
We Strike Without Warning, Show no Remorse, We Run the Darkside

(Madchild)
Dangerous and Uncivilized balls brains jaws chains that's how I'm livin' life
Role Reversal I'll go commercial then go back to underground wit no rehearsal
Roads are closed 'cause boulders rollin', I'm'a bulldoze and my shoulder's frozen
Coldblooded and coldhearted I'm cut throat, I'm gon finish what I started whassup bro
Redeem my Team raps cap'll regeme, Captain of the makin' and happeh machine
Bossaball bosses you, cut your losses
Catch what your tossed and I'm fuckin' awesome
My luck I'll Profit
Of course I'm on my own dick its attached can't get off it
Jack Move Hidin under the Stair Case
Army Fatigued Strap Gas Mask and Bear Mace

(Prevail)
We Discovered the Brotherhood of the Wolves
Where we cut 'em good and feed 'em to the dogs
I'm involved
Mysteries unsolved
The opening groups on cool tell me when its ours
I'm'a treat it like a gymnasium
Goin' 2 times platinum we only play to win
I can't hold again, I'm Spinnin out of orbit
I'm Comin' for ya
If I can plan it like I fought for it
Metamorphic, Something Metal in my Pocket
Turn of gum I'll make you knife an slice an eye socket
Got advice like crock it in tubs
Got you higher then the drugs that they made in bathtubs
Ambush'll push through with muscle
Push come to shove I got you seein double
Purest Shock Value my Corps C4's
Like crawling through a trench in the 2nd world War
