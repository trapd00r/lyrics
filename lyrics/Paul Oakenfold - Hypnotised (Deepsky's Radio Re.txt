You came in from the darkness and held the door open wide
You stood there like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I believe in what I see and also what I hear
But did the night play tricks on me or were you really there.

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised

Fear has gripped my heart and I am whispering out your name 
Can you hear the silence screaming do they sound the same

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised

You came in from the darkness and held the door open wide
You stood there like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I believe in what I see and also what I hear
But did the night play tricks on me or were you really there.

Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised
Am I being Hypnotised 
Feeling like I'm Hypnotised
