I threw away my phone 
I thought that you should know 
I'd throw away my home 
If I had somewhere to go 
Anything's a stop 
The circle in my brain 
Anything is better than you making me feel lame 

28 days to kick a habit 
28 days to let you go 
28 days and I'll be on my own 

All my life I've been sorry for something 
Something gets me nothing 
And nothing's such a waste 
All this time I've been saying I'm sorry 
Why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes? 

I've had enough of you 
Please forget my name 
I'm running round on empty 
But still trying to get away 
Anything to kill the cautiousness of you 
Anything to rid myself of all of the abuse 

28 days to kick a habit 
28 days to let you go 
28 days and I'll be on my own 

All my life I've been sorry for something 
Something gets me nothing 
And nothing's such a waste 
All this time I've been saying I'm sorry 
Why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes? 

Now you know what it feels like to bite your tongue 
Now you'll know what it feels like to be the one 
Who walks around with knots in his stomach 
I've been there and I've done it 
And know you'll know what it feels like to be afraid of everything you wanted to say 
Who's sorry now? 
Who's sorry now? 
Who's sorry now? 

All my life I've been sorry for something 
Something gets me nothing 
And nothing's such a waste 
All this time I've been saying I'm sorry 
Why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes? 

All my life I've been sorry for something 
Something gets me nothing 
And nothing's such a waste 
All this time I've been saying I'm sorry 
Why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes? 

Who's sorry now?
