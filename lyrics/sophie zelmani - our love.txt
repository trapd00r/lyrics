To leave somebody like you made me crazy
Sometimes you don't wanna know what hearts can do
To leave you was the way to get happy
To leave your love was what I had to do

I know that some places some moments will throw a light upon our faces
And there will be no times I wish I had no scar
And those little hands we're holding together
That's our love

That's our love
That's our love

To save her from you was a thought too hard to imagine
And I understand that some feelings really are gone
But maybe you can feel it when we're hugging
That is something he's left I wouldn't mind to stay strong

And we've got a heart that won't ever leave us broken
That's our love, that's our heart

That's our love
That's our love

That's our love
That's our love
