Joseph Hathaway, Charles Kingsley 

Down deary down
There was a knight and he was young a-riding along the way Sir
And there he met a lady fair among the stacks of hay Sir
Down deary down

Quote he shall you and I, Lady among the grass lay down oh
And I will take a special care of the rumpling of your gown oh
So she told him
If you will go along with me into my father's hall Sir
You shall enjoy my maiden's head and my estate and all Sir
Down deary down

So he mounted her on a milk white steed himself upon another
And then they rid upon the road like sister and like brother
Down deary down down deary down
And when they came to father's home all moulded all about Sir
She stepped straight within the gate and shut the young man out Sir
Down deary down

Here is a pursue of gold she said take it for your pain Sir
And I will send my father's men to go home with you again Sir
And if you meet a lady fair as you go by the town Sir
You must not fear the dewy grass or
The rumpling grass of her gown Sir
Down deary down down deary down

And if you meet a lady gay as you go by the hill Sir
Here is the moral of the story
If you will not when you may you shall not when you will Sir
