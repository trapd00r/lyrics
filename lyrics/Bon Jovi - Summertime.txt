Feels something like summertime
Top down and nothing but time
Radio's on and you by my side
Feels something like summertime

These days life goes like this
Wake up, check that off of some list
Gotta be a little something more than this
At the bottom of my coffee cup

I keep a postcard in the back of my mind
Of white sand, sunshine
And you shining like a brand new dime
That's keeping me from giving up
Thinking like I've had enough

You make me
Feel something like summertime
Top down and nothing but time
Radio's on and you by my side
Feels something like summertime

Like that first slow dance and that first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine
It feels something like summertime

Sum-sum-summertime

I was a warm breeze with a cool tan
Life mapped out on the back of my hand
When God was laughing I was making plans
But He didn't laugh when I found you
If there's a heaven baby you're the proof

You make me
Feel something like summertime
Top down and nothing but time
Radio's on and you by my side
Feels something like summertime

Like that first slow dance and that first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better then this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine
It feels something like summertime

Sum-sum-summertime

Feels something like summertime
Top down and nothing but time
Radio's on for me and my valentine
It's like that first slow dance and that first long kiss
There ain't nothing baby better than this
It's like a beach blanket and a bottle of wine (yeah)

Feels something like summertime
Top down and nothing but time
Radio's on and you by my side,
It feels something like summertime
Just like summertime

Sum-sum-summertime
Feels something like summertime
