Arf arf
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Grrrr)
Uh, yeah don't get it twisted
This rap shit, is mine, motherfuckers
It's not, a fuckin', game
Fuck what you heard
It's what you hearin'
It's what you hearin' (Listen)
It's what you hearin' (Listen)
It's what you hearin' (Listen)

X gon' give it to ya
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door it's real
With the non-stop pop-pop, from stainless steel

Go hard gettin' busy wit it
But I got such a good heart, that I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right, and I'll do it again
'Cause I am right, so I gots to win

Break bread with the enemy
No matter how many cats I break bread with, I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved, (Bitch) and that's for the light day

I'm gettin down, down
Make it nigga said freeze
But won't be the one endin' up on his knees Bitch
Please, If the only thing you cats did was came out to play
Stay out my way
Motherfucker

First we gonna, rock, then we gonna, roll
Then we let it POP, DONT LET IT GO
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
[Repeat Once]

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gave nothin to me
But everytime I turn around
Cats got they hands out wantin something from me
I ain't got it so you can't get it
Lets leave it at that cuz I ain't wit it
Hit it wit full strength
I'm a jail nigga
So I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever
What the fuck you gon do?
I'm a Wolf in Sheeps clothing
Only nigga that you know that can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears
I put in work and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is (UH-HUH!)
They don't know who we be
Lookin! but they don't know who they see
Nigga

[Chorus: DMX]
First we gonna ROCK,Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, DONT LET IT GO
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
[Repeat Once]

[Verse 3]
Aiiyo where my Niggaz at?!

Give em love and they give it back
Talk to much for to long (What?!)
Don't give up your to strong (What?!)
Dog to the wow wow hunnies
Shoutout to niggaz that done it
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about gettin down for what you stand for yo

[Chorus: DMX]
For First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, DONT LET IT GO
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
[Repeat Twice]
