Sitting by the telephone
Something isn't right
Staring into nowhere
Blinded by the light

I don't know what you're thinking
I don't know what to do
But I will be waiting right here for you

I'm going nowhere every night
I'll wait for you to make it right
I'm going crazy deep inside
I need your love, I need it tonight

I'm going nowhere every night
I'm waiting by the candlelight
I hear a voice from deep inside
I hear it's you, I feel it's right

Sitting by the telephone
Something isn't right
Staring into nowhere
Blinded by the light

I don't know what you're thinking
I don't know what to do
But I will be waiting right here for you

I'm going nowhere every night
I'll wait for you to make it right
I'm going crazy deep inside
I need your love, I need it tonight

I'm going nowhere every night
I'm waiting by the candlelight
I hear a voice from deep inside
I hear it's you, I feel it's right
