I see problems down the line
I know they're not mine
Don't wash the dirt off of your hands
You're doing the same mistake twice
Making the same mistake twice

Come on over, don't be so caught up
It's not about compromising

I see problems down the line
I know they're not mine

I see darkness down the line
I know it's not fine
But don't wash the dirt off of your hands
You're doing the same mistake twice
Making the same mistake twice

Come on over, don't be so caught up
It's all about colonizing

I see problems down the line
I know they're not mine

Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
Don't let the darkness eat you up
