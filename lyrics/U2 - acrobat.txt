Don't believe what you hear
Don't believe what you see
If you just close your eyes
You can feel the enemy

When I first met you, girl, you had fire in your soul
What happened to your face of melting snow?
Now it looks like this
And you can swallow or you can spit
You can throw it up or choke on it
And you can dream, so dream out loud
You know that your time is coming 'round
So don't let the bastards grind you down

No, nothing makes sense
Nothing seems to fit
I know you'd hit out
If you only knew who to hit

And I'd join the movement
If there was one I could believe in
Yeah, I'd break bread and wine
If there was a church I could receive in
'Cause I need it now

To take a cup
To fill it up
To drink it slow
I can't let you go

I must be an acrobat 
To talk like this and act like that
And you can dream, so dream out loud
And don't let the bastards grind you down

Oh, it hurts, baby
(What are we going to do now, it's all been said)
(No new ideas in the house and every book has been read)


And I must be an acrobat
To talk like this and act like that
And you can dream, so dream out loud
And you can find your own way out

You can build, and I can will
And you can call, I can't wait until
You can smash and you can seize
In dreams begin responsibilities
And I can love
And I can love
I know that the tide is turning 'round
So don't let the bastards grind you down
