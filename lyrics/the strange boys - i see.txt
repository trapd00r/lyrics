See Boy Strange on the
horizon of love
He's calling to you
What do you say?

See Boy Strange as an
example of youth
so close to the truth
but still far away

And he's such a strange boy
will he make a good
exchange for
the one before a closed door
that you left behind?

When you realise that this boy
is strange
it's too late to change
your point of view

He's often there when the
sun meets the sky
with a perfect alibi
unlike you

And he's such a strange boy
D'you think he'll make a good
exchange for
the one before a closed door
that you left behind?

To talk of common sense is a
complete waste of time
His looks are a crime
bound to commit

In the eyes of the world he's
a borderline fool
both naive and cruel
Why would you inflict
him on you?
