I've been bounced around
But I'm still standing up
I've been so far down
That my ears they popped
And it was then I knew
By all the wrongs you do
- That if you can't be good - Be careful!
To achieve your happiness
On this terrestrial ball...
Gotta have a clean conscience
But even better: None at all!
But if you can't be good - Be careful yeah!

It's when a pat on the back becomes a slap in your face now...
Don't look back just helpyourselfish.
And when your friends begin to lose their way...
Don't look back just helpyourselfish...
Yeah, it's easy to be hard, if we got everything now
Don't look back just helpyourselfish...
Through the revolving door on someone elses push
Yeah it's easy to be hard Easy to be hard...

In between those who've got it made
- And those who've got to wait...
Yeah, I'll offer you a chair
But when you sit down - It isn't there!
Always quick to lend a hand
Sorry - Not today I can't...
But I'm always there when I need you - yeah!

It's when a pat on the back becomes a slap in your face now...
Don't look back just helpyourselfish.
And when your friends begin to lose their way...
Don't look back just helpyourselfish...
Yeah, it's easy to be hard, if we got everything now
Don't look back just helpyourselfish...
Through the revolving door on someone elses push
Yeah it's easy to be hard Easy to be hard...
Yeah, when a pat on the back becomes a slap in your face now
And when your friends begin to lose their way
Don't look back - just helpyourselfish
Through the revolving door on someone elses push
Yeah, it's easy to be hard Yeah, yeah easy to be hard...
