Paulina - she's on the cover of a magazine
Paulina - a woman in my nightly dreams
Paulina - who makes me grin in any pose
Paulina - I wish she'd take off all her clothes 

Paulina - well I stare at her pictures all day long
Paulina - and as I do I sing this song
Paulina - my father says to act my age
Paulina - as I single handedly turn the page

Paulina - well I paste her pictures on the wall
Paulina - sit by the phone and hope she'll call
Paulina - although I know she never will
Paulina - to indulge myself is such a thrill

Paulina - she's the big red apple of my eye
Paulina - I wish she'd lay down by my side
Paulina - but if she ever knew my pursuit
Paulina - she would probably file a huge lawsuit

Yeah yeah oh oh oh oh
