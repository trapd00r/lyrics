Ladies and gentlemen
To those among you who are easily frightened
We suggest you turn away now
To those of you who think they can take it
We say, welcome to the Mad House

(Mad House)
Come on, come on, come on in
Come on, come on, come on in

(Mad House)
(Welcome to the Mad House)
Come on, come on, come on in
Come on, come on, come on in
