And my fat Tim stays on my feet (on my feet, what, yeah)
I never smile when someone's around (huh, what)
I'm low key, staying harcore (hardcore, hardcore, huh)

But the hiphop that y'all can feel (hiphop, hiphop, huh)

'Cause I'm a hiphopper, yes, I am (yes, I am, what, yes, I am, huh)
'Cause I'm a hiphopper, yes, I am

'Cause I'm a hiphopper, yes, I am (yes, I am, what, yes, I am, huh)

(Me and my crew, what, Natural Born, what)
