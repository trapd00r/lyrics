Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rawhide!
H'yah! H'yah!

Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Though the streams are swollen
Keep them doggies rollin', rawhide!
Through rain and wind and weather
Hell bent for leather
Wishing my girl was by my side
All the things I'm missin'
Good vit'tles, love and kissin'
Are waiting at the end of my ride

Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em I'm
Let 'em out, cut 'im out, ride on in, rawhide!
H'yah! H'yah!

Keep movin', movin', movin'
Though they're disapprovin'
Keep them doggies movin', rawhide!
Don't try to understand 'em
Just rope and throw and brand 'em
Soon we'll be living high and wide!
My heart's calculatin'
My true love will be waitin'
Be waiting at the end of my ride

Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em in
Let 'em out, cut 'em out, ride 'em in, rawhide!
H'yah! H'yah!

Rawhide!
H'yah! H'yah!
Rawhide!
