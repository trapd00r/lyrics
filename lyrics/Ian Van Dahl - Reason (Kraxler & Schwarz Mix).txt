I think it's time to talk with you
I think it's time to realize
Where is the love?

Are we gonna stay together
Or is it time to say goodbye
Where is the love?

Give me a reason
To hold on to what we've got
There Must be a reason
To hold on to what we've got

Time has come to set things right
Is it worth another fight
Tell me the truth

Is there something on your mind
Tell me what you hide inside
Tell me the truth

Give me a reason
To hold on to what we've got
There Must be a reason
To hold on to what we've got

Are there things that I should know
Will you stay or will you go?
Where is the love?

Tell me is there hope inside?
Gotta read between the lines
Where is the love?

Give me a reason
To hold on to what we've got
There Must be a reason
To hold on to what we've got
There must be a reason
To hold on to what we've got

Give me a reason
