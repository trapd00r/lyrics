dont smoke dont drink
all I do is think
about the lifelines hard times
trying to be kind such a drama plaver
trying to amuse myself

beats and waves will take me to my grave
and when I go there I know that I won't be alone
cus' I've been spoted blotted
mini many times before

eased and pleased released from my shive
i will be flying above the hatered and the loveing
and if you see me honey
you had better blink your eyes

strange how lines blur into one
blend with me and have some fun
trance and wind to blow our mind
this is the way to expand the time

trouble comes in many forms
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Wander, no more

walking out of the circle
step by step i'm learning alone
that I can conqure my demons
just need to remember my home

there's no need to be frightened
we all already are dead
but yet our unending vibration
danger lurks only in my head

come break through with me
such wonders terrify the soul
its real, no need to question
knowledge infiltrates the whole

lightning striks in the darkes places
On mane padme hum"
threatened we have to make choices
lizards try to tell us wich one

strange how lines blur into one
blend with me and have some fun
Trance and Wind to blow our mind
this is the way to expand the time

trouble comes in many forms
I'll show you mine if you show me yours

strange how lines blur into one
blend with me and have some fun
Trance and wind to blow our mind
this is the way to expand the time

trouble comes in many forms
I'll show you mine if you show me yours

don't smoke dont drink
all I do is think
about the lifelines hard times
trying to be kind such a drama plaver
trying to amuse myself

beats and waves will take me to my grave
and when I go there I know that I won't be alone
cus' I've been spoted blotted
mini many times before

eased and pleased released from my shive
I will be flying above the hatered and the loveing
and if you see me honey
you had better blink your eyes.
