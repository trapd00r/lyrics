Give up
If you wanna survive
Get oh so alive
In your life
Everything falling out the sky on top of you
Now what you do? 

Fill yourself up now
It's the love of your life
Shallowly on me
All I know
Before it's gone
I always feel it's getting you down
When nothing's wrong 

What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Me... 

Give up
If you wanna survive
Pick the sound back up
You got to get on the song lowly
What's the point
It's funny 'til you left to kill yourself
In this town 

So what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Me...
