I remember smelling smoke, I woke up I was choking
Lorrie grabbed the baby and we made it safe outside
She never missed a note, took a breath and cleared her throat
And wrapped him in a Carhart coat she found out in my ride
Next thing I remember, I was barefoot in December
When I hit the door again it really came alive
That was all she wrote, in a 30 second note
I got out with a photograph and my old auto 5

Lord knows that I've been blessed
I can stand up to the test
I can live on so much less, this much I been learning
Feeling a pounding in my chest
I'm fearful I'll confess
How am I to get my rest? The house I built is burning

Well Lorrie called the volunteers, siren music to my ears
First I been glad to hear the flashing red and blue
Can't repay the time they gave, there was nothing left to save
Shake all of their hands and wave they did all they could do

Lord knows that I've been blessed
I can stand up to the test
I can live on so much less, this much I been learning
Forgive my cowardice
I'm fearful I'll confess
How am I to get my rest? The house I built is burning

We snuck away two nights ago, rode around the logging roads
We been stuck in a motor home about to fall apart
We finally made a go, got dealt a heavy blow
She said I'll bet you make it, its a long way from your heart

Well I know that I've been blessed
I can make more out of less
I can get my rest in any bed that I lay down in
Got nothing holding me
Got a couple memories
A picture of the three of us, and my grandfather's Browning
