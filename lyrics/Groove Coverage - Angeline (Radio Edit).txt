The last time ever she saw him
Carried away
by a moonlight shadow
he passed on worried and warning
carried away
by a moonlight shadow
lost in a river last saturday night
far away on the other side
he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
and she couldn't find how to push trough

Four a.m. in the morning
carried away
by a moonlight shadow
i watch your vision forming
carried away
by a moonlight shadow
star was glowing in a silvery light
far away
on the other side
will you come to talk to me this night
but she couldn't find how to push through
