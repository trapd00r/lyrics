I could say that I'll always be here for you
But that would be a lie and quite a pointless thing to do
And I could say that I'll always have feelings for you
But I've got a life ahead of me and I'm only 22

Since you've gone I've lost a chip on my shoulder
Since you've gone I feel like I've gotten older
And now you're gone it feels as if the whole wide world is my stage
And now you're gone it's like I've been let out of my cage

You always made it clear that you hated my friends
You made me feel so guilty when I was running 'round with them
And everything was always about being cool
And now I've come to realise there's nothing cool about you at all

Since you've gone I've lost a chip on my shoulder
Since you've gone I feel like I've gotten older
And now you're gone it feels as if the whole wide world is my stage
And now you're gone it's like I've been let out of my cage

Since you've gone I've lost a chip on my shoulder
Since you've gone I feel like I've gotten older
And now you're gone it feels as if the whole wide world is my stage
And now you're gone it's like I've been let out of my cage
