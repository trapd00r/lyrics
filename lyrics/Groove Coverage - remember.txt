Strophe I:

Pain is rising, deep inside,
I've been dying, I've been trying...
Call my name in lonely nights
and where the love goes is where  the wind blows.

I can remember all the things that you said,
will I remember can I remember?
I see emotion in your eyes,
will I remember can I remember?

Strophe II:

Loneliness is killing me...
I've been dying, I've been trying...
Live your life and let mine be,
cause where the love goes is where the wind blows.

I can remember all the things that you said,
will I remember, can I remember?
I see the motion in your soul,
will I remember, can I remember?

Refrain:

If I was just a sailor could I sail without a boat?
If I ever had a harbour I would never loose my hope...
Will you turn my inspiration will you turn the world with me?
If I ever had a harbour I would be the deepest sea!
