[Verse 1] 
Now little Lisa is only 9 years old 
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold 
Why shes all all alone and they never met her family 
Mamas always gone and she never met her daddy 
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listenin' 
Mama is on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen 
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night 
Startin' with laughs--usually endin' in a fight 
Sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out 
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch' 
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her 
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her 
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own 
Forced to think that hell is a place called home 
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack 
She says shes 'bout to run away and never come back.

[Verse 2] 
Little Nicole is only 10 years old 
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold 
Why shes not pretty and nobody seems to like her 
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her 
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises 
Teachers ask questions she makin' up excuses 
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out 
There's only one girl really knows what she about 
Her name is lil' Stacy and they become friends 
Promise that they always be tight till the end 
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot 
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block 
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own 
Forced to think that hell is a place called home 
Nothin else to do but some get her clothes and pack 
She says shes 'bout to run away and never come back.

[Verse 3] 
Little Erica is eleven years old 
Shes steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold 
So she pops x to get rid of all the pain 
Cause shes havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen 
Emotions run deep and she thinks shes in love 
So theres no protection hes usin' no glove 
Never thinkin' bout the consequences of her actions 
Livin' for today and not tomorrows satisfaction 
The days go by and her belly gets big 
The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid 
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion 
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion 
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own 
Forced to think that hell is a place called home 
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack 
She say shes 'bout to run away and never come back.
