Choices always were a problem for you
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to use you
Like me, like me

If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me
Don't judge or question
You are broken now but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand upon you

My Gods will becomes me
When He speaks out, He speaks through me
He has needs like I do
We both want to rape you

Jesus Christ, why don't You come save my life
Open my eyes and blind me with Your light
And Your lies
