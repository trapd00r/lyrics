They try in vain our minds to chain
They try in vain our minds to chain

I'm up in the stars
Looking down at the gutter
When I'm good I'm very good
But when I'm bad I'm better

Oh barman, fill this glass again
And keep on pouring 'til death says when
Oh barman, fill it to the top
And we'll be drinking 'til the singing has to stop

They try in vain our minds to chain
They try in vain our minds to chain

A B C D E F G
The only notes that matter
When I'm good I'm very good
But when I'm bad I'm better

Oh barman, fill this glass again
And keep on pouring 'til death says when
Oh barman, fill it to the top
And we'll be drinking 'til the singing has to stop

They try in vain our minds to chain
They try in vain our minds to chain
They try in vain our minds to chain

Me and all my friends are comming 'round to your house
And were not going to go until we get thrown out
Me and all my friends are comming 'round to your house
And were not going to go until we get thrown out
Me and all my friends are comming 'round to your house
And were not going to go until we get thrown out
Me and all my friends are comming 'round to your house
And were not going to go until we get thrown out

Oh barman, fill this glass again
They try in vain our minds to chain
Oh barman, fill this glass again
They try in vain our minds to chain
Oh barman, fill this glass again
They try in vain our minds to chain
