[Chorus - Danny]
Lights out
You're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth
Who the fuck are you now?
Lights out
Can you feel it now?
We're calling you out
Who the fuck are you now?

[J-Dog:]
Lifestyles of the young and the reckless
Checked in the real world that don't ask questions
Dodging 'em bullets like a fucked up western
Dragged you on a rope til you're choked out senseless
Kings or crown we're the best around
Got an underground army yeah we holding it down
We built our base and what we found
It takes blood and sweat and always moving a crowd
No skill then you're going the fast way
Let me see you dance one from the A.K.
Bullshit now he's dropping names, who you know, what you do it all sounds the same
A piece of advice quit dropping mine
You'll be gone way before it even it is your time
Like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage
You'll be gone like a dollar bill hitting the stage

[Chorus]

[Charlie Scene:]
I'm gonna wake your ass up 'cause you ain't got what it takes
Your crew's right on my nuts so tell you how my dick tastes
Yeah I'm shit faced and all black looking creepy
It's Charlie Scene this shit is way too easy
I'ma give it to you quick going straight to your throat
Put the burner in your mouth and turn you in to a ghost
All these people making music with nothing to show
Who doesn't have a band? Shit I don't know
What kind of sane person drops his own name
What kind of sane person boos his own band off stage
What kind of sane person drops a verse like this
These damn meds ain't working I'm just too damn sick
Just you coming out here's got me provoked
Now I'm gonna cut your ass up like a line of coke
I'mma roll your crew up like a fat ass roach
And put you in my ash tray 'cause you just got smoked

[Chorus]

[Danny & Funny Man:]
Another classic case you crash and burn

[Funny Man:]
And it's true you're dead wrong
It's lights out, your last song

[Danny:]
The world has turned its face you'll never learn

[Funny Man:]
And it's true you're dead wrong
It's light out, your last song

[Danny:]
Walls are closing in, they're falling down

[Chorus]

Lights out
You're talking too loud
Who the fuck are you now?
Who the fuck are you now?
Lights out!
