Is it you? [x3]

I guess you always
Wanted freedom
No guarantees
In the western world
Love forsaken
My heart is aching
You turned to east
To find your peace

(My everlasting dream)

Black Sea, what do I see?
(This) glimmer on the ocean, (is it you?)
Black sea for you and me
(So) close but far away
Na, na, na, na ? Can there be a chance?
Na, na, na, na ? For you and me
Na, na, na, na ? Feel my humble stance
You're my Swedish complete taboo

(My everlasting dream)

My enigma is
Keeping our secret
Cross my heart
And hope to die

Dream dynamic
So panoramic
When yearning wail
My endless tale

(My everlasting dream)


I guess you always
Wanted freedom
No guarantees
In the Western World
Love forsaken
My heart is aching
You turned to east
To find your peace

I hear waves are roaring in
Birds are crying loud
My adoring sin
I'm standing here so proud
Why?
