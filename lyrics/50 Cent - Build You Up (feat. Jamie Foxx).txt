Yeah uh huh
I like the way that feel)

I built you up, what
If ever I fall down
N' I need you to pick me up
Promise me you be around
Hold me down
I build you up

Listen if you let me, I'll b the reason you shine
It's a secret, I want the world to know dat you mine
But on sum real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writin' this song instead of a love letter.
They gon play it on da radio a hundred times a day
I figure, when you hear it, you gon stop 'n' think of me
I wanna get to know you, and b the reason you Smile
Girl you know where I'm from, you know how I get Down
When times are tough, tell me dat I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, dat I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girls best friend
Precious stones, could you put me befo' them
If so, I'll see to it dat they'll always around
Nothin', but da best, now how does dat sound
If I drop a jewel when we talk, you can keep it
Girl, you on my mind all da time, dat's a secret, shhhh

Baby, I build you up
Girl, if I, have a show, I'd have you by my side
Girl, I build you up

Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine
Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine

Girl I think about you hopin' that you feel tha same way,
Or is it just ma imagination again runnin' away?
If you ready to ride, girl come on, let's roll
G5, how I fly, 'ma lets go
It was hard to measure da pleasure of havin' you in my presence
Yo smile makes me smile, I show you my style
We can shop a lil bit, I'll pick out sum shit
One pair at a time, till yo shoe game sick
Now who knows, what the future holds
We be together prolly, fo betta or for worse
Like Whitney and Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait... why pretend when you can move in
Befo I'll be yo buddy in bed, lemme be yo best friend
Girl it's mo' then lust, I want yo trust
You keep it reel wit me, I keep it reel wit'chu
'Cause I know wit'chu by my side, there's nothin' I can't do

Baby, I build you up
Girl, if I, have a show, I'd have you by my side
Girl, I build you up
Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine
When you up when you down
If you smile, if you frown
I'll b wit'chu baby
La La La...

Baby, I build you up
Girl, if I, have a show, I'd have you by my side
Girl, I build you up
Girl, I need to know fa sho, you mine
When you up when you down
If you smile, if you frown
I'll b wit'chu baby
La La La...
