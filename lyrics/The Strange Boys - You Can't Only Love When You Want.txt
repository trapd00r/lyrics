What a crazy game, I can't use your name 
In this atmosphere 
A class conscious click, everybody lives slick 
You ain't accepted here 

** But I'll be your Puppet on a string 
Just for a chance to be your everything 
This life ain't nothin' if I'm not with you 
And I give it all up, and this is what I'll do 

* I'll change my situation 
Leave materialization 
For you 
This is what I'm gonna do 
Change my circulation 
Leave extravagation 
For you 
Don't need, don't want, don't need nothin' nothin' more 

(Rap) 

I got no money, I got no yacht 
I can't compete with what your friends got 
But if it's love that your talkin' today 
Then take my hand and let's slip away 

This prejudice place, will never embrace 
Anything but their own 
They're stuck on the thought, that's everything's bought 
And you don't bring strange boys home 

But I'll be your Puppet on a string 
Just for a chance to be your everything 

My friends may not see what I see in you 
But I'll give'em all up, and this is what I'll do 

* Repeat 

(Rap) 

Too raw 
And too cold 
All your family and your friends 
Live in the "Days Of Old" 

** Repeat 

* Repeat
