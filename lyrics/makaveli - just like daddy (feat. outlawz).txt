I met her when she was younger
Her daddy died when she was younger
Her moms let her do what she please it seemed no one loved her
Her eyes shined love a diamond in the rough
The kind that you can love
Not yet touched
With so much, potential
Youngster, let me got your mental
Into a place, with the sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace you were born with that face
Nothing but pure beauty
So for an eternity I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah, oh yeah baby I got plans to mold ya
And in the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to
As we roll closer
I'll take your hand gladly
Anything ya need ask me
Spoil my baby girl just like daddy

You alleviate the stress spending time with you, I feel blessed
When you gone feel the pain so strong
Deep in my chest
When I got arrested
Came so close to going to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin they nails
Screamin loud goin' all out
Damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house
Watchin the kids, through the whole bid
In tha V-I
I seen ya daily
When my fake homies try ta fuck you
You run and tell me
That's why I stay committed
I thank God every time I hit it
Hoping you'll forgive me, for the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world
We untouchable
Screamin like ya dying every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity
And through the years
I know ya gave me your heart
Plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up
You still love me

Come to me anytime you want
Dedicate slow jams on the radio
Oh I
Know your happy I can feel ya passion
Looking out for ya just like daddy
Come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close your eyes, and feel the magic
Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

Come to me anytime you want
Dedicate slow james on the radio
Oh I
Know your happy I can feel ya passion
Looking out for ya just like daddy
Come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close your eyes, and feel the magic
Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

Boo would ya, die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
Fool when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county writing letters how I miss you
Giving you credit, apologetic how I dis you
Get you for thinkin' like a minor and on a level of one
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dine ya
Lace ya for total vigina and still
We right behind ya tru
Life just me and you no tellin' what we could do
Getting high between the sheets
Make the shit right here discrete
Putting hickies on ya belly while we fucking on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy

(Young Noble)

Shorty I lend my hand out to help ya
Lost soul looking for shelter
On the late night accept it
Treat ya good won't disrespect ya
My age is young
Out of place binge days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hon
Placed her under my wing
Showed her how we swing
Now she rollin' blunts for a king
One day labeled thug Mrs
The essence of my ghetto sistas
Hugs and kisses
That's just for me to be a father figure

Come to me anytime you want
Dedicate slow jams on the radio
Oh I
Know your happy I can feel ya passion
Looking out for ya just like daddy
Come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close your eyes, and feel the magic
Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
