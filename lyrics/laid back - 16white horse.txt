Do you remember the old ways of rocking it?
Laying the law down and microphone talking-it
Telling it. Spelling it out in block capitals
Cardboard boxing and rap battling...

Dang-diggy-dang...

Border towns burning. Churches with the roof off
Searching for purchases, we play fight and goof off
Streets ain't safe. Television talking trash
Travelling. Horseback. Collecting scars. Clocking cash
Pocket changes. Rocket ranges. Seeking the heat
Straight muscling. Hustling. Freaking the beat
Sharks circling. Working. Bees buzzing like cell phones
Hell no's and yes-y'allin'. Assholes and elbows
Customized hot rod. Fire you should face
Funny papers? Ha! Money can't buy you good taste
Heads popping off. You're an orgasm addict
Cock buzzing. Suppertime - you're having haddock
White rice and vegetables. Wild style illegible
People skills dubious. Memory incredible
Lemons and rusty cages. Dusty pages turning over
Calling shots. Color commentary. Earning clover
Ten fold. Leaving women wondering, men fooled
Struggling. Sick in the head like Glenn Gould...

Dang-diggy-dang...

Boycott! Don't believe the hype. Shoot the umpire
Up in the air, shots rang out like gunfire
Gainsbourg. You need Lou Reed and Beefheart
Push the button, burn the house down and re-start
Drum sends messages. Touched by a golden finger
Midas beside us. Head stuck up the colon-sphincter
6 million ways. Household made of glass
Edge. I'll look you dead in the face and say, "degoulasse"
Faceless. The odors are colorless and tasteless
Silly goose, too stupid to realize you're racist
Motorcycle chain and disdain for the money-clippers
Strippers taking time off, wearing fuzzy bunny slippers
Las Vegas war zone. Idiots and sundry dummies
Stumbling. The rumbling of hungry tummies
Zig-zagging. Criss-crossing. Hell's down and heaven's up
Animal noises. The sounds of engines revving up like...

Dang-diggy-dang...
