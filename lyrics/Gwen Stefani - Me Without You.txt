Take anything you want I'm ready
Take, you can take it I don't care, I don't care
Hey, there's more of me and you've seen nothing
Hey, you've done nothing that I can't repair, I can't repair

No I don't need you, not a little bit
To myself, I've finally admitted it
No I don't need you, not a little bit
Get rid of it, whoa

And now I'm me without you
(And things are 'bout to get real good)
Watch me breathe without you
(And things are 'bout to get real good)
Oh, you're fading so fast
I can hardly see ya when I look back, oh
Now I'm me without you
(And things are 'bout to get real good)
Hey, hey, watch this, things are 'bout to get real good
Hey, hey, watch this, things are 'bout to get real good

Whoa, I can stop pretending
And whoa, I can finally be myself, be myself
Yeah bring it on, bring it on, I got this
I forgot how good it felt, good it felt

No I don't need you, not a little bit
To myself, I've finally admitted it
No I don't need you, not a little bit
Get rid of it, whoa

And now I'm me without you
(And things are 'bout to get real good)
Watch me breathe without you
(And things are 'bout to get real good)
Oh, you're fading so fast
I can hardly see ya when I look back, oh
Now I'm me without you
(And things are 'bout to get real good)
Hey, hey, watch this, things are 'bout to get real good
Hey, hey, watch this, things are 'bout to get real good

Say whatever I want
Do whatever I want
Hey

Say whatever I want
Do whatever I want
Hey

Say whatever I want
Do whatever I want
Hey

Say whatever I want
Do whatever I want
Hey

Say whatever I want
Do whatever I want
Hey

And now I'm me without you
(And things are 'bout to get real good)
Watch me breathe without you
