Hey boy!
Where are you going with that little toy?
You know it's heavy...
When we look into that open void!
...but animals don't think of it at all.
HEY BOY!!! HEY BOY!!! (ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!)

We are one and we have found
They only wanted you around
To hold it down so hold your ground
We won't be here forever

We are one and we have found
They only wanted you around
To hold it down so hold your ground
We won't be here forever

Hang on! Till the winner comes!

Games over losers, I have all the money!

We are one and we have found
They only wanted you around
To hold it down so hold your ground
We won't be here forever

We are one and we have found
They only wanted you around
To hold it down so hold your ground
We won't be here forever

We are young and we have fun
And all we've found in being around
Is 'all in all' and 'Holy Cows'
While things keep getting heavy!

Hang on!
To your man and hang on!
To your woman and hang on!
