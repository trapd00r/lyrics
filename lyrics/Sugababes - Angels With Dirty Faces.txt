I'm confused, I don't know
Which way do I really go
This guy is fly
But another one pass me by
Stuck in the middle in this spot
That he's too damn hot
Shall I choose the one
With the heavy car or not
'Cause nothing ain't serious
See I'm only seventeen
And I wanna be mysterious
Naughty, sexy on the creep
Never sleep
Won't reveal the sneaky side of me

All day and night and I creep out
I think about who I'm gonna go and link up
Don't think that I'm innocent, baby
'Cause this is driving me crazy
Tell me what do you see
I'm not an innocent girl

You don't know where we go
And you don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the down low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

I' say that I'm the kinda of girl
You'd say is shy
But I don't think that's the answer
You'd hear if you asked my guy
I'm just a girl who likes to let it go
Party with my ladies till dawn
Still don't just let it go

Move your heads to the beat
And shake it down like you never did before
Move a little closer come with me
I'll show you the place to e
That's what he said to me

You don't know where we go
And you don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the down low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

You don't know where we go
And you don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the down low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

We're the type of girls don't think
Just say everything we want
We know we'll get our own way
Sexy, classy
Don't think you'll put it past me
Angels in the day
But at night could be nasty
Wanna have the fellas locked on ice
Wanna play around with them like dice
He didn't know I was a freak until he met me after dark
He tought this girl was chic

You don't know where we go
And you don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the down low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

You don't know where we go
And you don't know
That we're angels with dirty faces in the morning
You don't know we've been on the down low
You don't know that we're missing to the morning

You don't know where I go...
