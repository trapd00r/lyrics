In another place
In another time
In another face
In another line
In another heart
In another world
In another girl

We were feeling fine
We were in love
We were in love

In your father's tears
In all your mother's pain
In all the world's fear
We'd be the same

In another world
In another time
In another girl

We were feeling fine
We were in love
We were in love
