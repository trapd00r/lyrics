"...The smoke and the fire...
My time alive is almost over..."

Hey you! I’ll tare down that cross
No don’t try to stop me, oh no - Ore I’ll bury you in dust
One move! You be shure it will hurt
NoYou can not cure this disease - It’s the devils own work

I’ll tare down that cross
Time to pay – Knuckledust

Oh, Father, father – Forgive me I have sinned
I rely don’t know just where I shall begin
There’s been some incidents of cursing in your name
But I don’t give a fuck - I’m thrashin’ anyway

You speak of innocence – Salvation - Not to lust
I’ve had it up to here - I say it’s time to stop
I gonna brake your bones and crack you piece by piece
No you can’t stop me - It’s a devilish disease

A thousand red lights are burning in my eyes
I’ve broken bones to raise my fist up to the sky
The chains I pull are rusted, jeweled with hooks
It’s razor sharp – come closer take a look

Smell my knuckles - Stench of death
I gonna show you how I like my flesh
I gonna nail you to a hole in the ground
Gonna slice you up good - ‘Till you don’t make a sound

Father, father – Forgive me I have sinned
I rely don’t care about your holy whim
There’s been some incidents of killing in my name
I’m a bastard soul - I kill’em anyway

You speak of purity - Damnation and of sin
My ears are bleeding - Cuz Hell is where I’ve been
I gonna brake your neck and throw you to the wolves
You can’t stop me now - Hear the wicked howls

A thousand fires are flaring up the sky
The wish for death you fear - Come crawling deep inside
The chains I pull are rusted, jeweled with hooks
It’s razor sharp – come closer take a look

"I have willingly torn my soul
And sold it to the Devil
To the point of no return I go
Without purity and redemption"
