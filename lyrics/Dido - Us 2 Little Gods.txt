Walking home, burnt and red
Sticky thin, he said
Let us go, down in the woods
Can you be careful she said
Us 2 little gods with the world at our feet

Sticky thin, how you've grown they said
You'll never fit in your long white dress
When's he going to try and get a job
I'm just thankful for what we've got she said
Us 2 little gods with the world at our feet

Just this life I need no other
Just this day I need no more
Just this moment, let it all stop here
Let it all stop here, I've had my fill

Summer's here, early again
Let's take the kid and go and celebrate
Drinking beer, moon on the left
And there's the sun, hold my hand he said
Us 3 little gods, with the world at our feet

Just this day, I need no other
Just this life, I need no more
Just this moment, let it all stop here
Let it all stop here, I've had my fill

Just this life, I need no other
Just this night, I need no more
Just this moment, let it all stop here
Let it all stop here, I've had my fill

Just this life, I need no other
Just this day, I need no more
Just this moment, let it all stop here

I've had my fill
