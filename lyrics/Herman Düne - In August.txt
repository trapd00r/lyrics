You were talking to me and looking at a monkey
Feeding a monkey fruit and bread
You know what:
Everybody dies in august when no-one cries
Or in someone's cruel cruel eyes
But we're not dead
I'd found a bug in the water jug
It lay numb on my thumb
I blew it away and let it play
On the floor at my door
You were talking to me and looking at a monkey
Feeding a monkey fruit and bread
You know what:
Everybody dies in august when no-one cries
Or in someone's cruel cruel eyes
But we're not dead
