Iouldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
Shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down, my baby
Find out everybody knows that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We've got a little bit before we go and tear this love apart

There's no fight, you can't fight
This battle of love with me
You win again
So little time, we do nothing but complete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be following you

Oh girl

Oh baby, I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you

You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all

There's no fight, you can't fight
This battle of love with me
You win again
So little time, we do nothing but complete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be following you

You win again
So little time, we do nothing but complete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be following you

You win again...
