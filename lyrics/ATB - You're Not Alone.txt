You're not alone
Open your mind

In a way it's all
A matter of time
I will not worry for you
You'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you
And when you look behind
You will surely see
A face that you recognize

You're not alone
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone
I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind
Baby there's time for me and you

You're not alone
I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see

It is the distance
That makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close
Now so many miles apart
I will not falter though
I'll hold on 'til you're home
Safely back where you belong
See how our love has grown

You're not alone
I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone
I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind
Baby there's time for me and you

You're not alone
I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind
Surely it's plain to see

You're not alone
You're not alone
I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind
Surely there's time to be with me
