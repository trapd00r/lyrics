ROUND 1:

Real Deal:
Where the fuck is Micky Worthless?
All that shit he talked online you would've sworn the man was Cassius
Then he called Dirtbag two days ago like "Bruv, I called the airline to track my baggage
Apparently Expedia fucked up my travel passes."
Suck a dick you limey cunt
I hope your next flight across the Atlantic crashes
The real reason he didn't come he knew right off the bat this Yankee would turn Micky to Mantle ashes
So let's get it cracking
Now that the Mick is gone it looks Rocky
And I'm ready for that Clubber Lang fight
United Airlines; you see an Asian get drug in plain sight
Everybody Knows that when Asians write raps they probably do with symbols
Marvelous Marvin, Royce even said you're a Hagler
Cause you Jew'ed your way into tunes with nickel
I'm joking, you're official
And when it comes to rappers with the biggest tits... you are O'fficial
Hey Illmac, you realize that anybody that's ever met you at anytime in your life can say they knew you when you were little
Hey, it could be worse, imp juice
You could be Everybody Knows
You ever heard one of his records bud?
I'm gonna play that shit for my students to show them the effects of drugs
I don't know if it's the acid hits or the fuckin' crystal meth he does
But I heard your tape buns like Emilio Estevez in the Breakfast Club
Listening to an album from Everybody Knows with Hawaiian production
There's not an amount that you could pay me
I'd rather watch your family play Rock Band to see who has the hot hand with ukuleles
I'd rather watch Illmac rap about waving around an Excalibur
Or hear Stacks say "Faggot!" a thousand times in a round Frank, shameless like you playing the Gallagher
Battles like this, will make me want to go back to teaching and circle a date on my calendar
And Marv can get the iron to his head like he breaking in the McCallister's
You are an Asian lesbian from Hawaii
I'll bet every woman you ever fucked in your life has up and turned dyke
How can you be a Mark, and look like Zuckerberg's wife?
That's one

Illmaculate:
Ey it's rebuttal time
So what I just beat Chilla
Y'all just tryna beat each other
I ain't even stutter
I mean All Eyez On Me, the spirit of Afeni hovers
Cause I'm here fresh off a body like the tears of a grieving mother
I swear to God there's normally five targets
And I spit a round that no-one beats
This time, rappers counting on they sheep
It's five rappers, I leave rappers - I'm doubting that they'll sleep
And I'm leaving 5-0; woop woop that's the Sound Of Da Police
Tell Dan, our audio's the best
Avocado with the red; that mean my audio's the best
Set 'em up I knock them down like dominoes, except
Every round I'm going 5; that's the Domino Effect
Like Frank you shouldn't rap, you should be in the crowd
I give a fuck if you're flippedy-dippedy - Frank you got a shitty style
His whole thing is "rap is a joke" I had to take a minute out
Like "Rap is a joke"?
Heard him rapping, ha ha I get it now
Yo we ain't on the same plane I hijack the flight
Fans saying the can't take it, it's like bad advice
This an introduction to women's suffrage; strike after strike
Faster fists than Master Ip; leaving the ring with 5 bags of rice
This the Caddy Royale
I swear to God, I can feel the spirit of Cadalack in the place
But for some reason I feel like Frak in a way
Oh yeah, probably cause I took this battle today
Even though my opponents are a slap in the face
Time!

Everybody Knows:
Dan hit my jack
He said "Mickey can't make it there's no hope for him."
I said "What a waste of time, resources and perfectly good opium."
I said "What about the three people on the internet, from the U.K. that wanted to vote for him?"
I said "What about the eight bars that I wrote for him"
Last month we did a Watch Live, it was quite the visit
Till Greg put on me getting bodied by OnlyOne cause he's a spiteful midget
Little man, Scribble Jam, most disrespectful thing I can say about you is you look like a Timbers fan
So we can have a fight like I won't get back into bed
Frank used to rock with Peacoat now he's a gangster instead
But folks are fashioned again
Before Ex-I panicked and fled because his grandpa was dead
He was slapping the living shit out of back of your head
I said Frank is the best
I said every Echo shirt Real Deal buys becomes mandatory cop attire
I said every Echo, Phat Farm, Rocawear shirt Real Deal buys becomes mandatory cop attire
I said he makes his student watch The Wire
And prays that he does not get fired
His lack of skill creates a void that his accent fills
But whenever a snitch cracks he kicks back like "Fam, let's build."
Shoot me the beat
He can't help it, Trevor's looked like the police since his Scribble days
21 Jump Street meets 21 Savage; it's a rave!
He went in deep cover as an alcoholic rapper, now he's an alcoholic rapper
Boy it's a shame, you don't even got no fucking leads
You know what you fucking need boy it's a raise
I say Illmac, fuck your Timbers game
I said him and Frank play Good Cop Bad Cop, but which cops
I don't fuck with cops, lick shots in the name of... hip-hop
And no, I'm not forgetting I'm in the groove
I'll get to you Marv but right now I'm trying to ignore the elephant in the room

Marv Won:
I'm feeling like this battle was a setup
I'm the only fat guy
And no matter what Frank Stacks tells y'all, I am the only black guy
But if you come round here with that trash cooning
Then you leaving with two black eyes
So I got a real question for you Frank, who, in the fuck is that guy?
Fam, this is your formal invite to someone giving a fuck
You should of wore a black tie
But I bet you got a black belt
You probably wear it when you make pad thai
Look, you are a rapper from Hawaii
When's the last time y'all produced an actual mam
He's behind the times
His idea of spam mail is putting a stamp on an actual can
I am so mad at you Dan
I feel like you committing murder with the lies
You promised me Five Guys no homo
I was expecting a burger and some fries
You told Frank the exact same thing, so homo
All he heard was "the guys"
Now there's two different levels of disappointment but the same type of hurt in our eyes
I need a drink, somebody get me a beer
Question, what's 99% shifty and weird
The answer: booking Mickey that's why he isn't here
Look I am not Pesci, I am not Loe Pesci
So let me tell you what I was finna do
Give you two choices: Get the shit slapped out of you
Or some sense stumped into you
Look just come out and be a gay rapper like Eminem in The Interview
It's crazy, how you giving us a bad rap
But I'm the class act I'm Blade Brown and Pender Hughes
And then there's you
Always trying to sell me Ty Cobb like he is the shit
Of course you would love Ty Cobb y'all both racist pieces of shit
Fucking Real Deal Mauer
I know dude
His thinking is old school
Don't think cause you eat black prostitutes that you now ready for soul food
Hey Dig it, all these competitors is done
I'm way better with a gun
I'm a much better surf boarder than you
And I can dance better than your son

Frank Stacks:
Ey what's up San Jose?
Ey who else could take six years off
Come back just to flip queers off
Ride down to San Jose just to shave Dirtbag Dan's faggot ass beard off
I'm such a pure boss I never took a near loss or even let a tear drop
I leave you with hearing loss
So even if I steered wrong or veered off
I still get a clear shot
So when you see that van go (Van Gogh) your ears gone
But your ears ain't going nowhere!

[Real Deal] (laughs) I can hear it, I hear that

[Marv Won] Talk to that man (laughs)

[Frank Stacks] Let me tell you 'bout his ears though

Your ears need to be tucked
And your cheeks are flushed
Your eyes are too close together and your teeth are bucked
Your nose - bro all your facial features are fucked
Somehow you look like a weasel and a duck
I mean Jesus fucking Christ, think about your guys' battle rap career
And everything you've accomplished in your life
And now you're here
Battling me, what the fuck is wrong with you guys?
Fucking.. Jesus Christ
I mean, let me foreshadow
You see I only got like four battles
Y'all got like 100 more battles
And you're so black you've probably never met you dad bro
In fact, you're so black that before the battle your shadow thought that you're it's shadow
You're so fucking fat you got like four shadows!
Well here we have the penis shrinkage of Peter Dinklage
I was gonna say that when you fuck a bitch it's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway
But then Marv would be sitting there thinking about hot dogs all day
I just heard Marv say "Which hallway?"
Ey after the battle Marv gone be at the bar talking bout "What kind of hot dogs y'all make?
What's up Ohana
You're over here like Moana got butt fucked by an iguana
I mean I don't even know what the fuck race you are
This shit is way too hard
I tried to come up with some racist bars but the only thing I can think of is you race your car
So take that
Marv I will fucking break that off if you wave that arm
And all racism aside you look like you were raised on an actual egg plant farm
I mean how the fuck do you get in and out of your car
Without setting off the alarm
You're so fucking fat, blind people have told me "I can see him from afar."
And God never said "Let there be dark."
Oh well, here you are

ROUND 2:

Real Deal:
So your name's Stacks
But your resume doesn't outside the West Coast
But to be frank, you're a funny guy
So you made a good impression on the Cali end though
I said, you say shit that's real clever like "AIDS"
Your watch is probably set to Grind Time I hope you accepted times changed
They say only the good die young
You'll probably live to be Betty White's age
I'm saying look, you say "faggot" a thousand times in a round
That's not as innocent as it seems
He put on gloves for this battle
Cause he'll never leave his finger prints on the scene
Fuck it, I said your act is still as shit
It's one we all done seen before
Battle rap, you're a ghost, you can't see the indicator, I'll spell it out for you like a Ouija board
You say "rap sucks" then what the fuck you still press up CDs for?
Plus you look and dress like every white guy ever caught on surveillance robbing a convenience store
Ey, y'all guys ever heard a Frank Stacks song?
You ever heard one?
Man
He be like "It's ya boy Frank Stacks hella hot, swerving and serving perfect"
Who the fuck listens to that shit outside your clubhouse and circle jerks?
And Marv, you over the hill and yet, you still a vet
But are you still a threat you pillow pet?
Fuck strikes let's get it cracking
You couldn't put together a solid round on a Billiard set
Big man in Detroit
Big as far as Marv go big but no heart though
Darko Milicic
You? Short as a milosec
I'm back barring them
So tell Matt [?] Willow's next
I said, every time I hear you rap I hear of the blood sweat and tears you put in
Every time I buy new sneaks
This is a rap battle please stop trying to out haiku me
I got goons in the Zay and the outfit show guns (shoguns) like Ryu
And they'll bust in this bitch like it got a IUD

Illmaculate:
Listen buddy, that whole "cut my ear off" bit
That was cut-throat I mean it
It's perfect, cause I slash lobes and paint with Van Gogh's brushstrokes of genius
Real Deal should be in Juggalo make up
Opening for Tech N9ne
Marv Won, got left behind right around Em's prime
I'll pay Frank Stacks if he can tell us an event that he's headlined
And, Everybody Knows when I tea off I make him exit like Ex-I
Hold on, when I tea off I make him exit like Ex-I
You know, cause when you take the T off of "exit" it's Ex-I?!
I can see Frank at a bus stop
Time
Nah, look look
County skinny jeans
Cigarette in his ear
His whole style says he might discover the internet in the year
If rap was a joke, you would clearly be the king
But he thought since I can't be taking seriously
I'll just make not be taken seriously, a thing
You, are racist
I mean that isn't enough?
Fans don't fuck with you unless they're outliers
Hip-hop looks at you like nortenos to a south sider
Labels said he would be harder to put out, than a wild fire
No wonder we only see him at the Rumble, he's an outsider
Marv, you need to check ya hoe and keep her in line
He thinks she faithful cause he gave her home and ring and some wine
I gave her a blunt, told her to "roll up"
She gave me dome, my seat was reclined
Smoking weed in the ride
Link with your princess and, she blowing me on the side like the Ocarina Of Time
Hold on, Trevor changes how he talks depending on who he's talking to
Like if you're white, it's "Hey y'all hey"
If your French it's "En France"
If you're Mexican it's my compadre
If you're black he's talking out the side of his mouth like Conway
You are so boring
It takes white guilt to be your fan
Rest in peace Sandra, now you getting killed for being Bland
Bruh, you are a poser, and there's no worse reality
I mean he's the only person with multiple personalities and no personality
In this ring, no-one's shooting, Home Improvement
Tool Time
You lost to The Saurus, and that's the homie Two Times
I killed you at Ether, now I'm killing you two times
Plus I got six and a half racks for that
He didn't even get two
Time!

Everybody Knows:
There's a lot going down right now
Marv and Trevor are both looking at their phones
Shit ain't looking okay
I mean I pulled out my phone but Tinder automatically popped up so I put it away
Bunch of mushrooms, last night, some other shit, drank a lot, took it to the dome
Dude, you guys are fucking stupid I've done so much fucking shit in this past 48 hours and I ain't fucking looking at my phone
Yo Marv
Last time I saw you outside of Team Backpack you called me a "dirt bag", what's up ock?
People that live in gingerbread houses shouldn't throw gum drops
If I said Micky looked like a bum propped on the Market street bus stop
He would just laugh cause it's a way of life and ask me "Why the fuck not?"
But he's not here so I should just stop
And Frank, is what could stack to happen if Daniel Blackton's dad was rapping
Too $hort, what's my favorite word? Yo it's faggot you're the faggot captain
Grab the ratchet, peel all on you, that's a banana blanket
It's a re-branding tactic
This motherfucker's birth name is Francis Stackson
Wikipedia..
And it's always laid back and easy going with Trevor
Except for the moments I wonder how he holds it together
The first bear is chilled the next one he hope he remembers
He sounds like Howie Mandel and Bubba Sparxxx thrown in a blender
I look at Marv, I say "Don't die"
"I'll be so hurt."
His arteries look like a network of banana flavored Gogurts
Back of Marv's neck look like a old shirt
And Frank's rapping system is like Marv's metabolism; it don't work
I said, in Portland, these Aryians are getting me nervous
Illmac, fuck you and your vegetarian delivery service
Either grow it in a garden, put it in the cooler, bring it to work and shit it into a hole a hole in the ground
Or you are missing the purpose
I said it's a disturbance
You stupid little, fucking hippy perversion
Don't preach to me, talk to Marv when his kidneys are bursting
I won't sit through the sermon
I said, Micky is worthless as an appendix to surgeons
Before conditions have worsened
And the rest of the round was Micky Worthless fuck shit
So I had to cut it
Yo this is just some, freestyling bullshit that I just spit
Yo the gloves fit
Yo I said, I'm lyrically impressive
Frank's always wearing those gloves to keep his prints off all the children he's molested
Time

Marv Won:
I keep looking at my phone cause girls send me pictures of them naked
Tell your uncle "good job" it took him 15 minutes to make it
The phone! It's racist
Out of all your brothers and sisters, I can tell you your mother's pussy
Without question, the softest thing to come out mother's pussy
And I know, because I put a lot of things in your mother's pussy
Get a whiff of this beer, you smell that? That's your mother's pussy
And I would've been your dad cause your mom's a chubby chaser
She send me texts like "Wanna fuck me later?"
But I always turn her down cause the bitch built like a rugby player
Look she really let herself go
You look like the younger version of the older asian from Orange is the New Black
Dan, you was trying to start a dream team, this the worst five
I see loser, loser, lose- man there's more L's up here than my shirt size
Agent 47; Now I'm getting paid to merk guys
I'm running through the Zay testing out a new 40 like Reverse Live
You married?
I just want to ask your wife "why ma'am?"
Why do fools fall in love with you don't you know Frankie lie man (Frankie Lymon)
I say I got a handful of goonies that'll really handle an uzi
We two different types of animals; that's banjo-kazzooie
And let me find out that he say he played me
Bow! Y'all gone have to give EK an EKG
I said all it takes is one car to turn this into a dumb brawl
This pussy is a fish out of water; that's the Amazing World of Gumball
Nigga I'm pimping
I'm pimping
When I step the world play my theme song for me
I'm not leaving till I put five down in the ring, like King Kong Bundy
I say nigga the pen is wanted, for anyone who pretend to haunt it
Curve a bullet and kill everbody in the circle like the end of Warning
Killaz

Frank Stacks:
What the fuck y'all looking hard for
Y'all be like "Catch me looking hardcore at a golf course on a par four when I call four
Guys rolling on the floor like it's parkour
Pop shots, taking off bank accounts off shore, y'all poor"
Break em down...
"Sicker rounds, sophomore, I'm a boss and I floss more got your broad's jaw soar from a long broad sword taking off in a lier jet or the concord
Then shots poured, you don't want war
Then I run it back and do it again, just like an encore
Wait, hold up, run it back and do it again, just like an encore
Run it back and run it again -
No I said run it back and runs [?] in go check the box score
Your son, said he wants to live with his mom more
Oh it's me Real Deal, I make memes to explain my wordplay
Bro you clearly thought today was fucking "bring your kid to work" day
I mean y'all seen that movie Willow?
This Willow little brother
"Hillow"
I mean the motherfucker rello
His entire bed is a normal man's pillow
For a blanket he got to use an unrolled cigarillo
And one time his mom accidentally used him as a dildo
You need to chill bro
I give you that
One shot that's one kill
Two shots from that blue steel
Three shots that [?] rock and yeah she's a thot but she pay the bills
I keep it locked and I'm staying trill
That piece'll pop and you laying still
So we can box with blazing steel
You think you hot cause your name is Ill?
Everything is your favourite meal
And Everybody Knows you are gay for real
I mean what the fuck are you? "Hawaiinese"
Ok I feel like I need some sorta Chinese rhyme scheme like
If I was Chinese, I'd speak "Shanghainese"
Mandarin and [?] and drink chai tea
If I was Chinese, I'd be like 5 foot 3
Ride a Hyundai Saigon behind me
If I was Chinese, I'd probably wear a Saurus mask
And every left turn I'd have a car crash
If I was Chinese I'd cook my fly rice
If I was Chinese I'd look like my wife
Bro I don't give a fuck what this little lesbian say
To us you're gonna be Chinese for the rest of the day
And Marv, Marv is out of shape, yet shaped like outer space
And he has to use an asteroid belt to keep his pants around his waist
But if I squeeze his tits, it's a Milky Way
I mean there is no more clean water in Flint Michagan
Thanks to the reservoir Marv's been swimming in
Before the battle, Dan hit my line
He said "Marv was trying to do a drive by so we can murder a burger and a side fries"
But really he did just come to this battle so he can get In and Out of five guys
I mean he was going jacking her box
And then suck Micky's D
You only came to this Royale cause you thought you was going real ill on this big mac of cheese
I mean every time you got to white castle, you have to shit
But your so fucking big you can't even reach around to wipe your asshole
Fat ass bitch
Time

ROUND 3:

Real Deal:
You really fucking put on gloves for this battle
Like a pantomimer
And you can't diss Marv, cause your pancake hoodie was made by his Aunt Jemima
Keep it a buck
Every time I see you on RUIN YOUR DAY, it fucking ruins my day
Cause there's Avocado and some other rappers laughing
And you open your mouth and take the fucking humour away
You don't always have to be a pretentious arrogant pompous cocksucker
You be like "Nah [?] didn't get that fools reference I felt the line could've been-"
Shut the fuck up no-one cares what you gotta say
And you, always reminding people how you know Royce

[Marv Won] I do

[Real Deal] Like we supposed to dap you and big you up
Bitch Julliard couldn't teach me to act like I give a fuck
If it's war we ride
Shotty coming so they horrified
Life goes on till you face down Corki like
When I battle Michigan rappers they go on coroner rides
Shit, they couldn't bring back Sno with the fucking Lord of Light
My stock at this point is Everybody Knows endorphin high
I bet when you rent a ride and enterprise you sign the lease as George Dakei
You nice with the pen, but somehow you always show your corny side
Type to say some shit growing up like "Yeah, Ford ain't the size for the dog"
Yes it is, if you Yorkie size
Ey Marv, what's your 600 pound life like
Fuck your life
What was it like going to family gatherings as a kid
Like to your grandmother
Illmac, the joy when you'd arrive
She said "Come here, Greg"
Have you stand against the wall to measure how much you grown
Disappointment in her eyes
Please fuck off with that tough talk cause since Jump Off I just thought you was one soft midget then
Marv Won, he not only raps, he produces
Just not insulin
Ey
I'm joking, aside from his ability to lick Royce's sack
I can't front, big boy can rap
Even had Illmac in his doomsday bunker nodding his tin foil cap
You're right we battled at Ether I can't front he can bring it
But it's your fault, cause y'all showed this bitch love over the net like Martina Hingus
You can't diss Illmaculate he's a legend you can't even think it
I don't care what tear he in, (Tyrion) you're right he's still Peter Dinklage
Let's go

Illmaculate:
You got me with that last reference
I'm thinking he's an awful menace
But the main fact that stood out is, Real Deal watches tennis
[Air Filters go on in the venue]
Y'all probably feeling stupid now
Cause that rebuttal was so dope the venue was like "cool it down"
Marv Won, meet Trevor Weller
He teaches Physical Education
He might be able to help you out with this spherical situation
Here's how Frank preps for every battle in his life
First he outs on what he thinks is a black accent but he's white
He'll wear a shitty hoody
Gloves, sunglasses in the night
And refuses to leave the house, if his hat's angle isn't right
Faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot
Bruh

[Frank Stack]
Bars!

[Illmaculate]
He wears gloves while he sleeps
He wears gloves at the gym
He wears gloves while he showers
He wears gloves while he swims
I mean
We went to the batting cage
I was like here put on some batting gloves
He was like "nah Ill it's cool, I'll just wear my rapping gloves"
It's ironic, you wanna talk about my height now, it's wack
I've got five thou' in fact that says underneath them gloves are White Power tats
Nope? Take them off
Take em off then!

[Frank Stacks]
I just got them removed, it's scarred up now alright?

[Illmaculate]
See I'm starting to think that those gloves are a tatoo
Same goes with the shades and the hat too
I mean
Real Deal, he got Fresco ghostwriting all his shit
I'm ghost riding
Hopping out the whip with his chick, face longer than a Johnny Bravo skit
Tell this Pittsburgh stealer, I'm a Polamalu wig
Your bitch ride me like a bronco; that's a Colorado trip
Big lighter, the stick fire like a Palo Santo lick
I'll magic mark a Marvin on hollow tip
Ice pick turn Frank's brain to guacamole dip
And take you out with a knife like an avocado pick
I'm known coast to coast
Whatever floats your boat
I asked him what his name was was, he said "Everybody Knows"
I said "no, they don't"
The chrome'll blow steam, put your face in your chest; motorboat theme
Real Deal in the water with sharks, trying to coach the home team
I'll smoke this Italian for cheese; that's a provolone scheme
If I put the iron to Marv's face it ain't a Home Alone scene
I know, I did it better
I battled last week
But I ain't more less stressed
I mean stay ready, don't get ready, my war chest prepped
I've always been above y'all, I'm a North West vet
I leave the entire place, Tyra Banks that mean I'm leaving four heads stretched!
Time

Everybody Knows:
Yo I said Trevor's had the same box of CDs for five years and still the packaging's tight
That last round was the most fans Illmac's ever had in his life
Marv, this is the part where I beat you like the passion of christ and...
Wait, Frank has a wife?
Yo I said I snort coke, I pop pills, I get my pre-flight on
And I put a green light on this little knee height John
His head so big, it looks like a Nintendo Wii icon
When Greg watches Scribble 04
He became a wee icon
I take mushrooms
I view the world from an exceptional view
You take mushrooms, Dirtbag Dan ends up wrestling you
Is that a wrestling move, or is that sexual abuse
I can't tell, so I'll just say that it's the best of the two
What's that?
A couple, half Mexican ass wrestling dudes
That type of battle rap shit like that'll put an impression on you
But I digress to the shrooms
Digesting a few
Keeps me grounded, and focused on my work
Illmac, you stupid hippie
Choking on the Dirt, ain't the same as getting closer to the earth
And Marv looks happy, but trust me, visiting his hard
Cause this time it's three devils with suspect similes and bars
So I got to do it differently with Marv
Just kidding you're so big and black you look like the shit between the stars
That's space
And Marv is the inventor, of the Uber XL flip
But you in the wrong seat could make an Uber XL fit
How's rap something you're going to excel with
When you probably die before you make an X outfit
And I said Frank, if rap is a joke
That's your thing, you have stake in it
But if rap is a joke then you're a joke when you partake in it
So logically that means - you know what this ain't some sick amazing flip
I was just going to use this as an excuse to hit a shoe with this potato chip
But Marv ate the shit
Trevor don't laugh, I heard - dude I said you let prostitutes rob you
I don't fuck with you
Cause I got a lebenese coke worker that knows bitches that will
Fuck for food
I ain't saying you're a simp
But simply put you're making me sick
The Real Deal is the way that a chick could take off with the cash without taking a dick
If that bitch was one of your students, she'd be undefeated at dodgeball
I hope that bitch gets a kick out of this footage like a Solange brawl
I said Marv you don't even have a third round
Frank you're a fucking odd ball
And Micky ain't here to trade a King of the Ronald's title match for this soft ball
Time

Marv Won:
I say yo
I had such a hard time writing this round
I was not motivated
But then Dan put up the other niggas in the battle
I was like "oh, I'm so the favourite"
That's because I teach the game the way you supposed to play it
Hell I even show love to Frank event though I know he hated
I hear the hatred in your voice, like "shit you know, Marv's so sloppy"
Now I'm riding with a big handle for that whining like Carlo Rossi
My heart is the colour of charcoal chachi
Nigga I hit yo attic and spark yo lobby
And I walk in the buffet and get a Don Demarko probably
You keep screaming out rap is a joke
No it's not
You are
So now I'm fucking up bitch ass rappers, that's fubar
You wear shades to block my shine
You hate to acknowledge a true star
And your little beef is gone get put in a box, [?] where the fuck is Kumar
You think Real Deal's gone save you?
You think he your brother's keeper
This nigga scared to death he barely survived his last run in with a Reepah
Nigga don't snort nor step
I'll extort yo set
Funny how I'm in my third round and I ain't crack a short joke yet
I'm just fucking with you lil homie
[Marv fakes a dap with Illmac]
Did that one go over your head
I'm saving these rounds till we get booked that way I know you dead
I say nigga I ain't black I'm OJ
Fuck it, I jigga the plot
Y'all want my opinion; nigga this ain't Pulp Fiction, this time Marv giving the shots
Y'all invited Kamala to the Rumble
The fuck, is you crazy dude
Yeah I'm a Detroit nigga
And I just brought them 380s through
And the last thing you gone see is that D over that navy blue
Like nigga, look what you made me do

Frank Stacks:
I mean look how many fucking stereotypes there are
I feel like I'm in the bar that's the bar where the guys walk into the bar bar
So is it going to be bars over jokes or jokes over bars
Wait here's a joke; 4 battle rappers walked into the bar at 2 in the morning
What bar? A gay bar, jokes on you, that's a fucking true story
I mean Marv you look like Allahu Akbar, and a ball of black tar
Yeah, I mean you're black but you're fat
You ain't that tall so you never really played basketball do you
Motherfucker you so fat and black if you laid flat on your back people will fall through you
You know I was gonna come with some fat black jokes
But a big black guy, you be like "Oooh! That was close!"
I will reach into your soul
Nah that's gross
I mean Micky didn't show up
Cause he really be off on them Molly pills
Next time I see his bitch ass he gone get molly walked and I swear to God
Before the battle I hear Illmac walking in the building talking about "We represent, the lollipop guild"
I mean lllmac you look like [speaks jibberish]
Bro you look like a miniature wigger starter pack
Mixed with one of Carter's cats
Trevor's favourite subject to teach [sound effects] Marshall Math
He placed wagers on which round Marv would have a heart attack
I lost
And everyone knows how many cars you crashed
I mean if Everybody Knows then why has nobody told you
The only thing everybody knows is nobody knows you
I mean your fingers are chopsticks
Your dick is a pot sticker
You simmer in dog dinner
[?] [?] [?]
You sit in your mom's kitchen like "[imitating the mandarin language]"
Hold on, sometimes I fucking spaz out
Start spitting shit off the top it's like my mind run from me
I swear to god my gun said "Chit chit daw daw!"
Doug funnie
Because my brain is like Canibus' notebook bitch I got pages
There's bars on top of bars on top of bars; Las Vegas
Taking shots in the car
Hotbox with chop' blazing
Thug Life tattoed on the stomach like Pac raised him
So save your gat bars so we can teach the Second Ammendment
Bitch I pass bars like I had protected defendant
Y'all think y'all was gone come to this battle and get paid off it
Fuck you faggots, this is Frank's profit
Good thing you're Real Deal cause you are a fucking fake Caustic
Never ever ever has there been a rapper that's more square
You be with 4th graders on the playground playing four square
You try to force your airs so they grow up to be sports players
Motherfucker I'm a dwarf slayer
So I ain't referencing books when I'm grabbing my techs
But y'all better duck down and stand on my left
Because when I start popping shots at these standard guys' chests
They gone be left with less options than a standardised test
Hey yo Caddy, who bout to win this little Rumble in the club
Is it A, B, C, D or E
Oh he said F you fucking faggots
None of the above
Time!
