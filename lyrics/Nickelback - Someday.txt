How the hell'd we wind up like this,
And why weren't we able,
To see the signs that we missed?
And try to turn the tables 

I wish you'd unclench your fists 
And unpack your suitcase 
Lately there's been too much of this 
But don't think it's too late 

Nothing's wrong 
Just as long as you know that someday I will 
Someday, somehow 

I'm gonna make it alright 
But not right now 
I know you're wondering when 
You're the only one who knows that 
Someday, somehow 

I'm gonna make it alright 
But not right now 
I know you're wondering when

That we could end up saying 
Things we've always needed to say 
So we could end up staying 

Now the story's played out like this 
Just like a paperback novel 
Let's rewrite an ending that fits 
Instead of a Hollywood horror 

Nothing's wrong 
Just as long as you know that someday I will

I'm gonna make it alright 
But not right now

You're the only one who knows that 
Someday somehow

You're the only one who knows that
