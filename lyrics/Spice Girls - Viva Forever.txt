Emma:
Do you still remember how we used to be?
Feeling together, believing whatever my love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun

All:
Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Melanie B:
Yes, I still remember every whispered word
Melanie B and Emma:
The touch of your skin, giving life from within like a love song never heard
Melanie C:
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
Melanie C and Emma:
Promises made, every memory saved as reflections in my mind

All:
Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Victoria:
Back where I belong now
Was it just a dream?
Victoria and Emma:
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me

All:
Hasta mañana
Always be mine
