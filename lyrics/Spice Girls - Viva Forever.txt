Do you still remember how we used to be?
Feeling together, believing whatever my love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun

Hasta mañana
Always be mine 

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes I still remember every whispered word
The touch of your skin, giving life from within like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved as reflections in my mind

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now, was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold, and the secret's safe with me

Hasta mañana 
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting (Viva forever... I'll be waiting),
Everlasting like the sun (Everlasting... Like the sun)
Live forever, for the moment (Live forever... for the moment)
Ever searching for the one (Ever searching... for the one)

Viva forever, I'll be waiting (Viva forever),
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment (Live forever)
Ever searching for the one

Viva forever, I'll be waiting (Viva forever),
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment (Live forever)
Ever searching for the one (For the one)

Viva forever, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting),
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment (Live forever)
Ever searching for the one (For the one)
