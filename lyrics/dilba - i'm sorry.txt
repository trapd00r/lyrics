i painted a picture of you
your soul was red, and your mind was blue
destiny laid a light on my creation

this dream i had made
a slave of my passion
reality was always too far away
and we were happy
until it came too close one day

and sudden i faced
the truth of my dream
my love had only been a picture, a scene
i suppose i needed too believe
didn't want too see
you had never been close to me

im sorry, this illusion
has caused you a lot of pain
and i have no solution
i'll try to never be back again
i'm sorry

i painted a picture of youmy dream was a lie
and the lie became truth
reality held it's breath too long
it's disgusting what dreams can do to you

but i'm sorry, this illusion
has caused you a lot of pain
and i have no solution
i'll try to never be back again

im sorry, this illusion
has caused you a lot of pain
and i have no solution
i'll try to never be back again
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
i'm sorry 
i'm sorry
I am....
