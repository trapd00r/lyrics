Let's get the sun in our day
Let's turn a spark to a flame
Let's get this thing on the move
My heart is longing to prove

That maybe without you
The world will grow colder
Come on let's do it
Before we're much older

Let's get to it right now
Make it happen somehow
Need your touch oh so much
Don't you see what I'm trying to say
Let's get to it right away

Let's get the show on the road
Our love would be solid gold
Let's put the key to the door
Don't put it off anymore

Till now it's only been dreams
I have lived for
Come on, let's do it
'Cause I wanna give more

Let's get to it right now
Make it happen somehow
Need your touch oh so much
Don't you see what I'm trying to say
Let's get to it right away

Till now it's only been dreams
I have lived for
Come on, let's do it
'Cause I wanna give more

Let's get to it right now
Make it happen somehow
Need your touch oh so much
Don't you see what I'm trying to say
Let's get to it right away

Let's get to it right now
Make it happen somehow
Need your touch oh so much
Don't you see what I'm trying to say
Let's get to it right away
