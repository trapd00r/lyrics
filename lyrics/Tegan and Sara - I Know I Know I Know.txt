From hundreds of miles yeah you cry like a baby
You plead with me shout scream
Tell me I'm staying
I know, I know, I know
I'm still your love

Back from the last place that I wanted to fake
You laugh with me shout scream
Now tell me you're staying
I know, I know, I know
You're still my love

The same as I love you
You'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless
It's me and you

Box after box and you're still by my side
The weather is changing
And breaking my stride
I know, I know, I know
It's just this day

House after house just like car after car
You see club after club
And it all seems so far
I know, I know, I know
What else are we here for?

The same as I love you
You'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless
It's me and you

Stick your hands inside of my pockets
Keep them warm while I'm still here
Tell them this love hasn't changed me
Hasn't changed me at all

Last night I was writing about you
I know my screaming and shouting won't keep you
I know, I know, I know
You're still my love

I wake up to the sound of you working
You're one room right over
You're stressing and loving me
I know, I know, I know
Be still my love

The same as I love you
You'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless
It's me and you

Stick your hands inside of my pockets
Keep them warm while I'm still here
Tell them this love hasn't changed me
Hasn't changed me at all

Stick your heart inside of my chest
Keep it warm here while we rest
Tell them this love hasn't changed me
Hasn't changed me at all

The same as I love you
You'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless
It's me and you

The same as I love you
You'll always love me too
This love isn't good unless
It's me and you
