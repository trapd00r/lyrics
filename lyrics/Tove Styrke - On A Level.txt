You're talking so tall, yo
Like you won the lotto
But underneath it, I know what you're like
You say you're the baddest
But you ain't being honest
You ain't being honest, you lie

(You)
You've been talking through the roof
(You)
When I just want you to

Keep it on a level
Keep it on a level
'Cause you know you ain't gotta try
Nah, nah, nah, you ain't gotta try
Keep it on a level
Keep it on a level
'Cause you know you ain't gotta try
Nah, nah, nah, you ain't gotta try

Don't know what to say, yo
It ain't like me to tiptoe
And keep it on the down low, can't lie
I know you got issues
But right now you just ain't you
And I just kinda miss you, alright

(You)
You've been talking through the roof
(You)
When I just want you to

Keep it on a level
Keep it on a level
'Cause you know you ain't gotta try
Nah, nah, nah, you ain't gotta try
Keep it on a level
Keep it on a level
'Cause you know you ain't gotta try
Nah, nah, nah, you ain't gotta try
(Keep it on a)

You're trying to please me
But just take it easy
No, I don't want you to change
Just speak body language if you wanna have it
It's all that I want you to say

(You)
You've been talking through the roof
(You)
When I just want you to

Keep it on a level
Keep it on a level
'Cause you know you ain't gotta try
Nah, nah, nah, you ain't gotta try
Keep it on a level
Keep it on a level
'Cause you know you ain't gotta try
Nah, nah, nah, you ain't gotta try
(Keep it on a)

Keep it on a
