Mmmmmm, ohoh, Hey!

(Game)
Picture me and my gangsta girl, riding with the top back.
Bangin' Ne-Yo, my neck freeyo, my sox hat,
Tilted to the side like you know I get my grind on.
Get my shine on.
Jewelry Black in all rhinestones.
Rims spinning like a globe, on these low pros.
Do it big 'cause I'm supposed to floss,
And that's the reason she break me off.
'Cause I'm gangsta,
And I'm ridin' wit...

(Ne-Yo)
Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman.
Rollin' like a boss through,
No matter the cost too,
Not tryin' to brag but money's not an issue.
Don't let your girl see us.
That might make her diss you.
'Cause if she roll wit us,
She wont even miss you.

(Game)
Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack,
Before it hit the ground she throw it back.
When I make it rain that's chump change,
That pay for the 26 on my range range range drive drive,
Take the wheel while I roll and slide,
Climb over to the passenger side and freeze.

(Ne-Yo)
And once again its on,
You should take a picture with your camera phone.
Playa she not comin' home,
And if I'm on her screen saver, that, that mean later we gone.
If I let her take a picture,
She gonna roll wit me.
If I let her take a picture,
She gonna roll wit me.
If I let her take a picture
She gonna roll wit me,
Gonna roll wit me,
Gonna roll wit me.

(Game)
If you don't know by now baby I'm a star,
Look at my face,
Look at my car,
Look at my waist then look at my scars.
Look out da window see where we are.
In my phantom, in my rover, bangin'...

(Ne-Yo)
Ne-Yo, it's a thug and a gentleman.
She ain't never rolled in a car wit da suicide,
Girl when it's you and I, they committin suicide.
All of them want, my girl.
'Cause she pretty and thick in the thighs.
Homie don't mastermind,
Do a song wit suicide.

(Game)
She call me Jay, I call her B,
We gettin' married, to the streets.
I'm chasin money, she chasin me.
I'm right where I wanna be,
With da B on my bentley,
Da horse on my lambo,
Crown on my cadalac,
Checks on my air max.
Haters, better fall back,
Before I put somin in your ball cap.
That's my chick, I got her back like a bra strap.
'Cause she fine and she cute,
She think she all that, and she all that.
That's my girl that's my world,

(Ne-Yo)
And once again its on,

Grab da wheel take control,
And let your hair blow inside my lambo.
Pull out ya phone, picture that.

She a 34 D, I'm so pleased.
I'm so so def, she so janet,
I'm JD and she full of me.
In da H2 we fold deep through the NYC off no sleep.
I hate to drive but I break it wide,
When I'm ridin' wit my shawty.
I'd kidnap her and neva take her home,
Ridin' off bangin' ne-yo sittin' on chrome,
In that mazaradi, see the paparazi,
They (flick flick flick)..she gone.
