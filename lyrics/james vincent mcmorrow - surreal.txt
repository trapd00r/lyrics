Tell me come over
Then settle in to read
And say it can wait
But I'm so unstable
That I begin to leave
Still holding this cage
I have dragged in corpses
Warmth on their lips
As evidence of life
I have found their voices
Hard to resist
Even when they lie

They're still talking
Telling me I run
Like I don't
Read the signs
Some are beating drums
Staying low but
Holding time

Show me something
Surreal
Your new lover
On fire
In the night
In the night
Are you hopeless
Like me
Then you'll notice
Those fires
In the night
In the night

Why can we never
Say the things we mean
Before it's too late
I've got some secrets
I intend to keep
Down to my grave
'Cause I have built a fortress
Failures and bricks
Underneath the ice
You have come
And placed your palm on my wrist
Dragged me in the light

Now I'm hoping
I will be enough
To behold
For a time
I would even trust
With control
Who relies

Show me something
Surreal
Your new lover
On fire
In the night
In the night
Are you hopeless
Like me
Then you'll notice
Those fires
In the night
In the night

In the night

Beg for it
Beg for it here
I'm nervous
That I'm insincere

Beg for it
Beg for it here

Show me something
Surreal
Your new lover
On fire
In the night
In the night
Are you hopeless
Like me
Then you'll notice
Those fires
In the night
In the night

In the night
