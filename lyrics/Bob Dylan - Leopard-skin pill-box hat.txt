Well, I see you got your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat
Yes, I see you got your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under somethin' like that
Under your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, you look so pretty in it, honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine
Your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, if you wanna see the sun rise, honey, I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sittin' there
In your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you, it's bad for your health, he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead
You know, I don't mind him cheatin' on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you makin' love with him, you forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for
It's your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat
