Weve gone too far now

oo far my eyes just cant see

ow we passably make love now

nd despite the circumstances

 love you dear

ou hurt me and make me cry

ou leave me one million times

ut when you need me, you know I will be down

nd you haunt me when youre not around 


hat kind of love is this,

hen we both hide behind our fences

ou want to be with me,

ut you wont take your chances

hat kind of love is this, is it enemy or shelter

ejecting or tracing me, when you say,

hings will get better.

t better 


f Im your star dear,

hen my force should be in your plans

ecause your my universe dear,

o my heart belong in your hands

o on and hurt me and make me cry

eave me, one million times

ou know you need me and

ou know youre mine so why dont you just

ove and let the sun smile
