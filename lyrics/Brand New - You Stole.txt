Last night they said the fire had spread and we said our prayers
And now the flames are burning me in my bed but I just don't care
We all go to sleep in the same place and in the morning hope that we're all the same
We'll just sit around like broke down cars in the lot waiting for repairs

There you go
There it goes

Well I wish that I was as good as you at caring and trusting
And I wish that my condition was new but I'm old and rusted
So we just hurry up only to wait
And add to the list of all the places we hate
And I'll pretend like I've got something to say but I've got nothing

And now I know what you stole
Yeah you stole
From the cradles they were rocked in
You took the first words that they spoke
Yeah you stole
Yeah you stole
So if I'm a liar then you're a thief
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight.

Stole
Yeah you stole
From the cradles they were rocked in
You took the first words that they spoke
Yeah you stole
Yeah you stole
So if I'm a liar then you're a thief
