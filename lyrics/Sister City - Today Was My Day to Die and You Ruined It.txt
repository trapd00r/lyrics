Faux fittingly I am forging ahead
Never better than
The last half-hearted heroic attempt
To stop the spread
The stench of sentience or any semblance
Every sentence as penance

I treat each symbol like a symptom
Of an overbearing trust
Buzzed because I always listen
And I care far too much

In the fight between substance and superficiality
I will ignore the referee
I will invite my enemies
To take shots at me
To lend credibility
To my oh-so-wounded delivery

I made a mess out of my memory
But found a future of my own
With each obscene release, I rinse, repeat
And ramble till I'm home

'Cause I'm as deftly deaf as ever
And stuck in skin I've seen grow old
So if today's the day, fuck bold and brave
The fight's left from my throat

I hit a wall
I had to crawl back
And reassess each penny spent
In spite of former confidence
But when I taught myself to walk again
I respectfully declined the chance
And planted myself stubbornly instead

And I stared at the ground
And I found myself imagining
That it meant something profound
So I made meaning out of everything I found

And silently
I will inspire amnesty
I will accept morality
And then engender empathy and consistency
To lend clarity
To my oh-so-important biology
