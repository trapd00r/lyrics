I can see all the way
To Mercury from Mission Bay
I can feel your frequency
Just one more thing
Cross yourself, cross yourself
Come to me

And no matter how hard you try
You can no longer be
Standing there where so many die
Anticipating

Over the new clear watercolor
Over the rocks and glass
And everything that's meant to be
Come to me
Cross yourself
Come to me

And you say all your life
You've been waiting for this time
Open wide spread your wings
Just one more thing
Cross yourself cross yourself
Come to me

Don't listen to what they say
There's no day like today
Ain't no secret cloud in the way
It will be so easy
