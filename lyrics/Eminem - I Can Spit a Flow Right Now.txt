[50 Cent talking]
 Ay Em you know my favorite white boy right...
 I.. I owe you for this one
 
 [Chorus]
 I've been patiently waiting 
 For a track to explode on (yea)
 You get stunned if you want
 And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
 A fuse like my flows 
 Been hot for so long (yea) 
 If you thinkin I'ma fuckin 
 Fall off your so wrong 
 
 [50 Cent]
 I've finished it in my head
 Like a baby born dead
 Destination heaven
 Sittin politic with passin just from 9-11 (yea)
 The Lords blessing left me lyrically incline (uh huh)
 Shit I aint even got to try to shine
 God's a seamstress who tailorfitted my pain 
 I got scribtures in my brain 
 I can spit at your thang 
 Straight out the good book 
 Look niggaz is shook 
 50 fear no man warrior 
 Swing swords like Conan 
 Picture me pen in hand 
 Write lines knowin' THE SOURCE will quote it
 When I die they'll read this
 And say a genius wrote it
 I grew up witout my Pops
 Shit that make me bitter 
 I caught cases and got out
 Does that make me a quitter
 In this white mans world
 I'm simmilar to a squirral
 Lookin for a slut
 Wit a nice butt to get a nut
 If I get shot today my phone
 Will stop ringing again
 These industry niggaz ain't friends
 They know how to pretend
 
 [Chorus (2x)]
 I've been patiently waiting 
 For a track to explode on (yea)
 You get stunned if you want 
 And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
 A fuse like my flows 
 Been hot for so long (yea)
 If you thinkin Im'a fuckin 
 Fall off your so wrong 
 (It's 50!!)
 
 [Eminem]
 
 Youve been patiently waiting
 To make it through all the hate
 Debatin weither or not
 You can even weather the storm
 When she lay on the table
 They operating to save you
 It's like a Angel came to you 
 Sent from the heavens above
 They think they crazy 
 But they ain't crazy lets face it
 Shit basically they just playin sick
 They ain't shit they ain't sayin shit
 Spray umh 50 [gun shots]
 A to K get in the way 
 I bring Dre and them wit me 
 And turn this day into fuckin mayhem
 You stayin wit me
 Don't let me lose you 
 I'm not tryin to confuse you
 When I let lose wit this oozee
 And just shoot through your Izuzu
 You get the message
 Am I gettin through to you 
 You know it's comin
 You motherfuckers dont even kno do you
 Take some BIG and some PAC 
 And you mix them up in a pot
 Sprinkle a little Big L on top
 What the fuck do you got?
 You got the realest and illest killers
 Tied up in a knot
 The Juggernaughts of this rap shit
 Like it or not it's like a fight to the top
 Just to see who die for the spot
 You put your life in this
 Nothin like survivng a shot
 Y'all know what time it is 
 Soon as 50 signs on this dot
 Shit what you know about death threats
 Cause I get alot
 Shady Records was 80 seconds
 Away from the towers
 Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
 They meant to hit ours
 Better evacuate all children
 Nuclear showers theres nothin spookier
 Your now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50!
 
 [Chorus]
 I've been patiently waiting 
 For a track to explode on (yea) 
 You get stunned if you want 
 And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
 A fuse like my flows 
 Been hot for so long (yea)
 If you thinkin I'ma fuckin 
 Fall off your so wrong 
 (It's 50!!)
 It's the Gun Squad here 
 And you hear the shots go off
 (It's 50, They say It's 50)
 You see a nigga laid out 
 Wit his fuckin top blown off
 (It's 50, Man that was'nt 50)
 They don't holla my name
 
 [50 Cent]
 You should'nt throw stones
 If you live in a glass house
 And if you got a glass jaw
 You should watch your mouf
 Cause I'll break your face
 Have you ass runnin 
 Mumbling to the check
 Your going against me dogg
 You makin a mistake
 I split yo lip 
 You lookin like them 
 Michael Jack-Son Jackets 
 Wit all them zippers
 I'm the boss on this boat 
 You can call me Skipper
 The way I turn the money over 
 You should call me Flipper
 Your Bitch a regular Bitch 
 Your callin her Wifey
 I fucked her feed her fast food
 You keepin' her Icey
 I'm down to sell records
 But not my soul
 Snoop said this in '94
 "We don't love them ho's"
 I got pennies for my dogs 
 Now I'm rich
 See the 20's spinnin'
 Lookin mean on the 6
 Nigga's wearin flags
 Cause the colors match they clothes
 The get caught in the wrong hood
 And filled up with holes
 Motherfucka'
 
 [Chorus (2x)]
 I've been patiently waiting 
 For a track to explode on (yea) 
 You get stunned if you want 
 And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
 A fuse like my flows 
 Been hot for so long (yea)
 If you thinkin Im'a fuckin 
 Fall off your so wrong 
 (It's 50!!)
