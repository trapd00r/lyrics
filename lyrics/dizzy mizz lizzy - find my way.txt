I'm
watching myself cry
Well I
Just I'm on that side
And I
Take it by suprise
And I apoligice
Cuz I will always find my way

I
Think I found the way
So stay
You can make my day
And I'll
I'll stop claimiess
And I apoligice
I realy need to find my way

You can see
what that will be
Time on a questions
Love in a mencius
as it was

You can see
what that will be
Find is a testius
Last thing impresion
as it was
But untill they find you there
I will swear to take care
And I'm fighting you all for you

Im
Trying to complie
But I'm
Just a passified
Ohh I
Sometimes I'm allright
Whith sealove through my eyes
Cause I will always find my way

You can see 
what that will be
time on a distance
love in a mention 
as it was

You can see 
what that will be
Find is a testions
Last thing impresions as I was
But untill they find you there
