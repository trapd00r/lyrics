No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do
No One Knows How To Love Me Quite Like You Do

Liyah you're the only one for me,
Liyah you're the only one for me,
Liyah you're the only one for me,
The one for me, the one for me

No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...

When it comes down to the things I like
Boy, you know just how to satisfy me
You pick me up when I'm down, you put my feet on solid ground
And you make me your first priority

(Keep it comin') keep it comin', babe
('Cause I like it) 'cause I like it, babe
Don't stop cause no one knows...

No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...

When there are clouds on a rainy day
You know how to bring sunshine to my life
And I've never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm your goddess

No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...

Well it's the L-I-Y-A-H plus the second chapter
R Kelly's spitin' tracks, as if it were tobacco
It's the 1990s, time to get the pockets phat
So when I say "book", you say "read that"
Now back to the matter of the song
No one knows how to love me like you do
I got words for you...
Uh! Forever my man!

No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...
No one knows how to love me quite like you do...

Liyah you're the only one for me,
Liyah you're the only one for me,
Liyah you're the only one for me,
The one for me, the one for me
