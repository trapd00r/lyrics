Too many fingers, too many thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
The best time I ever had
Waiting around for something bad

Fearless, fearless, oh
And I know that's why you love me
Fearless, fearless, come on
And I know that's why you love me, chico
And I know that's why you love me, chico
And I know that's why you love me, chico
Oh

So fearless
So fearless

This is what it's all about
Take me in and eat me out
Pins and needles in my arms
Lucky eyes and lucky charms

Fearless, fearless, oh
And I know that's why you love me
Fearless, fearless, come on
And I know that's why you love me
Fearless, fearless, oh
And I know that's why you love me, chico
And I know that's why you love me, chico
And I know that's why you love me, chico
Oh

So fearless
So fearless
So fearless
So fearless
Alright
