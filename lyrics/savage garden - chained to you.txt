We were standing all alone
You were leaning in to speak to me
Acting like a mover shaker dancing to Madonna then you kissed me
And I think about it all the time
Sweet temptation rush all over me
And I think about it all the time
Passion desire so intense I can't take anymore, because

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've got to be chained to you

And when you looked into my eyes felt a sudden sense of urgency
Fascination cast a spell and you became more than just a mystery
And I think about you all the time
Is this fate is it my destiny
Yeah I think about you all the time
I no longer pretend to have my hands on the wheel because

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've got to be chained to you

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've got to be chained to you

And I think about it all the time
And I think about it all the time
Tell me it's madness I barely know you

We were standing all alone you were leaning in to speak to me
Ten steps back you're still a mystery
Acting like a mover shaker dancing to Madonna then you kissed me
I can't take anymore cause

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've got to be chained to you

I feel the magic building around you
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've got to be chained to you

Tell me it's madness
I barely know you
