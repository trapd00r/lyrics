Answers are so hard to find
If you're selling dreams
Caroline
Wealth has only made you blind
The path back to beach
Is nowhere to be found
Caught between the ocean and the shoreline

Caroline, Caroline
Caroline, Caroline
Caroline, come back around
Come back around

She sleeps in silk on linen sheets
With a view of the ocean
Caressed by the breeze
She forgot why she came here in the first place

Caroline, Caroline
Caroline, come back around
Come back around

Caroline, Caroline
Caroline, Caroline
Caroline, Caroline
Come back around
