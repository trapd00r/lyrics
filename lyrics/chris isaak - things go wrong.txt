Trying to rememeber what I know I should forget.
Trying to forget her but I really haven't yet.
Things go wrong, things go wrong.

Trying to rememeber what it was I said you'd done.
Really doesn't matter cause your still my only one.
Things go wrong, things go wrong.

I know that love is sometimes chained.
But in my heart I feel the same.
Don't be so quick to say we're through.
Things go wrong, but I still love you.

Things go wrong, things go wrong.
Don't tell me that your love has changed.
Don't tell me it can't be the same.
Don't be so quick to say we're through.
Things go wrong, but I still love you.
I still love you, I still love you, I still love you.
