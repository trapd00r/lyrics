[Ice Cube]
Slippin, slidin, glidin LOW-ridin
Ain't no hidin from this hit
Fool -- you know how we do it

West Side
I'm comin from the West Side
Wessyde, it's hittin on the West Side..
Yeah, fool..

Ain't nuttin goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin six on artillery, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin, ain't no stoppin
Fo'-hoppin, ass droppin, Coupe DeVille
My truth can kill - fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Wessyde, it's bumpin on the East Side
It's slammin on the South Side
Makin noise on the North Side

[Ice Cube]
Chillin with the homies, smellin the bud
Double parked, and I'm talkin to Dub
about who got a plan, who got a plot
whom got got, and who got shot
Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin out the window
"Fool I got them bomb-ass tapes"
Da Lench Mob,  Planet of the Apes 
I'm down with Eiht, and  Watts Up 
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want "The Bomb," just like George Clinton
S-K-D is down to catch a body
Put on  Knee Deep , we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Fool, you know how we do it
I'm hittin on the West Side
It's bumpin on the East Side
Slammin on the South Side
Makin noise on the North Side

[Ice Cube]
Now Jack B. Nimble, and Jack B. Quick
if you wanna jack me on a lick, cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With "Mo' Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash
Mash up, Ve-nice, headed for the West 
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin
Stashin a glock and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it -- and
You can't fade the R-E-M-I-X
Goin to the bank cashin big fat checks
What's next on the menu?
Got a big fat booty to attend to, ooh
with the rhythm it takes to dance to but
we got to live, too
Mobbin and robbin and squabbin and stealin
K-Dee and me, I got the feelin
and won't be happy til I'm platinum loc'
The mic smoke (and all the hoes are broke)
The freshest MC in the world, who is?
(You is) You know how we do it

Fool, you know how we do it
I'm hittin on the West Side
It's bumpin on the East Side
Slammin on the South Side
Makin noise on the North Side
