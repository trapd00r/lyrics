There's a drawback in
Living for the moment
In loving life too much
Everytime you're lost in love
You wonder when
The love will stop
I'm lost in love

There's a price to pay
If you want to enjoy
The present time
To be that thankful
Demands that you're
Always carrying
Death in mind
Death is around

There's a point to
Put off some things
And save them
For a rainy day
Only those about to die
Are acting in a perfect way
Who wants to die

There's an answer
To why you can
So rarely take in
What you see
The pleasure is followed
By a fear you want
To avoid to feel
I'm so lost in love

There's a freedom
In making plans
To think about a future
And there's a comfort
In being sure
That it'll be long
Before the end
I'm not making plans

There's a reason
To why so many
Only get one little chance
If the song
Was sung forever
No one would
Ever stop to dance
