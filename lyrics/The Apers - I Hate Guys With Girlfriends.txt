I've been a member of this club
For way too many years
All we really do is sit and drink
And listen to The Queers

Well, I know it sounds pretty dumb
But we've got no other choice
Yeah, I rather would be hanging out
With Becky, Kate or Joyce

'Cause I hate, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Well, I hate, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Yeah, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Well, I hate guys with girlfriends, yeah

Every time I see them walking by
I'm about to lose my cool
'Cause they always make me realize
That I am such a fool

Why can't I be like normal guys
And have a proper girl
Well, I hope there's still one left for me, yeah
Somewhere in this world

'Cause I hate, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Well, I hate, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Yeah, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Well, I hate guys with girlfriends, yeah

There's nothing more to say, there's nothing I can do
There's nothing that will make me happy
Well, I'm still all alone, every single day
Well, I guess it was meant to be, yeah

But don't misunderstand
(Don't misunderstand)
I still want to have a girlfriend
But as long as I'm alone
(As long as I'm alone)
I'll keep singing this stupid song, over and over and over

'Cause I hate, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Yeah, I hate, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Well, I hate, I hate guys with girlfriends
(With girlfriends)
Well, I hate guys with girlfriends, yeah

Yeah, I hate guys with girlfriends, yeah
Well, I hate guys with girlfriends
I hate guys with girlfriends
I hate guys with girlfriends
