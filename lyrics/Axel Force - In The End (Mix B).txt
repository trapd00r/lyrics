[Verse 1]
I wanna know
The structure of your heart
Why do you tear
My broken soul apart?
Is it a dream?
Or my reality?
Love comes without
after warranty

[Chorus]
Ooo I want to runaway
You tell me nothing else but lies
I'm singin'
Ooo I try to runaway
Cause I just want to live my life
I'm singin'
Ooo I want to runaway
As long as you are by my side
I'm singin'
Ooo I try to runaway
But I can't find a place to hide

[Verse 2]
No, I am not
You're f*c*i*g second choice
No, I am not
Turning down my voice
Until you understand
There's nothing to command
Until you realize
That we can touch the skies
Can you feel?
It's out of control
Can you feel?
There's nothing at all

Ooo I want to runaway
You tell me nothing else but lies
I'm singin'
Ooo I try to runaway
Cause I just want to live my life
I'm singin'
Ooo I want to runaway
As long as you are by my side
I'm singin'
Ooo I try to runaway
But I can't find a place to hide
