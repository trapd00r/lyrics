Why don't you kidnap me for old times sake
And I'll come break into your house again
I know you love it when I show you that I really care
I never felt so safe when I'm lying on your favorite chair

Of a new day a new day a new day
It's a new day a new day a new day

Why don't I break all of the rules we made
Why don't you throw me in the pool just like that day
We used to stay up so very very late
We used to play our favorite songs until the first sign

Of a new day a new day a new day
It's a new day a new day a new day
