All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their TV screens
To hear the government about to speak
'Bout soldier boys and Jesus Freaks
They go on heaven on their holidays
The congregation hopes and prays
They leave their letters in the mail box
For lonely souls they could not save

Off and on I used hear the call
But she was just a baby doll
And all around them were the holy men
Who twist the words of way back when
She will kiss the sky
And shelter all the world from the rain
Put on a record on the jukebox
She might dance the night away

On and on we go
And the rest of this world
Outside may soon explode
And there's no place we might hide

On and on we go
And the rest of the world
Outside may soon explode
And there's no place we might hide
On and on we go
And we kiss this world
Goodbye and on and on
And on and on

All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their TV screens
To hear the government about speak
'Bout soldier boys and Jesus Freaks
