Yeah, I've been lookin' all over his place
For something missing or some little change
Thought I could see a sign in his face
Oh, what a waste? I can't help it
I think I'm fallin' out of his sight
The smiles around him is catching his eye
Confirm my suspicion, I bet, I am right
Oh, what a waste? I can't help it
Every night, I wonder who do you dance for?
Who's got your heart and who do you care for?
(Every night)
I'm only throwin' it away, away
(Every night)
I think I'm losing all the way, way
Yeah, I've been sitting alone for so long
With a war in my head, wondering where you have gone
Don't be surprised, I was never that strong
Oh, not again, I can't take it
One little victory is all I need
I'm tied to his arm but still I don't see
What it is that I got that brings him back to me
Oh, not again, I can't take it
Every night, I wonder who do you dance for?
Who's got your heart and who do you care for?
(Every night)
I'm only throwin' it away, away
(Every night)
I think I'm losing all the way, way
Every night I wonder who do you dance for?
Who's got your heart I'm not taking a chance no, no, no
Oh, what a waste? I can't help it
Every night, I wonder who do you dance for?
Who's got your heart and baby, who do you care for?
(Every night)
Every night, I wonder who do you dance for?
(Every night)
Who's got your heart I'm not taking a chance no, no, no
(Every night)
Every night, every night
(Every night)
Every night, every night
(Every night)
Every night, every night
(Every night)
