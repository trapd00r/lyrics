We can be savages running wild
Watching the world spinning round
We can be anything

Savages running wild
Watching the world spinning round
We can be anything

We can be anything
We can be savages
We can be anything
We can be savages

We can be like roses when they bloom
We can be young, just me and you
We can climb the mountains
Let them wonder why

Everyday we live like is the last
Counting the stars, we don't keep track
Places that we've never seen before
Follows our hearts

We can be savages running wild
Watching the world spinning round
We can be anything
Savages running wild
Watching the world spinning round
We can be anything

We can be anything
We can be savages

We can be savages running wild
Watching the world spinning round
We can be anything
Savages running wild
Watching the world spinning round
We can be anything
