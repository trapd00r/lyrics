Melanie C:
Oh, say you'll be there

All:
I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring
This I swear

Emma:
Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now, we're going 'round in circles
Tell me will this déjà vu never end? Oh

Melanie B:
And now you tell me that you're falling in love
Well, I never ever thought that would be, eh
This time, you gotta take it easy
Melanie B and Emma:
Throwing far too much emotions at me

Victoria and Emma:
But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

All:
I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring 
This I swear (Emma: I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you 
Is a promise you will be there
Emma: 
Say you will be there, ow
Melanie B:
Say you will be there
Won't you sing it with me?

Geri:
If you put two and two together 
Geri and Melanie C:
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
Geri:
If you can't work this equation 
Geri and Melanie C:
Then I'll guess I'll have to show you the door

Victoria and Emma:
There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid

I'm giving you everything (Melanie B: I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring (Melanie B: All that joy can bring)
