They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
That glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the boys are something else on Broadway
Yeah, but looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

They say that I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But they're wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit 'till I'm a star on Broadway

I'm gonna make it yet
I'll be a big, big star now
I'll have my name in lights
Everybody's gonna know me, yeah, all over town
