[Intro]
Oh lordy, good god

[Chorus (Condensed)]
What ever happened to the DJ
Have you seen him?
Shit, people treat him like he in a museum
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1—2—3, like this

[Verse 1: Bliss & Eso]
We jumped on a plane and we flew to America
First tour there, and we were new to the area
Hit every state and saw a lot of shows
Supposedly the home of hip-hop, well I don’t know
‘Cause we saw a ton of rappers but it totally seems strange That every single one of them was missing a DJ
But if you’re missing a DJ
Then you’re pretty much a karaoke singer, man, and that’s on the real mate
What happened to the cuts? What happened to the mix?
What happened to the juggle? What happened to the tricks?
Shit! The DJ was the god damn man
In hip-hop he's a good damn band
Now kids these days, part of the new school
You ask them about Kool HERC, they be like Kool- Who?
Ah well, there ya go
Shit, Angel Haze hadn’t heard of Biggie till a couple fucking years ago
Fuck CDJ’s, stop being absurd
Real DJ spins, 33 and a third
Yeah, let’s give hope to the people
Save the culture, bring the dope through the needle

[Chorus (Extended 1)]
What ever happened to the DJ
Have you seen him?
Shit, people treat him like he in a museum
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1, 2, 3, like this
DJ, where’d he go?
People act like they don’t know
It all started from scratch, let’s set it straight
With a kick and a snare, yeah, them's the breaks
"D—D—DJ"
"Izm"
What ever happened to the DJ?
"Baddest DJ in the land"
What ever happened to the DJ?
"1—2—3"
What ever happened to the DJ?
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1—2—3, like this

[Verse 2: Bliss & Eso]
Damn right, better give me lee-way
‘Cause I don’t go nowhere without my Dj
Yeah, B.n.E handle the rap
And DJ Izm is "the man on the wax"
Turntables get blessed when you touch it
‘Cause all you do on the daily is cut sick
Don’t believe me? Watch and see
The whole crowd shit bricks when he drops the beat
Yeah, that’s how it makes you feel
Sucker DJ can't fake the real
It’s pretty hard to find a true mastermind
Like Q-Bert, A-Trak or Mix Master Mike
"Yo DJ," can you play my track?
"Yo DJ," you know where it’s at
"Yo DJ," you got balls like boulders
"Smacking ya head dead off ya motherfucking shoulders"

[Interlude 1: Scatches & Eso]
"Go and do some stupid shit"
Ayo, Izm man can I have a tickle on the tech, please?
"Don't touch the turntable" "Yeah"
"Don't touch the record" Why not, mate?
"You're going to ruin it" Alright then, you ready?
"Now you're ready to go?" "I'm ready to go
Now come on, crank this mother fucker up"

[Chorus]
What ever happened to the DJ
Have you seen him?
Shit, people treat him like he in a museum
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1, 2, 3, like this
DJ, where’d he go?
People act like they don’t know
It all started from scratch, let’s set it straight
With a kick and a snare, yeah, them's the breaks

[Interlude 2: DJ Hurricane]
Yeah, yeah, what up. It's the legendary, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, DJ Hurricane of the Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C.. I'm representing Hollis, Queens, New York, and I'm chilling with my homies Bliss n Eso. Save the culture. Support the DJ. You heard.

[Chorus (Extended 2)]
What ever happened to the DJ
Have you seen him?
Shit, people treat him like he in a museum
Acting like he ain't built this bitch
With the 1, 2, 3, like this
DJ, where’d he go?
People act like they don’t know
It all started from scratch, let’s set it straight
With a kick and a snare, yeah, them's the breaks
"Why these motherfucking DJs don't scratch on these rap records no more?
What ever happened to the DJ?
"'Cause they can't scratch, man. They get up there on stage, man. Act like they gon' scratch..."
What ever happened to the DJ?
"They ain't scratching nothing but they ass" "Yeah, I guess"
What ever happened to the DJ?
"What do you think I should do then?"
"Just start tearing up shit"

[Scratches: DJ Izm]
"Mad izm"
"Smacking your head dead off your motherfucking shoulders"
"Izm bring the wisdom—Izm bring the wisdom"
"Mad izm"
"Showing suckers how it's done"
"You got knocked the fuck out, man!"
"Shit, if this is gonna be that kind of party, I'm gonna stick my dick in the mashed potatoes!"
