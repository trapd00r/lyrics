My mind has been shut down
My friends have been let down
What is the reason?
There's millions of reasons

Single me out (single me out)
Tear off my front
Make me expose what I conceal

Life is a bullet
The bloodstains will prove it
It's tearing through you and me
Not caring about you or me

Now I could explain everything
You cursed the fire, now fuck the flame
What is the reason?
There's millions of reasons

Blindfold me now (spin me around)
Spin me around
Picking me up
When I fall down

Life is a bullet
The bloodstains will prove it
It's tearing through you and me
Not caring about you or me

Today I feel blue
My head is in the clouds
Separate me
My soul from my body

Today I feel blue
My head is in the clouds
Separate me
My soul from my body

I'm feeling so lonely
I'm not the only one
Separate me
My soul from my body

'Cause I'm in love with too many things
And I hate everything

Single me out (single me out)
Tear off my front
Make me expose what I conceal

Blindfold me now (spin me around)
Spin me around
Picking me up
When I fall down

'Cause life is a bullet
The bloodstains will prove it
It's tearing through you and me
Not caring about you or me

I'm in love with too many things
And I hate everything
