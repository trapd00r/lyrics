Remember when I caught your eye
You gave me rainbows and butterflies
We did enjoy our happiness?
When our love was over
I was such a mess

I smiled at you
And you smiled back
That's when I knew
There?s no turning back
You said you loved me
And I did too
Now though it's over
I still love you

You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the start

I tried to fight it
I tried so hard
And every day
I pray to god
That you and me were meant to be

But you had another
You had a lover

And now is gone
I don't know why
I feel like crying
Just want to die
I can't look at you
And you know why
No, I tried so hard
To catch your eye

You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the start

You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the start
