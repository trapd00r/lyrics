'Cause we're worlds apart but it's time to know
That the hardest part is to not let go
While the heart keeps beating
The brain keeps wanting
How can I fly if you won't give me wings?

Burn
Cinders of time
Come on and get to me now
Shoot
The stars in the sky
Come on and get to me, get to me

Burn
Cinders of time
Come on and get to me now
Shoot
The stars in the sky
Come on and get to me, now

'Cause you make it hard to believe in you
'Cause you close your eyes to what we do
And as we keep paying
We keep dying
How can I fly if you won't give me wings?

Burn
Cinders of time
Come on and get to me now
Shoot
The stars in the sky
Come on and get to me, get to me

Burn
Cinders of time
Come on and get to me now
Shoot
The stars in the sky
(Because you say)...

Drugs in the hands of a dealer
They're no cure
Drugs in the hands of a doctor
You all want more
Drugs in the hands of a dealer
They're no cure
Drugs in the hands of a doctor
You all want more

And it don't take a genius to work it out
That you're saving face just to stay in power
And as we keep paying
We keep dying
How can I fly if you won't let me be?

Burn
Cinders of time
Come on and get to me now
Shoot
The stars in the sky
Come on and get to me, get to me

Burn
Cinders of time
Come on and get to me now
Shoot
The stars in the sky
(Because you say)...

Drugs in the hands of a dealer
They're no cure
Drugs in the hands of a doctor
You all want more
Drugs in the hands of a dealer
They're no cure
Drugs in the hands of a doctor
You all want more

You've got to give them what they what
(Your only love is just a game)
You have to give them what they want
(Find a way to ease the pain)
You need to give them what they want
(Your only love is just a game)
You have to live through what they want
(Find a way to ease the pain)

(Because you say)...

Drugs in the hands of a dealer
They're no cure
Drugs in the hands of a doctor
You all want more

They're no cure
You all want more
