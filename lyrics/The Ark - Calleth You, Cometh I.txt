And I know we were both too young
way back when we had our thing
And you're not the one that I think of
everytime that the telephone rings
And I know that what we had
would not be called love by the ones we know
And I know it's been many years
and a hundred love-affairs ago

I know all that so well,
but I also do know this
Calleth you, cometh I
And that's just how it is,
and how it's always been 
It's where my reason stops
and something else comes in
I know it doesn't make sense, but still 
Calleth you, cometh I
That's how it is...

And I know we became restrained
everytime we were among friends
And I know how it was last time
and how bitterly it always ends
And I know we were both too young
to know what real love would be like 
And I know that our communication
didn't always work out right

I know all that so well,
but I also do know this
Calleth you, cometh I
And that's just how it is,
and how it's always been 
It's where my reason stops
and something else comes in
And I know it doesn't make sense, but still
Calleth you, cometh I
That's how it is...

And I've been waiting for this so long...
Waiting to sing this song, for you...
Calleth you, cometh I

And I've been waiting for this so long...
Waiting to sing this song, for you...
Calleth you, cometh I
