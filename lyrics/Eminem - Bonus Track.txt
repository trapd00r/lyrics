Psst..
Hey, Listen

I love my job
It makes me feel like... superman
Can you fly?
I can
Wanna see?

[Chorus]
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me... entertain you

[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congress HAS
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope there's a spark
But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious
It might be confusing
Trying to seperate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it?
I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin' constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone re-building
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy ?
Probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then...

[Chorus X1]

[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see thats why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make
"Slim you're great"
But wait, can't you see im only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it
But its inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that i've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And its such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust

[Chorus X1]
