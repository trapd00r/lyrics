A dyin' flame. You're free again.
Who could love, and do that to you?
All dressed in black. He won't be comin' back.
Well save your tears.  You got years and years.
The pains of seventeens, unreal they're only dreams.
Save your cryin' for the day.

Fool if you think it's over, cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over,  I'll tell you why.
Newborn eyes always cry with pain at first look at the morning sun.
Fool if you think it's over. It's just begun.

Miss Teenage Dream, such a tragic scene.
He knocked your crown and ran away.
First wound of pride, and how you cried and cried
Well save your tears, you got years and years

Fool if you think it's over.
Fool if you think it's over.

I'll buy you first good wine.
We'll have a real good time.
Save your cryin' for the day.

Fool if you think it's over, cause you said goodbye.
Fool if you think it's over, I'll tell you why
Newborn eyes always cry with pain at the first look at the morning sun.
Fool if you think it's over. It's just begun.

Newborn eyes always cry with pain at the first look at the morning sun.
Fool if you think it's over. It's just begun.

Fool if you think it's over.
Fool if you think it's over.
