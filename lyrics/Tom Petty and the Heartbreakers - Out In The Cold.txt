The day fell down, the air got cold
I walked out in the street
Daydreamed for a mile or two
Staring at my feet like a working boy
Out of luck, falling through the cracks
night rolled in, I turned back home
A hard wind at my back

[Chorus:]
I'm out in the cold, body and soul
There's nowhere to go
I'm out in the cold

When I woke up my brain was stunned
I could not come around
I reached out to grab my keys
And tumbled to the ground
I thought of you starry-eyed, I wonder where we stand?
Did I just fall from your arms
Down into your hands?

[Chorus]

I'm standing in a door-way
I'm out walking 'round, hands in my pockets

[Chorus]
