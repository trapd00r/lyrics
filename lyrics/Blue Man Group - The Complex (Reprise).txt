I work on the highest floor.
There's nothing in my way.
But I saw my picture on the bathroom door today.
I don't feel like working anymore, is that O.K.?

So far in
I can't get out
So far in
I can't get out
I'm so far in
I can't get out

I made it to the highest floor by working everyday.
But I can't remember what it was like to play.
If I could only find the exit door, I'd run away.

I'm so far in
I can't get out
I'm so far in
I can't get out
So far in
I can't get out
Can't get out
Get out

Gotta get up
Gotta get up
Gotta get up and go.
Gotta get up
Gotta get up
Gotta get up and go.

Gotta get up
Gotta get up
Gotta get up and go.

Gotta get up
Gotta get up
Gotta get up and go
