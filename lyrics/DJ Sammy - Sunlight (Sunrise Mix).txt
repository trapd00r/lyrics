I'm drifting away somehow
By the presence of the morning sun
I'm falling into the night
As I can see you shining bright (shining bright...)

I'm drifting away somehow (I'm drifting away)
By the presence of the morning sun
I'm falling into the night (I'm falling into...)
As I can see you shining bright

Sunlight
There's nothing like your warm embrace
It feels so right
Shining on your sculptured face

Sunlight
There's nothing like your warm embrace
It feels so right
Shining on your sculptured face
(Shining on your sculptured face)

It feels so right
Shining on your sculptured face

There's nothing like your warm embrace
It feels so right
Shining on your sculptured face
