Haven't you noticed there is someone outside
Looking through our window when we sleep at night
You must not leave me alone anymore
Awake all night worried for

You to be with somebody else
Time to be with somebody else

Didn't I tell you about the dream I had last night
We were both in it and everything seemed so right
When I opened up my eyes see you standing beside our bed
Don't remember the look on his face, but I remember
I remember what he said

To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
For one to hold and for want you
It's time for you to be with someone like me

Somebody touched me and whispered in my ear
Come a little bit closer there's nothing for you to fear here
So I left your side and followed my own voice now
The window was open but he was gone
And I went back to you

To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
For one to hold and for want you
It's time for you to be with somebody outside
