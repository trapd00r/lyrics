Walk on the dusty road without any shoes
See all the people out there singing the blues
I've got my trouble but I'm paying my dues
It isn't easy but there's too much too lose 

Many's the time I have wandered alone
Looking this way and that for something unknown
But where can a good king go without his throne? 

Many's a good man lost in his prime
The part of the fortune took him well before his time
He's got his trouble but I've still got mine
Got to find some freedom before I start to decline 

The moon is rising and I'm still on my own
This must be life I guess the seed has been sown
But where can a good king go without his throne? 

Where can he go? Who can he see?
Is there anybody? It's easy to be
Find him a stairway find him a tree
And while you're doing it 
Please won't you find one for me 

The unbeliever says it's hard to believe
I'm told the preacher frowns on those who deceive
The winds of winter stealing the leaves from the trees
The path of fortune is getting closer to me
The snow is falling and the truth is obscure
I think of all the things my soul has endured
Cursing this loneliness that can't be cured
