Sex on the phone
I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone
I need it so
Okay, I do what you'll say
Come on

Just make me fly
Just make me cry
Just make me come
And get me high

Rap1:
Baby this is number one
And we'll have a lot of fun
Baby this is number two
And I tell you what to do
Baby this is number three
Feel my hand right on your knee
Baby, baby, just relax
Max will give you telephone sex

Sex on the phone
I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone
I need it so
Okay, I do what you'll say
Come on
And give me
Sex on the phone
So I can feel
Your sex on the phone is really real
Your touch, I want it so much
I want sex on the phone

Just make me fly
Just make me cry
Just make me come
And get me high

Ahhh, Ahhh

Rap2:
Baby this is number four
Just lie down on the floor
Baby this is number five
Make your fingers come alive
Baby this is number six
And I know you know the tricks
Don't want you to get perplex
Just enjoy the telephone sex

Sex on the phone
I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone
I need it so
Okay, I do what you'll say
Come on
And give me
Sex on the phone
So I can feel
Your sex on the phone is really real
Your touch, I want it so much
I want sex on the phone

Just make me fly
Just make me cry
Just make me come
And get me high

Ahhh, Ahhh
Ahhh, Ahhh,
Just make me fly

Sex on the phone
I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone
I need it so
Okay, I do what you'll say
Come on
And give me
Sex on the phone
So I can feel
Your sex on the phone is really real
Your touch, I want it so much
I want sex on the phone

Just make me fly
Just make me cry
Just make me come
And get me high

Sex on the phone
I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone
I need it so
Okay, I do what you'll say
