(You see)

I traded fame for love without a second thought
It all became a silly game, some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for, wanted it so badly
Running, rushing, back for more, I suffered fools so gladly
And now I find, I've changed my mind

The face of you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love

Traveled 'round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who've settled for the thrill
Basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

The face of you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love

Famous faces, far off places, trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger, drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal, no laughter in the dark
No one night stand, no far off land, no fire that I can spark

The face of you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you, my substitute for love
My substitute for love

(You see)

And now I find
I've changed my mind

This is my religion
