Uhn, smack, there goes my baseball cap I'm on the floor,
I think I took a bruse to my jaw,
Jumped me from behind at least three, maybe four,
I never see my hat no more.


Oh, smash (..smack). There goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
Oh, smash (..smack), there goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.

14 years old and hard to the core,
I'm walking home making plans for war,
My hands was cut, my uncle says 'what's up?'
Let me guess, your clothes are in a mess, you're in distress,
Sit down, take five and let me look at your knees,
Your still alive son, please take it easy
Sometimes you have to let the world know you ain't bluffing,
But enough is enough, don't lose your life over nothing,
Scuffling in the street is no way to die,
And I don't want to have to meet your mama's eye,
So try and listen hard before you fall into the trap
Of making war over a baseball cap.

Oh, smash (..smack). There goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
Oh, smash (..smack), there goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.


I sat back, had a think
My uncle poured a drink
I had a little cry, my eye started to blink
'Cause what occurred from his word to me
Sounds absurd, but I
Heard the love in his voice for me
I made a choice, It was like Snap,
What's a cap when I got something real like that
I can measure it, treasure it, and at my leisure
Sit down with those who mean the most to me
The baseball cap was a ghost, this is real to me
"You got steel, son" My uncle's talkin'
"Takes a champion to walk and keep walking"
"Drink your drink, and let the words sink in,
Say goodnight to your mom and think again"
So I took my 14 years up to bed
Everything he said taking root in my head
I shed all my tears, and let my 14 years
Relax...

Oh, smash (..smack). There goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
Oh, smash (..smack), there goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
