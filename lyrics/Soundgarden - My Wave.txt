Take, if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels all right

Break, if you like the sound
If it gets you up
If it turns you down

Share, if it makes you sleep
If it sets you free
If it helps you breathe

Don't come over here
Piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it
Off my wave

Yeah, keep

Cry, if you want to cry
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes

Hate, if you want to hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave

Pray, if you want to pray
If you like to kneel
If you like to lay

Don't come over here
Piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it
Off my wave

Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave

My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave

Cry, if you want to cry
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes

Hate, if you want to hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave

Take, if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels all right

Don't come over here
Piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it
Off my wave

Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave

My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, hey
My wave, my wave, my wave, my wave, my wave

Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave, my wave

Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off (keep it off, keep it off, (my wave)
(Keep it off)
My wave, my wave (my wave, my wave)
Keep it off my wave
Keep it off my wave
(Keep it off my wave, keep it off my wave, keep it off)
