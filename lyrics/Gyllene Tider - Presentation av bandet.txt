Waiting on the dance,
To get started.

Hollywood stands, it's jammed down
Hoo cha!
It's a party now.

I wanna dance,
I wanna dance,
Everybody wanna dance,
Move those bodies around

While the music spins,
Get down, get down, get down.
Get...

Break out!

Freaks on the floor.
Freaks on the floor.
All the freaks on the floor,
On a saturday night.
Disco is explode.
Strange freaky vibes

Flashing lights of red,
Blue, yellow and green.
It's a funky scene.
Ready for the hit

Get on your knees.

[Chorus:]
It's gonna be an all night thing.
It's gonna be an all night thing.
Baby, it's an all night thing.
It's gonna be an all night thing.

Yeah, yes it is. Uh huh.

Baby...
