Clock on the wall keeps ticking away
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay

Yo, I've been walking 'round in the streets of these cities
I've tipped a few whiskeys, I've rolled a few ditties.
I made a few dollars, I've bought a few bottles
I popped a few collars, and rocked a few models
I pushed a few buttons, left all you cats guessing
It's Wedo Garcia, bitch, who you stressing?
I'm effervescent, about to drop lessons
I had to kill Whitey, word to the almighty
I'm tailor made and I'm custom fitted
Can't none of you cats do it like I'did it
I might come sing it, I might come spit it
And if you want to take it, try to come get it
You'll get your wig splitted, or get your grill busted
I'm crazy like the Beastie Boys, we're still dusting

Clock on the wall keep ticking away (tick tock and you don't stop)
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay (tock tick and you don't quit, hit it)
Clock on the wall keep ticking away (tick tock and you don't stop)
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay (tock tick and you don't quit, hit it)

Yo, off the dummies instrumental, I spit heavy metal
Never been from the ghetto, keep it mad fundamental
Caaninite devil, Caucasoid rebel
Add some bass, add some treble
And pump up my level
'Cuz mad motherfuckers done bit my (???)
And the game has got biters like dogs have fleas
And all you dick riders get up off your knees
Drinkers turn your bottles up, smokers burn your trees
Learn your ABCs, mind your Ps and Qs
Fuck around, get shot up, wind up on the news
Yo, it's Wedo Garcia, he'a singing the blues
Rocking shiny jewels and some brand new shoes
I love my momma 'cuz she ain't raised no fools
My golden rule is stay holding the tool
What you're doing to your peoples comes back on you
Don't know when the Grim Reaper wants to rendezvous

It's like clock on the wall keep ticking away (tick tock and you don't stop)
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay (tock tick and you don't quit, hit it)
Clock on the wall keep ticking away (tick tock and you don't stop)
I've got to go, but I'd love to stay (tock tick and you don't quit, hit it)

I hear mad motherfuckers say they ready to die
Acting like they don't care, but I swear they lie
Tell you now if they had to look death in the eye
They'd beg and they'd plead and they'd scream and they'd cry
When the Reaper calls, you all RuPaul
You all RuPaul when the Reaper calls
When the Reaper calls, you all RuPaul
You all RuPaul when the Reaper calls
I hear a lot of motherfuckers say they down for the kill
Most of them are just clowns, but they swear they will
Spend a lot of time being down, keeping it real
But I pay more attention to the ones that keep still
You all RuPaul when the Reaper calls
When the reaper calls, you all RuPaul
You all RuPaul when the Reaper calls
When the Reaper calls you all RuPaul

Clock on the wall keep ticking away (tick tock and you don't stop)
