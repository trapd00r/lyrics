Soon I will be here no more
You'll hear my tale
Through my blood
Through my people
And the eagle's cry
The bear within will never lay to rest

Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the Trail of Tears

White man came
Saw the blessed land
We cared, you took
You fought, we lost
Not the war but an unfair fight
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood

Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the Trail of Tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Our souls will join again the wild
Our home in peace and war and death

Wandering on Horizon Road... x2


Hanhepi iyuho mi ihanbla ohinni yelo
O sunkmanitutankapi hena,
sunkawakanpi watogha hena,
oblaye t'ankapi oihankesni hena
T'at'epi kin asni kiyasni he
akatanhanpi iwankal
Oblaye t'anka kin
osicesni mitakuyepi òn
Makoce kin wakan
WakanTanka kin òn
Miwicala ohinni - Hanhepi iyuha
kici - Anpetu iyuha kici yelo
Mi yececa hehaka kin yelo, na
ni yececa sunkmanitutankapi
kin ka mikaga wowasaka isom
Uncipi tuweni nitaku keyas ta k'u
Unwakupi e'cela e wiconi
wanji unmakainapi ta yelo
Anpetu waste e wan olowan
le talowan winyan ta yelo
Unwanagi pi lel e nita it'okab o'ta ye
Untapi it'okab o'ta
Na e kte ena òn hanska ohakap
ni itansni a'u nita ni ihanke yelo


Translation:
"I still dream every night
Of them wolves, them mustangs, those endless prairies
The restless winds over mountaintops
The unspoilt frontier of my kith 'n kin
The hallowed land of the Great Spirit
I still believe
In every night
In every day
I am like the caribou
And you like the wolves that make me stronger
We never owed you anything
Our only debt is one life for our Mother
It was a good day to chant this song
For Her

Our spirit was here long before you
Long before us
And long will it be after your pride brings you to your end"
