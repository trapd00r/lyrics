I'd like to tell you all my bad ideas
I hang them with the good to dilute the awful truth
I've been asleep for nearly fifteen years
All dreams I've never had outweigh the life I'm not yet living
I've felt along the walls of here and there
But nothing ever seemed quite right
So I kissed off into the night
There was a thought, there was a bleeding thread
But nothing ever lasts that long within the confines of my head

I'm here to tell I'm not okay
And all those things you can never say out loud
I want to tell you there was no one that I ever believed in more than you
I want to know if there was anyone you ever believed in more than me

I've terrorized the seas of way back when
This little heart of mine has drunk its weight in blood red wine
A little lost, a little out of time
But as the years begin to creep, I have to hope that I'll be fine

I'm here to tell I'm not okay
And all those things I could never say out loud
I want to tell you there was no one that I ever believed in more than you
I want to know if there was anyone you ever believed in more than me

I'm here to tell I'm not okay
And all those things I can never say out loud
I'm here to tell I'm not okay
And all those other things
I'd like to tell you all my bad ideas
I hang them with the good to dilute the awful truth
I want to tell you there was no one that I ever believed in more than you
I want to know if there was anyone you ever believed in more than me
I want to tell you there was no one that I ever believed in more than you
I want to know if there was anyone you ever believed in more than me
