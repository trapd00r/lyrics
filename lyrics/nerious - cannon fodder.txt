We've planted self-destructive seed
Murder devotion
Earth condemned to bleed
Time is erosion
Global hysteria grows
Tear up and forget your peace
From nothingness it comes
And to nothingness it all goes 

New world disorder
Global sense is insane
Erase all borders
All adore the pain
New world disorder
Universal onslaught
Human cannon fodder
In slaughterous lunacy we'll rot 

Pulsating organic rage
Destruction manifest
Quintessence of pain
Liquidate the cast-off rest 

New world disorder
Pure madness is gained
Erase all borders
Outspread the pain
New world disorder
Universal onslaught
Human cannon fodder
In dismayed frenzy you'll rot 

Die
Slow and painful – die rapid and fast
But your future is clear – you won't last
Soon there'll be only ashes and dust
Firm
Fist of misery
Smash
All was meant to be
We sign the capital sentence to ourselves 

War!!!
