When I talk you like to listen
I really love your kissin'
Baby you're a one of a kind

And baby did I mention
All of the attention
You give me makes me feel so fine

(Only for you)
My body's shaking
When I think of the things that you do

When you're crazy in love
Oh oh oh oh
When you're crazy in love
Oh oh oh oh
When you're crazy in love
There is no top speed limit
It's maximum in every minute of love
Oh oh oh oh
When you're crazy in love
Oh oh oh oh
When you're crazy in love
You're blind your heart's on fire
And nothing else can take you higher
Than love-When you're crazy in love

My head opon your shoulder
Baby when you hold her
The girl is shaking like a leaf
You give the right affection
A kind of chain reaction
Way down to my knees

(Only for you)
My body's shaking
When I think of the things that you do

When you're crazy in love
Oh oh oh oh
When you're crazy in love
You're blind your heart's on fire
And nothing else can take you higher
Than love-When you're crazy in love

(Only for you)
I've been waiting
Wishing my dreams would come true
(Only for you)
Oh my body's shaking when I think of the things that you do

Refr.
