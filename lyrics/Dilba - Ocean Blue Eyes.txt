Take my heart along, when you walk out that door

m not hoping to love or trust anymore

ow nothing has changed and its not the same anymore

ell if Im your biggest secret, if your not supposed to tell

f my love made you think then darling please think again

ecause you wont get to heaven,

hen what you do fits best in hell 


 got lost in your ocean blue eyes

oure not him and Im not the one

o die away forever just to live through a little while

es, I got lost in your deep blue eyes

ove come so quick wish that I knew why

ll regret this ever after, imagining you where mine 


ell, Its a heartless destiny, when the timing is wrong

ts like having chorus, verse and bridge

ogether but it still wont make that song

ow I cant get this together so Ive got to move on.

e had no proof, no evidence.

ot a single line to my defense.

here was not much to talk about we

oth knew, this was the heist

eist of them all, boy when I. 


aby, you where buying time on

y account just to make her smile

ou where never mine, when I
