You shouldn't come here
You still got the look she just left
It makes me wonder
Will anyone be enough to fill the space
Oh
Some part wants to wake up
In a different place
Where the sheets are clean
I know you won't make it
You'll be thinking about her
And of all she could've been

I don't want to remind you

Don't want you distant and dreamy
(Don't want you distant and dreamy)
Don't want you distant and dreamy
(Oh baby don't disappoint me)

I didn't come here
To see you changing face to fit the mess
You feel like starting over
And now you place your bets on a second best
Oh
Maybe I'm just a shortcut
To another bed where your conscious is clear
Let's stay up the kiss that I've got
Keep each other in mind until some other time

I don't want to remind you of her

Don't want you distant and dreamy
(Don't want you distant and dreamy)
Don't want you distant and dreamy
(Oh baby don't disappoint me)

Don't want you distant and dreamy
(Don't want you distant and dreamy)
Don't want you distant and dreamy
(Oh baby don't disappoint me)

Don't want you distant and dreamy
Don't want you distant and dreamy

Don't want you distant and dreamy x5
I don't want you distant and dreamy
I don't want you distant and dreamy
Don't want you distant and dreamy
Don't want you distant and dreamy
I don't want you distant and dreamy
I don't want you distant and dreamy
Don't want you distant and dreamy x8
