Don't treat me like I'm broken
All these words unspoken
I don't wanna fade away
Done holding on to yesterday

The wound is still open
The pain from you keeps poking
I'll keep tryin' to find a way
To get the smile back on my face

When tears come crashing down
Emotions are flooding
My words won't come out
Feels like I'll die
If I can't save myself
Then who's gonna save me
I won't cry for help

I'll be unbreakable, yeah
I'll be unbreakable
I'll be unbreakable, yeah
I'll be unbreakable

My heart's cold, no matter
If I fall, won't shatter
Thought you got the best of me
But I'm not easy to defeat

I'm done with the lies and
All your broken promises
I don't need to fight
'Cause I know how to survive

When tears come crashing down
Emotions are flooding
My words won't come out
Feels like I'll die
If I can't save myself
Then who's gonna save me
I won't cry for help

I'll be unbreakable, yeah
I'll be unbreakable
I'll be unbreakable, yeah
I'll be unbreakable

I'll be unbreakable, yeah
I'll be unbreakable
