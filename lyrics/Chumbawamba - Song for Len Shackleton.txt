I'm not the kind of man
Who'd live a quieter life
Just for a minute's silence

One, two, three, four

Some say it all without a word
Silence can be mightier than the sword

They took the two three five
They turned it upside down
Why run away to the circus
When the world is full of clowns?

"Life has got everything to offer
It's just there for the getting
There, just for the getting"
