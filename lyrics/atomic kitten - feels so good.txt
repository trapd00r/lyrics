It feels so good
I knew that it would
Nothing's gonna take this day away
'Cause it feels so nice
Oh so right
Nothing's gonna take this day away

Was only yesterday
I tried to get away
And now this feeling makes you turn around
I was so very sure
What I was wishing for
And now my feet can hardly touch the ground

'Cause the sun is shining
Holiday timing
I needed something to rescue me
Feeling ordinary
Now I'm ready
So come on with me

'Cause
It feels so good
I knew that it would
Nothing's gonna take this day away
'Cause it feels so nice
Oh so right
Nothing's gonna take this day away

I'm where I wanna be
Life in so bottle me
I took my cares
And left them all behind
I had to get away
Deal with them another day
They're outta sight and out of mind

'Cause the sun's still shining
No denying
Something came along to rescue me
Feeling ordinary
Now I'm ready
So come on with me

It feels so good
I knew that it would
Nothing's gonna take this day away
'Cause it feels so nice
Oh so right
Nothing's gonna take this day away

It's just what I needed
It's an emotional healing
It's a wonderful feeling
Nothing left to lose
Yeah

'Cause it feels so good
I knew that it would
Nothing's gonna take this day away
'Cause it feels so nice
Oh so right
Nothing's gonna take this day away

'Cause it feels so good
I knew that it would
Nothing's gonna take this day away
'Cause it feels so nice
Oh so right
Nothing's gonna take this day away

'Cause it feels so good
I knew that it would
Nothing's gonna take this day away
'Cause it feels so nice
Oh so right
Nothing's gonna take this day away
