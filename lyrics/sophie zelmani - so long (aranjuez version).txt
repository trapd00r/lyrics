I've had my eyes
I've had my ears
To steal from you
For so long
For a sake to fill
A hole that kills
You've made me thrill

I've been wandering
So long
So long, so long

Now I burn
And when i yearn
Everywhile without you
Is too long
Now i'm free
You made me see
It had to be so long

Because I'm gonna love you
So long
So long, so long
