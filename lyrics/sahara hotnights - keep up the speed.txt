It's alright, it's a blast, but they're holding us down
Start it up, try to move without making a sound
It's OK, do you want me to make up your mind?
Guess it is kind of hard to know what we'll find

Straightaway, we're heading for trouble today

Hey, we can do it again if you like
And repeat it again a few times
We can keep up the speed 'til we die

Fired up, it's a smash and we're aiming to score
Carry on, 'cos we're always coming for more

Put our heads together start a blinding raid
Wanna break the record find another way
Get up going now 'cos we're starting off today
Gonna try our best and we might succeed
Working for a change spread another disease
A little more time is all we ever need
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Looking out, watch our backs and we'll keep out of sight
Gonna try to find out what the fuzz is about
