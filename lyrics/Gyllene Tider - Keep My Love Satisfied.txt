Well I've tried to forget you
Tried to close my eyes
And I tried not to accept you
I fooled my mind
You're another guy's baby
And I want you get outside
Oh babe, love is blind
How it stumbles all the time

Staying alive
Till I've done my time
Need you behind
Need you all the time
So please keep you light
Shining bright
Girl I want you tonight
And keep my love satisfied

Well I live. Try to reach you
Hanging on to your home
But your dad said you're tired
Better leave you alone
And your mother kept you busy
Whenever we're inside
That's me, me and my heartache
Won't you calls us tonight?

Staying alive
Till I've done my time
Need you behind
Need you all the time
So please bring your love
Through the wire
Girl I want you tonight
And keep my love satisfied

Staying alive
Till I've done my time
Need you behind
Need you all the time
Oho so please keep you light
Shining bright
Girl I want you tonight
And keep my love satisfied

Staying alive
Till I've done my time
Need you behind
Need you all the time
Oho so please keep you light
Shining bright
Girl I want you tonight
And keep my love satisfied
