You crawled into my bed like a cockroach
The things you said made me lose my head
Like a waterfall
You've got a mouth like a VC-10
But I love you

You've got me in your arms
And your special charms
Ah yah ah yah
You, you got my head in circles
Ooh, loved ya
But I don't want nobody but you

Your mocking laugh at my inhibitions
You made a fuss broke my oedipus on my mothers side
You feel your way like a Sherman tank
But I love you

You're gonna take me there
I don't really care
My yah ah yah
You, you got my head in circles
Ooh, loved ya
And I don't want nobody but you

Turn around to me and bring your Mama
The way she freaks gives me the creeps
She's a mainline mess
You've got to know what you're doin' to your Daddy
'Cause I love you

You've got me in your arms
Ooh, your precious charms
Ah yah ah yah
You, you got my head in circles
Ooh, loved ya
