You and I got something
But it's all and then it's nothing to me, yeah
And I got my defenses
When it comes to your intentions for me, yeah
And we wake up in the breakdown
Of the things we never thought we could be, yeah

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you darlin'
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you fallin'
And I wanted to be, all you need
Somehow here is gone

I have no solution
To the sound of this pollution in me, yeah
And I was not the answer
So forget you ever thought it was me, yeah

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
What do you got to move you darling
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you fallin'
And I wanted to be, all you need
Somehow here is gone

And I don't need the fallout
Of all the past that's in between us
And I'm not holding on
And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here

And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you fallin'
And I wanted to be, all you need
Somehow here is gone
And I want to get free, talk to me
I can feel you fallin'
I know it's out there, I know it's out there
And I can feel you fallin'
I know it's out there, I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone, yeah
I know it's out there, I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone, yeah
