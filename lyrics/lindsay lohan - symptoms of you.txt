There a good kind of pain
And insane kinda sane (when I'm around you [2x])

There a chill in the heat
Feel the sky at my feet cuz I adore you
I cant ignore you

[Chorus:]
I'm not ill I don't need to
Take a pill to fix what you do
Cure can't come through
Cuz baby all I do is suffer from
The symptoms of you

There is a left kinda right
There is a blind kinda sight
Looking at you [2x]
There is no light in the moon and its winter in June
When I'm without you [2x]

[Chorus]

And it trips me off my feet
I think I'm falling in too deep
Do you feel it too

[Chorus 2x]
