oooyeahoooooyeah

When I first saw you, I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought I'd never find
Angel of mine

I look at you, looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
Gonna love you till the end of time
Angel of mine

What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life sent from above
Better than a dream, such a perfect love
And I'll adore you till the end of time
Angel of mine

wooh, angel, yeah mmm

Nothing means more to me than what we share
No one in this whole world can ever compare
Last night awake your move is still on my mind
Angel, angel of mine

What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life(my life) sent from above
Better than a dream such a perfect love
And I'll adore you till the end of time
Angel, angel of mine 

ooh, angel,ooooh, angel 

I never knew I could feel each moment, as if it were new
Every breath I take, or thrust that I make
I wanna share it with you

You came into my life, sent from above
(up above baby baby baby)
Better than a  dream of such perfect love (a perfect love)
And I'll adore you till the end of time
Angel of mine

I look at you, looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
Gonna love you till the end of the night
Angel of mine
