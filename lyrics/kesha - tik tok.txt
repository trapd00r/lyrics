Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy (Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go!)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, imma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tick, tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, imma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tick, tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here!
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us...

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, imma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tick, tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, imma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tick, tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Now the party don't start till I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, imma fight
'Til we see the sunlight

Tick, tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, imma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tick, tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh
