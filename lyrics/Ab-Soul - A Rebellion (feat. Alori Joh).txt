See, I just wanna take my chopper
And aim it right at that copper
Just locked up my partner
... They can't stop us

I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one

Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one
Prolly all on this one
Prolly all on this one

Who's bold enough to rebel?

That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint
That's the jam
Turn it up
Play it again

I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one

I just wanna grab that heater
Run right in the cathedral
Aim it right at that preacher
For miseducating the people

I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one
I might all alone on this one

Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

I just wanna take that banger
And aim it right at my Maker
For placing me 'round all this danger
I can't even trust my neighbor

I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one

Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one

That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint
That's the jam
Turn it up
Play it again
