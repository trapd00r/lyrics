Soul power!

Punk-rock, new-wave, and soul
Pop music, salsa and rock and roll

Master mix those number one [scratch]
Play that favorite song of mine
And accept my calls on the request line
DJ will play just for you
But I gotta get down and show I know how to

Play that beat, why don't you play it for me?
Switch the mix Mr. DJ
Play that beat, why don't you play it for me?
Switch the mix Mr. DJ

It's the joint!

Move it, move it!
Move it or rap on it!

You can play it
And play it and play it and play it and play it
And play it all night long
And I'll listen to it over and over
Again and again and again and again
While you play my song, yes
And I'll keep on dancing and keep on dancing
Having fun until the morning sun
Play it for me, just play it for me!
Hooo... He is the king of every beat
The one man band seven days a week
The passion and pain of radio
Celebrity of every disco
The one with the gifted fingertips
Music is his bag of tricks
Go ahead mister disc jockey
Play that beat
Play it, kick it

Play it for the punk rock
Play it for the hip hop
Play it on the radio
Play it for the G-L-O-B-E
G-L-O-B-E
Play it at the playground
Play it on the street
Play it for Whiz Kid
Just play that beat
