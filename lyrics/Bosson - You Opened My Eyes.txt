Intro:
You opened my eyes
you make me believe
that there is a chance for a guy like me

You opened my eyes
to a whole new world for me

Verse 1:
Baby don't you know
that all I wanted was to be by your side
to find a way to the light through the dark
you saw the man that I was deep inside
ahaaa

There's a voice 
that was screaming inside of my head
now it's quiet and peaceful instead
'cause I have learned from the things that you've said
ahaaa

Chorus:
You opened my eyes
you make me believe
that there is a chance for a guy like me

You opened my eyes
you showed me someone that no one else has seen

You opened my eyes
you bring in the sun
you make me believe I am someone

You opened my eyes
to a whole new world for me

Verse 2:
I was lost
and I was scared I was losing my mind
running away from myself all the time
'cause there was something I was waiting to find
ahaaa

There you were
the sky has send me an angel from above
you gave me strengt and you showed me how to love
for that I'm thankful for the rest of my life
ahaa

Now you're gone
and though it hurts to know you're with someone new
you know I always wanted the best for you
you deserve to get the best in life too
I'm grateful for the time with you
