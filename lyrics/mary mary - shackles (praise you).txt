CHORUS:
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you

In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe
That I can break free
Cause you see I have been bound for so long
Felt like all hope was gone
But as I lift my hands
I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance

~CHORUS~

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
See so much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gonna lose my mind
Lord I know You wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need You to lift this load
Cause I can't take it no more

~CHORUS~

Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So let me go right now

~CHORUS: x3~
