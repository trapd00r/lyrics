Holy water on the brain and I'm losing sleep
Holy bible on the night stand next to me
As I'm raped by another monkey circus freak
Trying to take my indignance away from me

Yeah, Holy water's rusting me (2x)
It's rusting me (2x)

Bloody murder is the best I've heard her scream
Holy devil in the flesh some might believe
And they take thine majesty so seriously
'Cause it's the big lie's more likely to be believed

Damn the water if it's life you want to drink
Mind your mother if it makes you feel at ease
As you're raped by another monkey circus freak
'Cause it's the big lie's more likely to be believed
