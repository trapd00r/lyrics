I just can't seem to blend into society
I hold no hope for this dim simplicity
Of law and order
By whose rules?

I see no rhyme and no reason
I hold no hope for this holy treason
Of love and so soft
By whose standards?
By whose standards?

They tell me, they tell me, they tell me
Yi-I-I
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me, they tell me
All lies
Who is they?

I just can't seem to fit into society
I hold no hope for this dim simplicity
Of law and order
By whose rules?

I see no rhyme and no reason
I hold no hope for this holy treason
Of love and so soft
By whose standards?
By my standards.

They tell me, they tell me, they tell me
Yi-I-I
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me, they tell me
All lies
Who is they?
