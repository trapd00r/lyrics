Here you'll find me in between heaven and hell, my dear
Where nothing's what it seems, it's just as well, I fear 
I'm giving you the creeps
And a farewell kiss to go into the unknown

Saw you standing there outside the music hall
You come out for some air, a certain curtain call
And everyone just stared
When you took the stage that night, something's not right

You're up there, took the stairs to the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning but nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
And they sing along

Help me, help me, won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song
Help me, help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself

Here I'll find you in between heaven and hell again
Where nothing's what it seems, it's just as well my friend
I'm giving me the creeps
And a farewell to arms and legs and heads and heart

You're up there, took the stairs to the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning but nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
Now they sing along

Help me, help me won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song
Help me, help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself
Take me from this hell

You're up there, took the stairs to the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning but nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
And they sing along

Help me, help me won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song
Help me, help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself
Take me from this hell
