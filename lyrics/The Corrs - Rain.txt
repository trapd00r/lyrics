Going crazy in the middle of the night
Slipping, sliding into heavenly bliss
Fallen angel spinning from the light
Slipping, sliding into heavenly lace

But it's all, it's all right now
'Cause we're living for this night for so long now
Yes it's all, it's all right

We are living on hope
We are living on life
Depending on truth until the day we die
We are living on hope
We are living on life
Depending on truth
Until the day we die

Lost and lazy, floating through the dawn
And twisting, turning, in a hazy mist
Guardian angel of silver and ice
Sweeping, sinking in a stream of light

But it's all, it's all right now
'Cause we're living for this night for so long now
Yes it's all, it's all right

We are living on hope
We are living on life
Depending on truth until the day we die
We are living on hope
We are living on life
Depending on truth
Until the day we die

But it's all, it's all right now
'Cause we're living for this night for so long now
Yes it's all, it's all right

We are living on hope
We are living on life
Depending on truth until the day we die
We are living on hope
We are living on life
Depending on truth
Until the day we die
