A Connected One
Amongst others
How many more
Will come?

Chained to a pole
Offered to cosmic winds
The very fabric of my being
Slowly torn apart
And there they are
Watching me closely
Waiting for something
To Happen

They told me
I could be the one
Receiver
Of the truth
I belonged to
The sacred halls
To stay among my own
The connected ones

I was taken by the zekhram
Into the depths of Hydhradh
Swallowed by the fetid maze
Where I will stay
And speak out the truth
For the listeners
Until the flow of prophecies
Runs dry

Curled up on the floor, in a cold cell, I wait
My body in a trance, my mind in the stars
A dream state, wake up calls, a resonance inside my head
But the zealots they know, hunt you down, always find you
If you’ve been contacted

Sent to the temple they gave me a room
Lured in with gold and lust
A sweeter kind of dream, free from fear
The awakening was another story
Chained and cut pain shrouding me
The Zekhrams prepared me
Find out if I tell the truth
Am I blessed or cursed ?

Like a witch, drowning or dying
My judges want to know
Can I tell the words of Ætheria ?

My brain wrapped in technetium
Burning liquid numbing my consciousness
Messenger from our God
My slow death for their prophecies
Soon, another brother to stub for me
