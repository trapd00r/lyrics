There's only two types of people in the world 
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe 
Well baby I'm a put on a show kind of girl 
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first 

I'm like the ringleader 
I call the shots 
I'm a firecracker 
I make it hot 

When I put on a show 
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins 
Spotlight on me 
And I'm ready to break 

I'm like a performer 
The dance floor is my stage 
Better be ready 
Hope that you feel the same 

All eyes on me 
I'm in the center of the ring 
Just like a circus 

Everybody gonna ... just like a circus 

Don't stand there watching me 
Follow me, show me what you can do 

Everybody let go 
We can make a dance floor 
Just like a circus
