Whitney:
um, hey deb?
Deborah:
Mmm, hmm

Whitney
Thank you for being woman enough to come

Deborah:
Whitney, what is this about?

Whitney:
I know he's leaving me for you

Deborah:
Who said that? Who told you that its true?

Whitney:
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?

Deborah:
He told me that he loved me

Whitney:
I heard that

Both:
He told me I was beautiful

Deborah:
How did you know? How did you know?

Whitney:
Cuz I've played that scene before...

Whitney:
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
and you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, cuz it won't last
Same script, different cast

Deborah:
What you're saying could be true,
but how can I take advice from you?

Whitney:
I'm not hating, but I wish the one before me
would have warned me too babe

Deborah:
Don't say no more
la la la la la la la la la la

Whitney:
Uncover your ears, girl

Deborah:
I'm not listening
la la la la la la la la la la

Whitney:
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong,
but I know that you believe me

Whitney:
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
and you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, cuz it won't last
Same script, different cast

Deborah:
It's your fault you didn't love him enough

Whitney:
Oh no...that's the problem, I loved him too much
and when you love him,
he becomes unattracted to you

Deborah:
Oh no he's changed and I'll prove you wrong

Whitney:
No you won't

Both:
So GO AWAY!

Deborah:
Leave us the hell alone
Cause he loves me

Whitney:
He'll hurt you

Deborah:
He'll stay with me

Whitney:
He'll leave you

Both:
For sure, for sure

Whitney:
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
and you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, because this won't last
No, same script, different cast

Deborah:
This is is a retake of your life
You were his star for many nights
But now the roles have changed
and i'm the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera now i'm on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, cuz this will last
I'm his future, you're his past

Whitney:
This is is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
and you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, cuz this won't last
Same script, different cast
