I'ma make it hot like fire
I'ma make it hot like fire

You're hotter than a summer day in California
Ya got me meltin' like a sundae
And I want ya
I know you've been waitin'
You've been waitin' a long time for me
But if you wait a little while longer this is how it'll be

Oh it's gonna be, hot like fire
I'm gonna take you, take you higher
You can't resist, kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

You shouldn't rush it
Take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready
If that's alright
I won't keep you, I won't keep you
I won't keep you holdin' on
But if you wait on me
I promise you it won't be long

Oh it's gonna be, hot like fire
I'm gonna take you, take you higher
You can't resist, kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

Baby take your time
Take your time, don't move too fast
No no no
Take your time, there's no rushin' babe, no no no
Take your time
Take your time
I'm gonna make it all good for you baby

Hot like fire
I'm gonna take you
Take you higher
You can't resist
When I taste your lips
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss

C'mon, can you feel this?

Ba-baby
