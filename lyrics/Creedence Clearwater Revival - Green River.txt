Well, take me back down where cool water flows, y'all
A-let me remember things I love, Lord
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me home
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, ho
Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water
Shoo, fly, dragonfly, get back, you mother
Pick up a flat rock; skip it across Green River
Well!

Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world be smolderin'
And if you get a-lost, come on home to Green River"
Well!

Come on home
