Well as this cold world
Turns round and round
So much tragedy
Have I found
If I could take it away
I'd do that now
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I smile
So if I go to sleep
Don't wake me up
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I fly away! (x4)
Fly away

So god bless my soul
The pain I feel won't nobody know
'Cause this world is evil
And every time I wake up I wanna go home
So what am I to do
But sing a song for you
'Cause I feel you also
That's why I'll never let you go
They say I lost my mind
But I did that so long ago
So when I close my eyes
Leave me alone

So if I go to sleep
Don't wake me up
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I fly away (x4)
Fly away

Uh, somebody pray for me
I believe I can fly, ya, crazy me
But at night these angels be singing to me
Like lalalalalalalalala
So as I lay awake at night
I drift away into the sky
And that's where I reside
Oh yeah, oh yeah
So pray that I'll be just fine
I see you when it's time
I'll see you when it's time

Well as this cold world
Turns round and round
So much tragedy
Have I found
If I could take it away
I'd do that now
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I smile
So if I go to sleep
Don't wake me up
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I fly away! (x4)
