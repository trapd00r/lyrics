Hey T.I.P pimpin'
Hey shorty why you gotta act like that? I'm sayin'...
I'm just tryin' to be nice to you.

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that...hey-hey.

Can't help but notice how you glowin' I can see in yo face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo' space
Selling niggas is one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo' knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you makin, get yo' knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I gotta mansion and a gate, you wit me you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck wit 23's the case
600 Gz in the safe. How much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today, this somethin' special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing makin' you sad makin' you stay

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that...hey-hey.

Can he touch you like that, and make you make you feel like this
Holla if you came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest
Take advantage of what you concealing in your dress
What, he think he to fresh to show you that you the best
Compliment you on your hair and legs and treat you wit respect
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissin' on yo neck
It's been awhile since she got it like this I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
No, you confused ain't decided which way you should go yet.
So how you keep sayin' no when your panties so wet?

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that...hey-hey.

This nigga playin' mind games man
I think the time came, that you mind changed you understand
Life is like a chess move, you need to make yo next move
Yo' best move, keep it pimpin' you understand...hey
I mean you know what I'm sayin' I done showed you how I feel
You know what I'm sayin' I put myself all the way out there you know
The ball in yo' court man, but I just got a question for you...
Is you happy??

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that...hey-hey.
