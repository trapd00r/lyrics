why do you love me so much?
how come you love me so much?
look, im paralyzed with shock
paralyzed with shock

could it be my awesome looks?
im afraid thats out of the question, my beauty is fleeting
have i won the nobel prize?
oh charm, i must have been sleeping, i must have been sleeping

why do you love me so much?
how come you love me so much?
i dont seem to recover from the shock
recover from the shock

is it the invisible chemistry stuff?
i hope not, the mere thought makes me sick and i wanna throw up
have i by mistake been extra-charming?
oh the chances are alarmingly low

do you want me to love you back?
or is it ok either way?
do you want me to love you back?
how much (?) you got?

its not that i have anything against you
no, i think youre among the best people i have met
and i dont see how i can be unfaithful
to my idea of romance is something slightly out of date

why do you love me so much?
