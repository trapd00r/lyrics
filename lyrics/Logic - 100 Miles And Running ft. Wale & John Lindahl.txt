[Logic:]
Woo, woo, yeah
Alright, here we go
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Money on my mind, so I'm too paid
Real all the time, never Kool-Aid
Sippin' on D'usse, sike
Came a long way from G'burg
Puttin' in work like Ferg
New York, to L.A., Hawaii and Japan
I'm the motherfuckin' man, 'least I'm feelin' like I am
Got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
But don't give a goddamn, I'm Sam, I am
What that even mean? I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Why nowadays everybody got a palm out?
PLP, yeah that be me, and that be what I rhyme 'bout
I have arrived, all you rappers are in timeout
RattPack, where you at? (everywhere worldwide)
I know you been waitin' for this world to collide
B. O. double B. Y., H. A. L. L., and Folarin
'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean
I am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud
All you bitch niggas not allowed?
I put it on everything, I really want a cop out
But I did good for a drop out
Hop out the coupe, chicken heads go crazy
Gotta sound swag when the flow get lazy
What up? What good? Where you at? What you been on?
Anybody steppin' to me, I promise they get shit on
Better hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to..
Hop up on the.. hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to get on
Mixtape Bobby, that's the type of shit I spit on
Whew!

[John Lindahl & Logic:]
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now, (ooh, no, no, no)
(I'll be damned)
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now (ooh, no, no, no)

[Logic:]
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody listening to this right now alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, you gotta survive
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, you gotta survive
I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive

[Wale:]
Smooth criminal, Mike Jack
Throw a subliminal, put your women in black dress
They was in Timberlands, I was reppin' them Nike boots
Remember them nights that momma couldn't come right back
I'm on the path right now, put the plight on the mic
If I write mine down, I incite my crowd
I put Solbiato down (old time, old time)
Used to go to Mark Twain, Mo County co-signed me
Got many flows that any ho would vouch for
I Got many foes 'cause many hoes be out for
Had the Penny Foams, remember those was copper
Had so many homies talkin' 'bout, "how you got those?"
I'm Phil Knight in real life, I'm real Nike
Flight club in my house, they not like me
More than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me
It's a lie, somebody seein' me needs some Visine, yeah
Let me let it breathe, Saint Laurent level, worry never worry me
I'm well aware they be wilding when they talkin' me
They're bitches in the ballot whenever I be on the scene, oh
Hammers in the Uber, I be limousine though
Diamonds lookin' fluke but I got the same glow
And I got a juice back around the way though
My chain like a penguin's, Pellegrino
We cold, we cold
Used to be in Lake Forrest with the Kobe fro
Eddie Bauer coat, Foams, and a load of dope
Boat load of white hoes I sold it to nigga
I was tryna survive, tryna survive
I was tryna survive, yeah, yeah
I was tryna provide, I was tryna survive
I put 'em down every time
I got some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not
Pour a little of brown liquor and look in the sky
Been the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland
Did it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot
Hoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil
Anybody can hear me for real give me their props
Hookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us
The motto is get your paper and make you a lot
Pulling up with Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis
The MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks
And the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'
It's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it
I'll be damned

[John Lindahl & Logic:]
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now, (ooh...)
(I'll be damned)
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now

[Logic:]
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Coming off of the vibe, coming off of the vibe
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, you gotta survive
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Coming off of the vibe, coming off of the vibe
Come on now, come on now
Come on now, you gotta survive
I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
I said you gotta survive

Goddammit, I'm back at it
Never had a breath like an asthmatic, I done had it
Feel this shit, I'm an addict, back in Maryland livin' in the attic
Flowin' erratic, bringin' the static, bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest, hotter than the desert in Nevada
And in the end fuck all of the chitter and chatter, none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen to the pitter and patter, let 'em shatter
'Cause I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin' to kill it
The Ripper, he callin' and we'll go and he'll flow and you know
He pursuin' it, doin' it, movin' it, groovin' it, stoppin' it, rockin' it, talkin' it, walkin' it, flippin' it, rippin' it
No, no, no, no, no!

Oh no, no no no!

This what we gon' do right now. I'ma test my syllalbe ability. You know what I'm sayin'. I like to call this shit my syllablability. I've been sippin' on this tequila right now. This one of the last songs we recorded for this motherfucker so I'ma go off on y'all right now. We gon' do this shit in one breath, alright? This ain't no bullshit. This ain't nah, nah, nah, nah. This ain't no editin'. We gon' do it like this. Are y'all ready? (Yeah) No, no, no, no. Are y'all ready? (Yeah!)

Slicin' emcees like Darth Vader
Decapitate a hater the second I spit it
Say hell yeah
Hell yeah!
Say hell yeah
Hell yeah!
Say hell yeah
Hell yeah!
