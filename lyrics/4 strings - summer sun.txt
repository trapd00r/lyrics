Far away from home
The place where I belong
When I close my eyes
I start to realize
Hold my breath
Trying to forget
Feeling so strong
A new day has come
Summer sun
Summer sun

Summer sun, keep me warm
Nothern light
Come and dry my eyes
Summer sun

When I'm searching for believe
Has to put myself at ease
Everytime I'm on the run
Find me summer sun
Find me summer sun
Far away from home
The place where I belong
When I close my eyes
I start to realize
Hold my breath
Trying to forget
Feeling so strong
A new day has come

Summer sun, keep me warm
Nothern right, come and dry my eyes
Summer sun!
Summer sun!
Uuuoooouuh
Find me summer sun
Uuuoooouuh
Summer sun
