[Verse]
Back in this bitch, back on my shit
She thought I was done, now she back on my dick
Ain't got my new number so she in my DM’s
[?], hope that bitch can swim
Shit a lot different now, let's not pretend
Even had to cut off a couple friends
Niggas'll act like they there on your team
Won’t even clap but congrat' when you win
Main reason why I be low, doing me
Far from you cornballs and out of your reach
Somewhere off the radar, layed up on a beach
Just me and my bitch and I'm squeezin' her cheeks
She don't even smoke and she hittin' the weed
She ain't tryna get high, she just do it for me
All these rappers some lames, don't confuse them with me
Like a polar bear skin, Millzy cool as could be
Uptown nigga in some Uptown’s
She at the baggage claim when I touch down
Used to be fat, lost the gut now
She ride it even better when we fuck now
And I never been known as a rat or sucker
I ride for my brothers, we rep one another
I rep for the hustlers, respect like no other
You get out of line and you get a white cover like blatt
