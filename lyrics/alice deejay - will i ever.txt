Na na na na 

I don't dare to let it show 
Therefore you will never know 
What I really feel inside 
And how I lay awake at night 

Will I ever fall in love 
And if I do will it be with you 
Will I ever fall in love 
And will you be the one for me 

Will I ever fall in love 
And if I do will it be with you 
Will I ever fall in love 
And will you be the one for me 

Na na na na wheeooh nanana 
Na na na na wheeooh 
Na na na na wheeooh nanana 
Na na na na wheeooh 

I guess it's all in my head 
And I will be alone instead 
Dreaming of a night with you 
And all the things that we would do 

Will I ever fall in love 
And if I do will it be with you 
Will I ever fall in love 
And will you be the one for me 

Will I ever fall in love 
And if I do will it be with you 
Will I ever fall in love 
And will you be the one for me 

Will I ever fall in love 
And if I do will it be with you 
Will I ever fall in love 
And will you be the one for me 

Na na na na wheeooh nanana 
Na na na na wheeooh 
Na na na na wheeooh nanana 
Na na na na wheeooh
