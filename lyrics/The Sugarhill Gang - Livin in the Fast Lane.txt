Ah baby

In the fast lane
Ain't nothin' movin' slow
Always on the go
In the fast lane

Check me out!

Runnin' the streets, playin' ya game
Everybody knows ya face, respects ya name
There's an art to the way you make ya cash
But you gotta be smart to make it last
Talk about fly girls and 4-door cars
And runnin' up bills in high class bars
It goes with the job, it's part of the date
If you choose to live your life that way

In the fast lane, come on!

Money, cash money
Money, cash money

You're a fly kid, livin' high on the hog
Got a lot of money, ain't got no job
Your daddy's rich, your momma's good lookin'
Got a live-in maid to do all the cookin'
Poverty never on your mind
Cause you can spend 500 at the drop of a dime
Watch the young ladies that say they're true
Cause they'll play you for a sucker and jerk you, too

Just take a look at your friends, don't be a dummy
Cause all they want is your money
You always gotta watch the things you do
Cause everybody's got their eyes on you
You're in the spotlight, your life is a show
But there's one thing that I'd like to know
When it's all gone, where ya gonna be?
Cause you're out of touch with reality

Livin' in the fast lane
Talk about it!

Money!
Cold, cold cash
Cash money

Talkin' 'bout
Money
Cold, cold cash
Cash money

Give a hit y'all

Forget about a nickel, give me a dime
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
Like, easy come easy go
If I don't get my cash go flow
I made my cold cash in the fast fast lane
And if I lose it baby then I'm to blame
Dom Perignon, filet minon,
Lovin' the afternoon, the babydoll
If you could buy, I know you'd try
Yourself a condo on the Moon
Ladies!

Movin' fast, movin' fast,
Movin' fast, movin'
In the fast lane
Movin' fast, movin' fast
Movin' fast, movin'
In the fast lane

Ain't nothin' movin' slow
Always on the go
In the fast lane

Talkin' 'bout

Cold, cold cash

Think about it!

Take a look at yourself, analyze your life
Do you waste your money, cheat on your wife?
Wake up in the night, go to bed with the sun
Is you main concern just to have fun?
Forsake your family, forget your friends
Until the girls go home and the cash flow ends
Drink alcohol, corrode your brain
From smoking good reefer and sniffing cocaine
Does your life consist of material things:
Fancy clothes, furs and diamond rings?
If any of these things apply to you,
Don't you think it's time to try something new?
Grab a hold of yourself, and take the time
To restore your body, relax your mind
Don't get caught up in a fantasy
You'll see, how easy it can be
Livin' in the fast lane

Talk about it!
