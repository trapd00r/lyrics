Fire sale, chemtrail, apocalyptic hieroglyph
Try to riff, wind up stiff, find a spliff, smoke it
Light the fire, turn it higher, burn a while, work for hire
Your desire, dire stakes get brokered
Colonize, gentrify, do or die, Semper Fi
Simplified sympathy, Marley Marl symphony
Cold chilling, top billing, body count, cop killing
Supervillain rivalry, mighty hard nemesis
March from the genesis to the omega
Hit the bodega, arm-legga-legga
Arm-head mega, shine like Vega
Blackhole, supernova, superlover, Casanova
Golden era terror, Goldyn Chyld whilin'
Reservoir K-9, clans from the Highland
Syndicate assassin, heartbeat's bionic
Ancient masonic, sons of Mantronik

The culling is coming, grab your guns
Stack cash funds, fathers teach your sons
When politicians talk - assume they're lying
Living on your knees - much worse than dying

The culling is coming, grab your guns
Stack cash funds and teach your sons
When politicians talk - assume they're lying
Living on your knees - much worse than dying

Smartphone, spy drone, microphone, God stone
Home alone, Al Capone, Skull & Bone, terror dome
Satellite, socialite, Neophyte, troglodyte
Outta sight, parasite, chocolate white, Canaanite
Satanic Vatican, tyranic architect
Organic archetype, volcanic dialect
Titanic visual, ironic imagery
Iconic ritual, bionic symmetry
Sacred mathematical, live from the tesseract
Surgically tactical, spine of a silverback
Sign of the zodiac, megalo-maniac
Cardiac heart attack, talking red, walking dead
Zombified, Columbine, all the time, fast rewind
Raise the flag, back it out, flood the hood, rack it out
On the news, keep it quiet, sell the lie, make 'em buy it
Make a trial, start a riot, find a threat, classify it

The culling is coming, grab your guns
Stack cash funds, fathers teach your sons
When politicians talk - assume they're lying
Living on your knees - much worse than dying

The culling is coming, grab your guns
Stack cash funds and teach your sons
When politicians talk - assume they're lying
Living on your knees - much worse than dying
