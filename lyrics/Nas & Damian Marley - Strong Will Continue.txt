Nas - Speaking:
All I do is stay focused looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go man. Let's go...

Damian Marley:
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

Damian Marley:
Hey... The victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self defeat is your own dispute
And man you put yourself in a ya own shoeses Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Tay you starring in a ya own movie
Playing of a role you choose so
Stand up and fight if you know say you're right and no you won't ever fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail and the boat shall forever sail
(Hey) There ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Hold gun all di sprinklers and he tell him bust my gat tougher than Zeus

Damian Marley:
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

Nas:
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death New York to Cali for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind 'cause in life you cannot press rewind
Get it right
You only have one first chance to make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputations to proceed itself do you believe in hell?
Babylon, greed for wealth Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skinned, the dark won't take my soul Survived spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evils felt but faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clenched my fist
Ready to go against whoever Tie my Timb's and rise in the end

Damian Marley:
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go

And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

Damian Marley:
No man live forever
But never say never
Every goodie want better
Just be a go getter
And always be clever
In every endeavour
'Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Your girl try to pleasure
From ya neighbours things severe
The land and the treasure
Work for whatever
Jah say don't be a beggar
The alpha omega
Will bless every soul no matter
Which name you prefer
The immortal stepper
Believe in every skin
No matter which colour they are
Will never let you down no matter
Which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the son of Rebecca don't stop for a second
Every man reckon
It sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in

Damian Marley:
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak are to weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

Nas - Talk:
As the weak shall fall to the sideline
I get my kid
I protect mine with a tech 9
Haters want me to side with em
Gangsters want me to ride with em
Ladies want me to make brides with em
I'm on a low I'm in the zone every evening
I'm in the zone every evening walk through the valley of death
I'm still breathing
Give a bit of life to your ethylene
Thief in the night like
America seen
Coming through in the zone every evening
In the zone every evening
I know the strong will survive
