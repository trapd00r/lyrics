My friend's got a bruise on his leg
A bruise on his leg
Every time you speak
My friend's got a bruise on his leg
Where I press my knee
Every time you speak

Actually, bottom line
You tell the truth sometimes
Sometimes you tell the truth
Like you're pulling taffy

My friend's got a bruise on his arm
A bruise on his arm, 
Every time you speak
My friend's got a bruise on his arm
Where i shove my elbow
Every time you speak

Actually, bottom line
You tell the truth sometimes
Sometimes you tell the truth
Like you're pulling taffy

My friend's got a bruise on his ribs
Where I poke my finger
Every time you speak
My friend's got a bruise on his ribs
His rib cage is now numb
Every time you speak

Actually, bottom line
You tell the truth sometimes
Sometimes you tell the truth
Like you're pulling taffy
