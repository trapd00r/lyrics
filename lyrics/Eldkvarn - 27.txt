The Lord is my light and my salvation
The Lord is my stronghold - Whom shall I fear?
When the enemy attacks and I'm surrounded
I will not stumble - Cause Lord You are near

The one thing I ask - The one thing I seek
Is to dwell in Your house O' Lord
The one thing I ask - The one thing I seek
Is to dwell in Your house O' Lord
Just to gaze on Your beauty

Don't hide Your, don't hide Your
Don't hide Your face from me
Cause we will see Your goodness
Yes, we will see Your goodness
