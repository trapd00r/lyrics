Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me offa my feet
And I'm back in the rain
Oh, and you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird
Oh, singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last
I can change I swear
Oh, see what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
Oh I know where I can find you
Oh, in somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way

A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense in changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart
