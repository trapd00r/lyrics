Time may take us apart, but I will still love you, I promise.

And when the stars, stars are falling
I'll keep calling

I promise that you'll be my one, my only everything
I'll never be untrue
And I promise that for all your love I will do anything
I will give you the stars, I will buy you the moon

Even through the longest of our nights
And even through the darkest days
Our love will find a way

And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting
I will still love you

You are my summer breeze, my winter sun
My springtime song, my autumn touch of gold
And you are my sky, my rain, the one for which my love grows strong
The smile in my heart and the breath in my soul

Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold our hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts

And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting
I will still love you

Tell me how you feel
I finally know how love feels
Tell me if its real
And my heart tells me its real
So real, So real

And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting
I will still love you

Time may take us apart, that's true
But I will always be there for you
You're in my heart, you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles between
I promise you that I won't forget
The day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars may too
But I will still, I will still love you

And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting
I will still love you
