My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
And my feet step the beat like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

I close my eyes, close the door
I won't worry anymore
I've been waiting for you
Every day and every night

Cut the light, let it flee
I don't wanna be afraid
I've been waiting for you

Tonight it is right
Stars shine bright
I just really wanna be with you

I celebrate
Pray for the day
When all my wishes will be coming true

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
And my feet step the beat like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
And my feet step the beat like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

I think of you every day
I've been waiting for a call
Just the sound of your voice

I think of you every day
I've been waiting for a call
Just the sound of your voice
Anytime and anyway

Dream of you since that day
When I saw you the first time at the Hardrock CafÃ©

Tonight it is right
Stars shine bright
I just really wanna be with you

I celebrate
Pray for the day
When all my wishes will be coming true

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
And my feet step the beat like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
And my feet step the beat like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

I close my eyes, close the door
I won't worry anymore
I've been waiting for you

My heart beats like a drum, baby

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
And my feet step the beat like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
And my feet step the beat like a drum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

My heart beats like a drum, baby
And my feet step the beat, baby
