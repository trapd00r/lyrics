I remember when I met you
Love was like a burning flame
And your love was warm and tender
Melted me the day you came

And we used to be so happy
Rolling down a gentle stream
Now I realize that all the things
We had was just a dream

Never thought that I would lose you
But it happened anyway
No more love and tender kisses
Cold and lonely is my day

Feeling restless like an eagle
Flying lonely in the sky
Searching for the love you took away
The day you made me cry

And I feel just like an eagle
Flying lonely in the sky
Searching through the land of memories
For the times that did go by
Tho' I don't want to remember
I keep searching for your love
Like a lost and lonely eagle
Flying in the skies above
Flying in the skies above

Guess I always will be searching
For your love and sympathy
Somewhere deep down in your memory
Like the spark of love I need

Like the spark that made the fire
It's the only chance, my friend
So I've got to keep on trying
Till you take me back again

And I feel just like an eagle
Flying lonely in the sky
Searching through the land of memories
For the times that did go by
Tho' I don't want to remember
I keep searching for your love
Like a lost and lonely eagle
Flying in the skies above
Flying in the skies above
