One smile
It was all I needed to see
You hand
Touching the tip of your knee
여보새요
당신은 아름다운 귀를 소지하셨어요
Excuse me?
I don't understand what you say
저를 안아주세요
I can't understand what you say!
그리고 키스해 주세요
But I'm falling in love anyway

When you reach out and kiss me with Asian technique
My heart's beating fast and we suddenly speak
a magical language sent from above
we speak the language of love!

HELLO?
HELLO?
YOU BEAUTIFUL GIRL
It's the language of love
MAN ALSO NICE
It's the language of love
I FEEL RAINBOW INSIDE
It's the language of love
LET'S MAKE BIG FAMILY
It's the language of love

Clear skies
It's a beautiful day at the ZOO
We kiss
But my eyes cannot focus on you
Hello
You're the most beautiful thing I have seen
Come here
Do you want to go dancing with me?

I can't understand what you say!
Come with me, let's run away?

When a man loves a seal and the seal loves a man
The moment a flipper is touching a hand
From a wonder, magical, mystery place
The language of love comes out of their face

ME LIKE YOU
It's the language of love
SEAL LIKE YOU MUCH
HURRY HURRY HURRY
It's the language of love
COME WITH ME
It's the language of love
SEAL LIKES CAR!
It's the language of love

YOU NICE HUMAN
THANKS
I HAVE THINKED
ABOUT WHAT?
WHAT IS LOVE?
LOVE IS THE GREATEST
THING OF ALL
WHEN WE LOVE
WE ALL CAN SPEAK
SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE!
