I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do,

No matter what I do
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you 

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you 


I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me 
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing MY HOOD HAS  seen 
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son THOUGH, but that's okay 
'Cause I wait for my cue and just listen, play my position 
Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything MOMMY hittin' 
And in no time IM GUNNA make this FRIEND mine and that's for sure
'Cause I-I never been the type to break up a happy home 
But uh there's something 'bout baby girl, I just can't leave alone
So tell me, ma, what's it gonna be 
She said you don't know what you mean to me

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you 

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo 
You know I'm crazy over you 

Uh-uh-uh-uh 
I see a lot AND YOU LOOKIN ; I never say a word 
I know how niggas start actin and  trippin' , i heard about  they girls 
And there's no way- Nelly gon' fight ova no damee
As you could see 
But I like your steeze, your style, your whole demeanor 
The way you come through and holler, and swoop me in his two-seater 
Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget it 
But uh it ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him 
But uh you and dirty got ties for different reasons 
I respect that and right before I turned to leave 
She said you don't know what you mean to me, come on 

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you 

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo 
You know I'm crazy over you 

Sing it for me, Kelly 

I love you and I need you 
Nelly, I love you, I do 
And it's more than you'll ever know 
Boy, it's for sure 
You can always count on my love 
Forever more,
