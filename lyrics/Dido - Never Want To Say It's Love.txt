I could put it down to being tired
Or coming home to an empty house
A passing moment, a little mad
No one around to stop me writing to you

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of

I could apologise and say tear it up
And put it down to the pills I've taken
Seeing my friends with their lives moved on
While I've been gently drifting

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of

I felt the same today
As I was feeling yesterday
It'll be the same tomorrow
From then on it won't change

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of

My home is home and I'm settled now
I've made it through the restless phase
I have no reason to get bored anymore
My friends are around and your name comes up
Asking if I ever heard from you
I'm keeping it quiet about those words to you
But I meant every word that I said
I stand by every word that I said

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of

I felt the same today
As I was feeling yesterday
It'll be the same tomorrow
From then on it won't change

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of

I felt the same today
As I was feeling yesterday
It'll be the same tomorrow
From then on it won't change

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of

I never wanna say it's love
But it's really what I'm thinking of
