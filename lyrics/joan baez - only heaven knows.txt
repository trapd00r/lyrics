Seems we've been to heaven darling 
Ah the sad wind blows 
But I have lost my way my darling 
Tell me how it goes 
While the mist is rising darling 
Ah the sad wind blows 
Tell me how we met my darling 
Tell me all you know 

Well I am somewhat older darling 
Ah the sad wind blows 
And you are so much younger darling 
That's the way it goes 
And we looked so good together 
Ah the sad wind blows 
Out of all the summer flowers 
I had picked the rose 

Take me in your arms my darling 
While the sad wind blows 
Tell me that this pain will leave me 
Tell me how it goes 
Ah if this pain should ever leave me 
Only heaven knows
