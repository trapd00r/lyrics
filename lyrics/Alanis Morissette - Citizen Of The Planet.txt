I start up in the north, I grow up from special seed
I sprinkle it with sensibility
From French and Hungarian snow
I linger in the sprouting until my engine's full

Then I move across the sea to European bliss
To language of poets
As I cut the cord of home
I kiss my mother's mother, look to the horizon

Wide-eyed, new ground
Humbled by my new surroundings

I am a citizen of the planet
My president is Kwan Yin
My frontier is on an airplane
My prisons: homes for rehabilitating

Then I fly back to my nest, I fly back with my nuclear
But everything is different
So I wait, my yearn for home is broadened
Patriotism expanded, by callings from beyond

So I pack my things
Nothing precious
All things sacred

I am a citizen of the planet
My laws are all of attraction
My punishments are consequences
Separating from source the original sin

I am a citizen of the planet
Democracy's kids are sovereign
Where the teachers are the sages
And pedestals fill with every parent

And so, the next few years are blurry
The next decade's a flurry of smells and tastes unknown
Threads sewn straight through this fabric
Through fields of every color, one culture to another

And I come alive
And I get giddy
And I am taken and globally naturalized

I am a citizen of the planet
From simple roots through high version
I am guarded by the angels
My body guides the direction I go in

I am a citizen of the planet
My favorite pastime: edge-stretching
Besotten with human condition
These ideals are born from my deepest within
