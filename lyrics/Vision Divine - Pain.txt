There's no tomorrow for you, losers
And no salvation from my pain
So, stop to live in your illusions
Why don't you see we're all unchained?

Oh, come with me
And together we'll be free
'Cause today
It's a good day to die

I am the prince who chose to fall down
I thrown my holy wings away

Oh, come with me
And together we'll be free
'Cause today
It's a good day to die

In this night we're gonna be free forever
Rebel angels, yes we want be free tonight

Blood and fire
Winged shapes of steel
Spit on the ground
Let the war begin
Hail to winners
Now and ever
Pain for losers, pain for me

Oh, come with me
And together we'll be free
'Cause today
It's a good day to die

In this night we're gonna be free forever
Rebel angels, yes we want be free tonight
