Can you believe this, ain't got no money
Can you receive this, shure is no funny

I slave every day for the money, what more can I do
The job that I have is no funny, but what would you do
I've got bills over my ears, that I've got to pay
There's gonna be a lot of tears, each and every day

Can you believe this, ain't got no money
Can you receive this, shure is no funny

I was warned by my father, before I moved out
He says you should bother, tat is no doubt
Now I know what it's trying to say, life is no game
I've got so many depts to pay, I trouble my name

Can you believe this, ain't got no money
Can you receive this, shure is no funny

I slave every day for the money, what more can I do
The job that I have is no funny, but what would you do
Now I know what it's trying to say, life is no game
I've got so many depts to pay, I trouble my name

Can you believe this

Can you believe this, can you believe this
Can you believe this, can you believe this
