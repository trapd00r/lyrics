Melanie:
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of cities
Lonely as I am
Together we cry we cry we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
(Like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)
I don't ever wanna feel
(Like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)

Natalie:
I drive on his streets
'Cause he's my companion
I walk through his hills
'Cause he knows who I am
He sees my good deeds
And he kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
(Like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)
I don't ever wanna feel
(Like we're a crap band)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)

(One time two time three time four time)
Shaznay:
It's hard to believe
There's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have his love
The city he loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
(Like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)
I don't ever wanna feel
(Like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)
I don't ever wanna feel
(Like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)
I don't ever wanna feel
(Like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)
All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way
