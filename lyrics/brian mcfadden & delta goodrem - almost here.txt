Brian:

Did I hear you right?

Cause I thought you said

Let's think it over

You have been my life

And I never planned

Growing old without you



Shadows bleeding through the light

Where the love once shined so bright

Came without a reason

Don't let go on us tonight

Love's not always black and white

Haven't I always loved you?



Delta:

But when I need you

You're almost here

And I know that's not enough

And when I'm with you

I'm close to tears

'cause your only almost here



Brian:

I would change the world

If I had a chance

Oh won't you let me

Treat me like a child

Throw your arms around me

Oh please protect me



Brian & Delta:

Bruise and battered by your words

Days are shattered, how it hurts

Brian:

Oh, haven't I always loved you?



Delta:

But when I need you

You're almost here

And I know that's not enough

And when I'm with you

I'm close to tears

'cause your only almost here



Brian & Delta:

Bruise and battered by your words

Days are shattered, now it hurts

Brian:

Haven't I always loved you?



Delta:

But when I need you

You're almost here

Brian:

Well I never knew how far behind I'd left you

Delta:

And when I hold you

You're almost here

Brian:

Well I'm sorry that I took our love for granted



Brian & Delta:

And now I'm with you

I'm close to tears

Brian:

Cause I know I'm almost here



Brian & Delta:

Only almost here
