America
(Background: The white zone is for 
 loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking.)
We love you 
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours? 
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect. 
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
the United States Government has sworn to uphold 
Or so we are told 
(Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song) 

I never would have dreamed in a million years I'd see 
so many motherfuckin' people who feel like me 
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs 
Its like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me 
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed 
at no particular direction just sprays and sprays 
Straight through your radio waves it plays and plays 
Till it stays stuck in your head for days and days 
Who woulda thought standin' in this mirror bleachin' my hair 
wit some Peroxide reachin' for a T shirt to wear 
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this 
I must've struck a chord wit somebody up in the office 
'Cause Congress keeps tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems 
And now they sayin' I'm in trouble wit the government I'm lovin' it 
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on 

White America 
I could be one of your kids 
White America
little Eric looks just like this 
White America 
Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL 
Look how many hugs I get 

White America
I could be one of your kids 
White America
little Eric looks just like this 
White America
Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL 
Look how many hugs I get 

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself 
If they were brown Shady lose Shady sits on the shelf 
But Shady's cute Shady knew Shady's dimples would help 
Make ladies swoon baby (Ooh baby) Look at myself 
Lets do the math, if I was black I woulda sold half 
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that 
But I can rap so fuck school I'm too cool to go back 
Gimme the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at 
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white 
No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up, I was like 
Fuck it until I met Dre the only one who looked past 
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass 
Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got 
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got 
Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin' at shit, wow 
I'm like My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's

White America  
I could be one of your kids

Look how many hugs I get 

White America

I go to TRL 
Look how many hugs I get 

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids 
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist 
whose moms probably woulda never gave 2 squirts of piss 
Till I created so much mutherfuckin' turbulence 
Straight out the tube right into your livin' rooms I came 
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre 
That's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in 
And they connected wit me too because I looked like them 
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope 
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb its like this rope 
waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat 
Watchin' me while I write this like I don't like yes no 
All I hear is: Lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors workin' 
round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely 
hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston 
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom 
so now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin '
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say faggot 
Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the poster child 
The mutherfuckin' spokesman now for 

White America  
I could be one of your kids 
White America  
little Eric looks just like this 
White America  
Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL 
Look how many hugs I get

Look how many hugs I get 

So to the parents of America 
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica 
To attack her character of 
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress 
And piss on the lawns of the White House 
and to burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker 
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy 
Fuck you Ms Cheney! 
Fuck you Tipper Gore! 
Fuck you with the freedom of speech this divided state 
Of embarrassment will allow me to have, 
Fuck You ! 

Ha Ha Ha 
I'm just playin' America, you know I love you
