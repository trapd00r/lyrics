"I was born amidst the burbling waterfalls
I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world. Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning. A lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future, relived my past
And witnessed the beauty of the beast"

Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child

How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance, would I return?

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from the cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of Man
To drink it is to follow the left-hand path

Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time

"Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is it the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time
Soon to be freed from care, from human pain
My tale is the most bitter truth:
Time pays us but with earth and dust, and a dark, silent grave
Remember, my child: Without innocence, the cross is only iron
Hope is only an illusion, and Ocean Soul's nothing but a name
The Child bless thee and keep thee forever"
