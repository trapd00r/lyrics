One morning in June
Some twenty years ago
I was born a rich man's son
I had everything that money could buy,
But freedom I had none

I've been looking for freedom
I've been looking so long
I've been looking for freedom
Still the search goes on
I've been looking for freedom
Since I left my home town
I've been looking for freedom
Still it can't be found

I headed down the track
My baggage on my back
I left the city far behind
Walking down that road
With my heavy load
Trying to find some ease of mind

Father said: "You'll be sorry, son,
If you leave your home this way
And when you realize
The freedom money buys
You'll come running home someday"

I've been looking for freedom
I've been looking so long
I've been looking for freedom
Still the search goes on
I've been looking for freedom
Since I left my home town
I've been looking for freedom
Still it can't be found

I made a lot of dues
Had plenty to lose
Travelling across the land
Worked on a farm,
Got some muscle in my arms
But still I'm not a self-made man
I feel the run for many years to come
I'll be searching door to door
And given some time
Some day I'm gonna find
The freedom (freedom, freedom) I've been searching for

I've been looking for freedom
I've been looking so long
I've been looking for freedom
Still the search goes on
I've been looking for freedom
Since I left my home town
I've been looking for freedom
Still it can't be found

I've been looking for freedom
I've been looking so long
I've been looking for freedom
Still the search goes on
I've been looking for freedom
Since I left my home town
I've been looking for freedom
Still it can't be found
