(And all around the world)
(And all around the world)

(And all around the world) All around the world, same song 
(And all around the world) All all around the world same song  
Yo, we've been all around the world
(And all around the world) All around the world same song  
(And all around the world) All all around the world same song  

(same song ...)

[Shock G]
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song 
That I'm singing, dinga-linging
Funky beats ringin', everybody's swingin'
In the place as I kick the J A Z Z Y style
R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it wont be long
Till I'm gone - It's just the same old song 

[Humpty Hump] 
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile we keep the beat kickin
Sweat drippin, girlies in the limo eatin chicken 
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my jim hat (jim jat)
When I'm rappin, as if she's clappin, then I'm strappin', 'cause I'm smarter than that 
Then, girlie, maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song

All around the world, same song 
It's the same ol' song, y'all
All all around the world same song  
Uh, it's just the same ol' song
All around the world same song  
It's the same song
All all around the world same song  

[Money B]
Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky
up and down, well, as a matter of fact I'll be right back I gotta take a leaky
So I'm drainin' entertainin',
But I got fame and the bases I touch to much for me to try to be namin
Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned
I busted in and I was goin' to win
A Clark Gable back in Oakland, it's the same old song 
To sporty shorties, same freckles and hat
drinkin the same 40

[Humpty Hump]
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip 
Just like butter, my ryhmes are legit
Cause I'm the humpty. Not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump 
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump 

[Shock G]
Ah, shut up and just listen, not dissin', don't get me wrong 
But to me it's just the same old song 
So just watch, my name is Shock, I like to rock and you can't stop this 
2Pac go ahead, rock this

[2Pac & Humpty Hump]
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground 
Girls who used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around 
Gas me and when they pass me, they used to diss me
Harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high 
Same song can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
(Claim the fame must have changed, now that we became strong)
I remain still the same (why Tu'?), cause it's the same song

All around the world, same song 
The same ol' song, y'all
All all around the world same song  
And ya don't, ya don't, check it
All around the world same song - it's the same song
Ya don't stop - it's just the same song
All all around the world same song  
Hibbie dibbie ya don't quit
All around the world same song 
Ah yeah, Humpty Hump in the house y'all
All all around the world same song  
You know what - it's the same ol' song
All around the world same song 
All all around the world the same song  
Ahh...

(same song)

All around the world, same song ...
