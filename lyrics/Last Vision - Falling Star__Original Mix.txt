Life is like a big merry-go-round,
You're up and then down,
Going in circles trying to get to where you are.
Everybody's been counting you out,
But where are they now?
Sitting in the same old place,
Just faces in the crowd.
We all make mistakes,
You might fall on your face,
But you gotta get up!

[Chorus:]
I'd rather stand tall
Than live on my knees,
'Cause I am a conqueror,
And I won't accept defeat!
Try telling me no,
One thing about me
Is I am a conqueror,
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh

Got a vision that no one else sees,
Lot of dirty work, roll up your sleeves,
Remember there's a war out there,
So come prepared to fight!
You never know where the road leads you,
Not everyone's gonna believe you,
And even though they're wrong, don't prove them right.

[Chorus:]
I'd rather stand tall (tall)
Than live on my knees (can't live on my knees)
'Cause I am a conqueror
And I won't accept defeat!
Try telling me no (no)
One thing about me (one thing about me)
Is I am a conqueror,
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh (Ooh oh)
I am a conqueror!

We all make mistakes,
You might fall on your face,
But you gotta get up!
We all make mistakes,
You might fall on your face,
Don't ever give up!

[Chorus:]
I'd rather stand tall (oooh)
Than live on my knees (can't live on my knees)
'Cause I am a conqueror (I am a conqueror)
And I won't accept defeat! (And I won't accept defeat)
Try telling me no (try telling me no)
One thing about me (one thing about me)
Is I am a conqueror (is I am a conqueror)
I am a conqueror!
Ooh oh (Ooh oh)
I am a conqueror!

We all make mistakes,
You might fall on your face,
But I am a conqueror! (oh ooh)
