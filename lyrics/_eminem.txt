Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Yeah, too late
I can't keep, chasing you
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I don't think she understands, the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would have stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I would have laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain

Bitch you, took me for granted took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it, I'ma take control of this relationship command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now goddammit

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid

Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness

And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase, it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth

I told you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah funny ain't it
You neglected me, did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you, in my heart I have kept, it's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side (yeah)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life (can't take no more, can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I feel like when I bend over  (too late) backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you
Still man I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcin' you, go marry someone else and make 'em famous

And take away their freedom, like you did to me, treat 'em
Like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you, feed 'em
The same shit that you made me eat, I'm movin' on forget you
Oh, now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you

All I ever felt was dissed, helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me, why I can't just walk away from 'em
I'm addicted to the pain the stress the drama, I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed

But this time I ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch

And it's just
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life (I'm gone man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life[Hook: 50 Cent]

Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now, homie, I say I "run it run it" because I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feelin' a'ight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin', shawty says she comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it, okay, now maybe I'm sidick
'Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidick
You should see when I'm stuntin', I flash the stones to be wantin'
Push the whip, see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know the Unit's the game
I got my grimy Shady with me, you front, you'll have to get me
Off yo' ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh (haha)
It's not a big deal, it's nothin' but some cash

This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

[Hook: 50 Cent + Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? I said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K.
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam
Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens
Mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream
Developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea
Can't tell I'm a fuckin' G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered
I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits
You dig it? See…

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know

This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo(Intro - Eminem)

[Beatboxing] Yeah, we should do something like that...

(Chorus - 50 Cent)

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!

(Verse 1 - Eminem)

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex [reversed], a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass

(Verse 2 - 50 Cent)

Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, to clean parts, to shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tell you're ass apart!
A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows
You rocking wit the kid to spit sicker sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down
I smile through summan' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

(Hook - 50 Cent (Eminem))

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head, funky funk up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, (It's the Re-Up!)
Shady, Shady...[Intro - Eminem]
Remix [echoes]
Lloyd Banks! [echoes]
Ha ha! [echoes]

[Verse 1 - Eminem]
It's like a throne that he dont even own
He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport
Runnin circles with the competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it
And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it
You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It
Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise
It aint healthy To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid
Hit Your Corner With my weapon I Dont Need My Boyz
Im Doin 120 On The Fast Lane
Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang
Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain
Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate
And he hops in a 100 thousands with a Nigga's gate
House with just a bigger gate , houndin him's a big mistake
He wont surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break
Cuz he remember when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand
So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name
When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them
G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It

It aint healthy To Be Makin Niggaz Paranoid

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent]
He's no magician man they can't made somethin outta nothin
So now niggaz from his hood act like we owe em somethin
They talk crazy til we send this nigga in there to buck em
Ask 'em if theres a problem and they'll say naw its nothin
He's been tryin to help em out, but since they fronted, fuck em
He dont care how they feel they can hate em or love em
He hold it down on his own the kid is really thuggin
He's rich now, he aint change since these Niggaz think he buggin'
He bullet proof everything Niggaz try to buck him
Keep 2 pistols on ya hip I show you we aint tuck em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they cant touch him
Try to catch em slippin, they creepin and he start bustin

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It

[Nate Dogg]
I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn your smile upside down
You ain't no G, you a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl until I turn her out
Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckin' somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouthSometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics

And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like

Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eye balls, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's

Just been stripped, I've just been ripped
So I must then get what the bus didn't split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back

(8 Mile Road)
And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant in the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP

And get a new plan, mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand

While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin' I never wanted so bad

Sometimes I get upset, 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grown me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best

And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon-holed in no regular job

Yo, I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far

But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back

(8 Mile Road)
And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate

Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible, up on the same pedestal as me

But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go

Who must I show to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
'Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it

Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit

And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm old, stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up and one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, the city is no fun

There is no sun and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin

Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got

But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin on next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature

I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured

Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back

(8 Mile Road)
And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gonna follow no footsteps, I'm makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road(Feat. B-Real, Eminem)

(Intro: Eminem)
WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO! (laughs)
Guess who's back?!?!
Mommy! We're home!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!

(Verse: Eminem)
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was
50, Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is 'bout it, 'bout it
The noise from (?) be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off

(Chorus: Eminem)
Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the K's get to scream
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911

(Verse: B-Real)
Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches till there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

(Verse: Ganxsta Ridd)
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these - imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
'Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'sJust the two of us (Baby your dada loves you) (Hey)
Just the two of us
Just the two of us (And I'mma always be here for you) (Hey)
Just the two of us (No matter what happens)

Just the two of us (You're all I got in this world) 
Just the two of us (I would never give you up for nothin'
Just the two of us (Nobody in this world)
Just the two of us (Is ever gonna keep you from me, I love you)

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (Whew), dada must've runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you want to help dada build a sand castle? (Yeah)
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

See honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And dada's probably on his way to all of them except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (Wah)
I told you it's okay Hai Hai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

Wake up, sweepy head, we're here
Before we pway, we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (Mama?)
That's why you can't get her to wake
But don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (Mommy?)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

Just the two of us (Just me and you baby)
Just the two of us (Is all we need in this world)
Just the two of us (Just me and you)
Just the two of us

Your dada will always be there for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me I'mma always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you babyJust the two of us (Baby your dada loves you) (Hey)
Just the two of us
Just the two of us (And I'mma always be here for you) (Hey)
Just the two of us (No matter what happens)

Just the two of us (You're all I got in this world) 
Just the two of us (I would never give you up for nothin'
Just the two of us (Nobody in this world)
Just the two of us (Is ever gonna keep you from me, I love you)

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (Whew), dada must've runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you want to help dada build a sand castle? (Yeah)
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

See honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And dada's probably on his way to all of them except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (Wah)
I told you it's okay Hai Hai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (And when we ride)
Just the two of us, just the two of us (Just you and I)

5'9!  I'm the King!
What...yeah...what, yo...

[CHORUS]
I'm-a rhyme til I can't rhyme no more
Burn til I can't burn no more
Shine til there's no shine no more
Til the earth can't turn no more
Until I'm 5'9 no nore (I'm the king!) [2x]

Ya'll niggaz is real cocky on the street
Til I drop you on ya knees
Knock you on ya feet, I'm like Rocky on the reach
I rain while you hope to sustain dope in this game
Somethin' you can't stop, you can only hope to contain
I can aim so I blaze my tool
I got a name from usin' pocket change to pay my dues (niggaz know!)
I'm sharp as a shank and about as soft as you think
I'm hangin from the cross of your link, you get offered a drink
Niggaz is fast learners, you're only as hot as the back burner
From mad rappers and clap burners
Talk to the foot thinkin' you real
I'm starin' at the face of ya bill forgettin' how George Washington looks
You came to box a nigga that's flat out dirty
Just name the spot and I'll be there a half hour early
I write for the purpose to express a view
A nigga that's wack?  You a nigga that I don't like as a person

[CHORUS 2x]

I'm in shape to give you a quick whoopin', hard asshole in the wall
Frownin' up, niggaz thinkin' you sick cuz you sick lookin'
I'm heated, an' I'm-a go to trial blowin' my triggers
Ya'll niggaz ain't rough, you need to smile more in ya pictures
Split somebody, and serve the nigga whose style you bit
That bit like 10 niggaz that bit somebody
Top of the world, all that's around you is beneath me
Me learnin' from your mistakes is the only way you can teach me
Mo' thunder, cockin' big heat
So undergrounds niggaz wit' beef can get mo' under, 6 feet
Man ya missles, I plan to dis you
Unleash wit' about 30 punches before the first lands and hits you
Niggaz I doubt ya'll cuz I'm an outlaw
Right-handed, built wit' a left that can arm wrestle a southpaw
Gun shine bright, (ya'll niggaz?) ya'll need to rhyme like 5'9
Unsigned wit' hype... (King!)

[CHORUS 2x]

I'm the kiiiiiiiing....on the microphone
I'm the kiiiiiiiing....no, no I ain't jokin'
I'm the kiiiiiiiing....that's in command, that's in command
I'm the kiiiiiiiing....on the microphone
I'm the kiiiiiiiing....the funk rhymin' master
I'm the kiiiiiiiing....that's in command, that's in command

Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check to smell it
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin' these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick till you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick till you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, I don't feel it

Chorus: Eminem

Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

(Eminem)
I'm ice grillin you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin' Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
On if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

Chorus: Eminem

Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy -- listen!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy -- you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

(Eminem)
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls till I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes usin' dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin' somethin' somethin', somethin' I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn![Eminem]

Damn!The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing doing doing 

I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true 
I ain't never seen an ass like that 
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go 
D-doing doing doing

The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'm gon' answer
Police saying, "Freeze!", d-doing doing doing

What do you mean "freeze"?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees 

I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes I make R&B
I sing song it go, "ring-e-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching"

Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend I'm sorry, please please forgive
For I am Triumph the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

Jessica Simpson looks oh so temptin'

Now they're getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying, "Freeze!", d-doing doing doing

What do you mean "freeze", geez, I just got my seat?
I have ticket look, I put away my zipper-zip
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate's shower scene

I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free

Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh, 'cause there's a puppet on my hand
(Ha, ha, ha)

The way you shake it, I can't believe it

The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing 

The way she moves she dances like a go-go
In that video she sings get out your poles, so
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
Police saying, "Freeze!", d-doing doing doing

What do you mean "freeze", my computers would be seized?
And my keys to my ranch, I just baked cookies
Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this

Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee-pee, pee
On the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast, I think I just saw a tit?

Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing doing doing

So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please?

I dont know why this world keeps turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now

Yes man
As the World Turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and Tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience

(Eminem)
I hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool, takin a shit in a warm pool
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who Me?)
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin (RARRRR!)
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

Chorus

As the World Turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day

(Eminem)
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up, its nice to meet ya"
I'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin funny
Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to out run me
I went to grab my gun
Thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran through Alleys, parkin lots and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fuckin porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
You might as well come out now
She said "Come in, its unlocked!"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn
She said "Come here big boy, lets get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
(Mimicks theme from Inspector Gadget) Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ahh!! Ahhh!)
Come here bitch!
Come here!
Take this motherfuckin dick!
Bitch, come here!

Chorus to fade

And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
Every day
Every single day the world keeps turning
keeps turningPolice voice:
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

Verse 1:
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks

Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

Verse 2:
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

Verse 3:
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"

Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

Verse 4:
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place' went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

Verse 5:
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Police voice:
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then

{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just let it goooooo!}

(Eminem)
Hand me an ,8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here} and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
I'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {Ahh!}
Human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not {yup}
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No shit I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?

(Chorus Two)
{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just let it gooo!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just do it!}

(Eminem)
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!

(Chorus Three)
{Just let it gooo!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just do it!}

(Eminem)
My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

(Chorus Two)**(Cowboy)**
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop em
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine

(Eminem)
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (AAHHH)

Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said

(Royce)
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets

Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot

One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations collaborating
Attemptin to take over the earth

(Eminem)
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)

We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle

Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vain

(Royce)
The disaster wit dreds
I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money

I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you

Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws
Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
And bust till volcanoes errupt

*phone rings*
Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get you)
STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US!!

(Eminem)
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah)
I'm the one who burned your house down (oh)
Well I'm out now (shit)
And this time I'm comin back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of

Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

'Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel

(We'll be waitin) See you in hell
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (till next time)

(Cowboy)
And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh...(spits) wait, did y'all hear that?
(Footsteps and windblowing)Oh, it's music to my ears
Oh, man!
How can I describe, the way I feel?
Fuckin' great man
Ok, let me see, how can I begin?

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was bread wine, more bread wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch

Mariah whatever happened to us
Why did we have to break up, all I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much, I can't imagine what's
Going through your mind after such

A nasty break up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck
Up, I'm not playin' I want her back, ya punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk

Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that ya want

I mean I really want ya bad, ya cunt
Nick you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag

You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster, my signature
Sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant wow

Man, what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-
ceuticals this beautiful pill dust in my palm my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama

I’ll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fucking annoyin' drop the shovel boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doing

I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon ya prick I wish ya luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on Malachi
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn

Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucking on
Man what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're running over the snow blower with the lawn mower
Blow on your bagpipes from Baghdad 

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag

In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty fuckin' you till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles

Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends? You need a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first we'll do a coin flip

I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other especially when your joined at the hip

I'm going to get a needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch them back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate Chips Ahoy chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid flick

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease? For Pete sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind, half the time when I rhyme while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag of bagpipes from Baghdad

What's cracking, Dre? 

Dr. Dre
Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, start riots like Limp Bizkit (Limp Bizkit)
Throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts
And watch mosh pits till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(That's right, nigga)

Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds, me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central (Whoa)

Not these niggas again, these grown ass ignorant men
With hand triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach
(Snoop, Eastside)

We came a long way to making these songs play
It a be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uzi, and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre
But I

Snoop
Somehow, someway, hello, nigga
You know about Doggy, Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from

Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about 50 guns, and I love all of 'em the same
Bang bang
Damn, baby girl, what's yo name?

I forgot, what'd you say it was?
Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club wit my nephew, Eminem

Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Xzibit
I'm the head nigga in charge
I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage
With 10 o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, 'cause I expose the fasciad
Your little lungs is too small to hot box with God

All jokes aside, come bounce wit us
Standing over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a body bag, but never in cuffs

So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shooting with Puff
Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop

Ah no, Big Slim Dogg, 80 pound balls (What?)
Dick six inch long (Huh?)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy)

Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right?
I'm just a criminal making a livin' off the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right?

To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night and screamin' at mom's schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me

I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down is a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude is being this mean

So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard tea CD using the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot
You happy now? Look here

I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit, they throw me out the back do'
Come back and shoot the club up wit a fo-four

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Nate Dogg
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Snoop
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Xzibit
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah*Girl talking on phone*
Justin, its Zoe, Um Kellie did not have me call you
However I just listened to Eminem in her car
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard
In my entire life and I seriously want to call his
Fucking agent and tell them how fucking disgusting
He is, it like makes me upset, I am now nauseous and
I cant eat lunch, goodbye[DJ scratching] - "Do it!"

(Eminem)

Sneakin in through the back door, fruity MC's get ambushed
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two
Smackin through till you're black and blue for actin' true
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans
I'm stompin, I'm kickin, I'm chokin, I'm stampin em
Clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts
Hit 'em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
I'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers
Faster than you could snap your fingers for ransom
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin
Survivin by connivin and theivin

[DJ scratching] - "Do it!", "Eat 'em up"


(Eminem)

I had a dream I was gettin' jacked by biters
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders
Developin a fear of biterphobia
I'm holdin' a gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies
And I'ma torture, with material iller
Than a stark ravin mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airborne assault of the rappers
Hit the source to better my skills,
I head for the border
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream till my voice is hoarse
'Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like Labradors
In the range of my double-barrel
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril

(DJ scratching)


(Eminem)

I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires
'Cause vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers
And swing on my big thingamajig
So I'm bringin' my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig
Cause biters are fallin' head over heels
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with
An ultimatum I assault and slayed em
With rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em
Energetic and imaginative,
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen

[DJ scratching] - "Everybody walk out the back door"

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now, homie, I say I "run it run it" because I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feelin' a'ight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin', shawty says she comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it, okay, now maybe I'm sidick
'Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidick
You should see when I'm stuntin', I flash the stones to be wantin'
Push the whip, see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know the Unit's the game
I got my grimy Shady with me, you front, you'll have to get me
Off yo' ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh (haha)
It's not a big deal, it's nothin' but some cash

I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

[Hook: 50 Cent + Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? I said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K.
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam
Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens
Mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream
Developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea
Can't tell I'm a fuckin' G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered
I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits
You dig it? See…

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony YayoScalpel

Sponge
(Here)
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
(Ah)
We're gonna have to shock him (Oh my, oh my God)
We're gonna have to shock him (Oh my God)

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts, (Nurse we're losin' him, check the pulse)
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch it was 1:20
(I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?)
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache it works"
I screamed, "Ow, my appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse"
(What's the matter?) I don't know, my leg, it hurts"
(Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy?)
Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
(Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework)
But don't you wanna give me after school detention?
(Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him)

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey"
The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)
And started helpin' him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
"This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back bully, now once and for good"
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it till I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryna to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs?
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug" (Sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?"
(Oh my God, I'm sorry son) Shut up you cunt
I said, "Fuck it," took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

It's brain damage
I got brain damage
It's brain damage
It's probably brain damage
It's brain damage
Brain damage
I got brain damage
It's brain damageYo
Check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budgin'

I'm with-holding my anger
Though id like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's punie neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's when he says to himself as he
Uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that hes manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
And he don't exist in his world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And its destroying him slowly
'Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now hes acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so hes mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

You ain't no muthafuckin
Buuully
And I ain't bowing to no muthafuckin
Buuully
I won't allow it, ain't no coward to no
Buuully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a
Buuully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a
Buuully

And I know it must be fuckin' with you emotionally

Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other muthafuckas that just are
They just keep houndin at me
Now that I'm down wit 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at Bay
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough
And Murder INC's the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff
And blow our label down
But our buildings made out of bricks
So you ain't takin' our shit
And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card
And it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus that stylist that you fucked
When you was extacy'd up
Was just a man who's dressed up
As a white bitch

You must be takin' too much eeeeeeeeee

Now what bothers me the most
About hip hop is we so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master Jay
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs, Snake Tongue and Freaky Tah
It's like a neverending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybodies gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excluding myself
'Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men we learn
To let shit go but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to up hold
When someone steps on our toe
Its no exception it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
And wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
They just keep feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg I'm talkin' to you straight
If the situation escalates and worse
Were gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailey's name

Irv go get your boy up off that Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Get at me dawg, holla[Missy]

[Eminem]
Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches
Hit a fuckin [*pregnant chick*] in her [*stomach*] with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
Lookin for some other thug, to beat the crap out
I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speakin so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
[Shady] Yeah
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim motherfuckin Shady
[Shady] Yeah
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
[Shady] Yeah
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy ..

[Eminem]
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (one more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (SHUT UP!)
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil (bitch)
And waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin
You motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nuttin

[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
[Shady] What's the deal?
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim motherfuckin Shady
[Shady] Yeah.. who?
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
[Shady] What's the deal?
[Missy] Won't you busa rhyme for me boy ..

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want what you got is it hot? (Is it hot?)

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily

Slim Shady.. Misdemeanor..
Timbaland.. Slim Shady..
Misdemeanor..

I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends
Holdin a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin tecs at you until you see your fuckin legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin next to you
(AHH!) Fuckin mad dog, foamin at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (KEEP FILMING!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

[Missy]
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy!!! Get back
Uhh, I'ma put you all in the line
Uhh, and I'ma watch you MC's die
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind!
I think somebody done pissed her off this time!
Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and
Uhh, you will have to clean up the mess (uh-huh)
It's rainin rainin and it's pourin loud
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uhh, I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me damnit? Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile (uh-huh)
Lay em on down, like they lived underground (uh)
For the sound, that me and, Timbaland, we found
Get your ass, kicked later, or get your ass, kicked now

(Eminem)
Your 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old doc is back

Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges

Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrrm, vrrm, yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-11, so

Let's get down to business

Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

Quick; gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers, Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone. Time to get rid of these rap criminals

So skip to your lou, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more; you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit

The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exagerate it all so much 
They make it all up; there's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans

It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin', and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and André's carnival. C'mon now!

Let's get down to business

(Eminem)
It's just like old times: the dynamic duo 
Two old friends; why panic? You already know
Who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0

You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat 
People stepping over people just to rush to the set

Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?

Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone; the game needs me

Till we grow beards, get weird, and disappear 
Into the mountains; nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around 'round here 
Yo, Dre! (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down

Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Quick; gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers, Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone. Time to get rid of these rap criminals

So skip to your lou, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more; you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit

The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exagerate it all so much 
They make it all up; there's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans

It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin', and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and André's carnival. C'mon now!

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?

(Eminem)
It's just like old times: the dynamic duo 
Two old friends; why panic? You already know
Who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0

You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat 
People stepping over people just to rush to the set

Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?

Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone; the game needs me

Till we grow beards, get weird, and disappear 
Into the mountains; nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around 'round here 
Yo, Dre! (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?

Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old doc is back

Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges

Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrrm, vrrm, yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-11, so

(Eminem)
Oh, hah(Little girl)
I, I wanna grow up toon
Poppa Marshall, will you tell us a bed time story?

(Eminem)
Heeere we gooo
Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went letter double pop a wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head

"Me and you clef we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"

Hey mister, would ya care ta bear witness ta
The ass-whippin I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blista
Stan-abis, little Marshall Mathers sista
Annanis, corner, we have a mister
Not havin' it it's the machinista
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonist bag of dick-suckin
Ex LL Cool Jay fan from Windsor
I'm bout to murder little guinea fag Anista
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at I miss ya

Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch where for art thou can-a-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with that style that you were rappin' with?
Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor from Canada? Oh Can-a-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in a bat man chair an relaxin
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanner
It's 'Can-a-bitch' or some Stan lives shit
They creep me out at first man this is sick
But me being just a sick as conflict gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were
Tellin' me shit like you respect me like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask
How come I ain't return none of the messages at Shady Records you left me?
The fourth Letter "Slim you really startin to upset me"
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building
This crazy mother fucker's really tryin' to kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters
That said some shit about a message you left
Oh shit that's not an "e" that's an "a"
This dude wants to leave me a massage he's gay
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
We got a bogey "Marshall I'm on the way"

Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch where for art thou can-a-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with that style that you were rappin' with?
Can-a-bitch oh can-a-bitch are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor from Canada? Oh Can-a-bitch

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib
Only thing is we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
Shit oh Dre wait a mintue that's it
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
We can fly over the border "Let's go whoosh"
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin speed
*Pfftt Arghh* What was that? Oh Jermaine Dupre fuck It
Keep goin' no time to waste
Wait backup hit him one more time in case (Okay)
Fuck now he's draggin under the car
Oh well only 30 more thousand miles
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hatin'
And tryin' to figure out what happened to Jermaine propaine
"He couldn't have fell of that hard" ain't no way

"What happened to the way you was rappin',
When you was scandalous then Canabis turned into a television evangelist?"

Plus he raps with his regular voice
*Pft, pft, pft, pft* "What was that?" (Pet Shop Boys)
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
He kind of smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork he's done
So I stapped him twice kept jabbin Christ
He won't die this guy's like a battered wife
He's like Kim he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw
Hold up Bis quit foldin up
Punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch
Do somethin' at least one punch line
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-tey-nine percent of my fans are blonde
Bis c'mon answer me man respond
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars
Intergalatic or metaphors from Mars
Raw to the floor raw like Resovoir dogs
Bite another line from Red Man's song
Suddenly the stub of a dead man's arm from a midget
Reaches out from under the car
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither
Dre starts sprayin him with cans of Ether *Sshhhh*
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again
(Compton) Detroit Bitch talk some shit again
Stomp him (switch feet)
Stomp him (switch again)
Dre all right he's dead dawg quit kickin him
I think Stan-abis jumped off the bridge again (Arghhhhhh... Damn!)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again(Numerous news reports)
"Breaking news, Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour
To check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction
To sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops."
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently
Survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be
A random drive-by shooting. Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be...
Alienated... on again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire
At an after-hours club we've learned that the rapper Proof
Has been fatally shot."
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem, and a member of the rap group D12."
"D12 back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation
Continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break
But doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask,
'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"

So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
There's somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster, I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert, I was rakin in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losin my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it, every CD critics gave it a 3
Then three, years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called "The Slim Shady LP" the greatest
"The Marshall Mathers" was a classic, "The Eminem Show" was fantastic
But "Encore" just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be "Illmatic"
And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin' pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld

I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been prayin' for me
Every day and for some reason it's been weighin on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But somethin' told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least, a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin it from a opposite standpoint, man boy it's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now on how, to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllldYou are now listening to the sounds of...Shady and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist...

Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags,
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,
Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser,
Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when i ask her,
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh,
While we hover over Nebraska,
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,
In the helicopter, man i can't fuck her no faster,
She's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,
But i ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after,
I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper,
Everyday man i just seem to get a little bit doper, 

Shit, Back down, 
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum, 
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,
While i watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah, 
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,
Getting home and play dick swords with the Jonas...Brothers,
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other,
I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...

Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam,
I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama,
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama,
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas,Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closetGood mornin
Haha, wake your mother fuckin' asses up
Hey yo what is the what?
Well come on in, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin' on my group, bitch

For whatever it's worth, it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever get ass squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be brauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad, they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap Then it's a wrap, Then it's a scrap
An it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a bit, boy, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me 'cause they just bounce off me like bullets do, 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally (argghhh!)
I do this for Swifty
Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy, and Proof are you with me?

(Chorus: Eminem)
Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

(Swifty)
They said of me, the epitome of a beef starter
In a party with heat. It's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs. they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses, A halocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dark shit, I'ma gothic death prophet. yo stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin frequent
You n***az need a 'E' just to speak shit
An Your leader is a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it an won't even keep it a secret
N***a I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

(Chorus: Eminem)
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your ass up, mother fuckers. Quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

(Kuniva)
Yo yo
I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
"What tha fuck" did he say in his rap Em?
I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, is my family a couple (???)
Am I (?????)? To emtpy out them (???)
To fight you in front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get points across when I write
Just emotion's enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT?!"
I might as well give this up
But tha'd be selfish as fuck to leave D12 an' it's What?
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life


(Kon Artis)
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin' off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fifth
Your carcas'll split even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause n***az'll test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
Or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred n***az from (???)
So get to gunnin if you comin'

(Chorus: Eminem)
Well Come on in Everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
'Cause we get it on un- till the break of dawnin'
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
'Cause we ain't leavin' till 6 in tha mornin
So help us sing along with the words o' the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on inYeah...
It's my life...
In my own words I guess...

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. "Daddy, you're lying.
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine."
She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
"Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you."
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying, "You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding."
But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'.
"You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad.
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin.
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going."
But, baby, wait.
"It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
And burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her,
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

[*curtains closing and sounds of clapping*]Uh nmm
This thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Uhh

Guess whos back?
Back again
Ken is back
Tell some men

Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back
Rub my back, ooh

Wait
Hello?
Uh, goodbyeStill on? 
Yo, is the mic on? 
Check, check, check 
Alright, let's do it 
Let's go, come on 
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem)(Dr. Dre)
Marshall, sounds like an S.O.S.

(Eminem)
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics André, you're fucking right!

(Dr. Dre)
To the rap mobile, let's go! 

(Lady)
Marshall!
Marshall!

(Eminem)
Bitches and gentlemen
It's showtime
Hurry, hurry step right up
Introducing the star of our show; his name is…

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without futher ado, I bring to you…

(Lady)
Marshall! 

(Eminem)
Your 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old doc is back

Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges

Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrrm, vrrm, yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-11, so

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Quick; gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers, Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone. Time to get rid of these rap criminals

So skip to your lou, while I do what I do best 
You ain't even impressed no more; you used to it 
Flows too wet, nobody close to it 
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit

The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exagerate it all so much 
They make it all up; there's no such thing 
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans

It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin', and you know what for 
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and André's carnival. C'mon now!

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)

I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
It's just like old times: the dynamic duo 
Two old friends; why panic? You already know
Who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0

You can even call collect, the most feared duet 
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink or get to busting a sweat 
People stepping over people just to rush to the set

Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?

Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone; the game needs me

Till we grow beards, get weird, and disappear 
Into the mountains; nothing but clowns down here
But we ain't fucking around 'round here 
Yo, Dre! (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
Let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around. What is this?
Must be a circus in town; let's shut that shit down
On these clowns. Can I get a witness?

(Dr. Dre)
(Hell yeah!)

(Eminem)
So there you have it folks 

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend André
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
And André are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray

(Lady)
Marshall!

(Eminem)
So until next time friends 
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone; thank you for coming
Your host for the evening

(Lady)

(Eminem)

(Big) Yeah... yeah...
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah...
(Puff) Yeah... B.I.G. 2000
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again... c'mon...

Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong

(Notorious B.I.G.)
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace... smack the bitch in the face;
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)

Chorus 2X + "I don't care what nobody say" sample (4X at start)

(Notorious B.I.G.)
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push... me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

Chorus 2X + "I don't care what nobody say" sample (4X at start)

(Puff) Ladies and gentlemen...

(Eminem)
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, canibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a 'nan in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz's, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just din' have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third;
And she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong

Chorus 2X + "I don't care what nobody say" sample (4X at start)

Chorus repeats to fade...

(Puff Daddy)

(Puff Daddy)
Uh-huh, and we won't stop, because we can't stop[Intro: Male Medic]
DMC, we have a mid-30's male found down, unresponsive. Possible overdose, substance unknown.
Pulse is 60 and thready. Respiration's 8. He's intubated, and we're bagging him now.
Uhh, BP: 90 over palp. Patient is cool, pale, and diuretic.
Has aspirated. Uhh, GSC is 3. We'll update en route.
ETA: ten minutes.

As I, fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate

Start off with the NyQuil like "I think I'll just have a taste"
Couple of sips of that, then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, "Yeah, that's great."
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight

Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face "Mommy something is wrong with dad I think

He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat"

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew "What's a beer?"
That's the Devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fucking hear
"Marshall come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"

And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine

Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall, aim for the couch I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out, 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all

Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?
Man, fuck am I hungover and goddamn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by"

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know
That's a lie, 'cause I don't and why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die

Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helping you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self-inducing a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?

Now here I am three months later, full blown relapse
"Just get high until the kids get home from school, Holmes. Relax"
And since I'm, convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's, sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he

Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia, thing
It was bologna was it the methadone, ya think

Or the hydrocordone, you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with you Amb!en CR, great paces to hide 'em ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie,
"I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina"

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor
Damn

Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do

I'm at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That's what I call a Roethlisberger
You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops or syrups
Probably should have never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should have been one of the first signs to cause to learn
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I can't be apart from her
Cause nobodies body's awesomer - I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I'm popular, but

You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
(What is it then?) It's desperation

She's lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It's desperation)
I can't even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her
And here I go again

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you till I went to the lengths I did to meet you
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don't see nothin' but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can't do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can't, specifically to describe it I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout "I live and breathe you"
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek, cause this ain't...

You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
(What is it then?) It's desperation

Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think
You need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? (what) Delicia
I'm just mad it took the time it took me to discover
You been using me for loot like I used you for looks
Thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack, but I can't stomach this
I'm leavin' you, not comin' back. She said "The fuck with that
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin' bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal, through the uprights

You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
(What is it then?) It's desperationspoken:
Nah. Fuck an intro man, let's just go

I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe
Last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch? Get fucked
With the volume knob. Fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box
Of condoms, is that all you brought?
And you want a ménage à trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club
'To a bar room brawl. Get rowdy as
Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck in a vacuum, ya'll ain't
Nuttin', but a whole lot of suckin' goin' on
In rap. Yeah, but I'm home
Bad to the bone, back in the zone. Let him
Alone, you don't wanna go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you own
Crown so tight that it cuts off
Circulation to the brain: no oxygen
Other words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop
Hitchcock get her shit bitch ass, Doc got it
Ziplocked in a bag. You fags ain't been able
To fade me since Kid Rock had a high-top
Keep bloggin' while I'm mind bogglin'
'N I zone like I'm in the twilight. Dog, get
Off my bone, this is my mic, doggone
'N I like hoggin' it! Flow so
Wet, I'ma take this beat tobogganin'
I'm waterloggin' it
I'm soggin' it. Pull your verse out
The beat and stomp on it. Suplexin' it
On cement, like I'm on some straight outta
Compton shit. Take this dick and
Chomp on it. I'm so bad I can bitch
Slap a backhanded compliment
Jackass, eat a donkey dick
The game, I just about conquered it
Like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers bitch
I'm the king of this honky shit. I reign
Supreme in this honky shit. No sense
Screamin' and arguing. Makes no
Difference whether a Benz or Bentley
Or a Beamer's the car you in

You think you ball? Well, I palm it. I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelet
But you got egg on your face. Now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze. Bitch, I'm as bat shit
As Ozzy, it's obvious. You can tell right off the "bat"
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryina give me the finger's kinda like givin' a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it, and try to use it to my advantage
I catch a fly in that bitch. You think you fly? You're just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do, or make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual. And you can get ripped; she can open a can, too
But you better hope you can handle the heat, or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock-block, like a square fuckin' male chicken
Yeah. It's Shady, slut, the rest can suck on that big one
'Cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'

spoken:
Haha, RecoveryDetroit!

[Dej Loaf:]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Royce Da 5'9":]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall sea shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The Twin Eagles ol' air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance
My pair ol' shoot like sky divin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblinп rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ridin' around this block
All we knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?

[Big Sean:]
Shawn Don
(Welcome to Detroit)
Boy I need no half's a half, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where is you get that promotion
Don't worry, man those bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpiring
Boy hit the beat & just treat that shit like it's a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I've never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in a vet
Ha plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boys, is all that I fetch
If the the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm over respected, my mama gated community's over protective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' all listening to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like 50 days away
Tryin' to get paid 50 ways a day
Used to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a life time a few times
From futons to Grey Poupon's
In church tryin' to get a little savings, yeah coupon
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Naw it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

[Dej Loaf:]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Danny Brown:]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killas pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo ass not remembering
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Had K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Ketteran
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Ghan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

[Eminem:]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refilla a
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC'D the shit
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy?
For me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if
I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' it's fever pitch
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with a two penises
Hateful and genius ness, inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling
May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with ya but ain't shit changin'
And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here?
And if they mention us

[Dej Loaf:]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Trick Trick:]
What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody! Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'.

Detroit!
Okay! [echo][Eminem]

And watchin' ma momma tears, got me heated

Balled in the dirt from shots flurried
Layin' wit' bombs all on my shirt
I got plans to hop up in da Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder
When dem angels gon' call my number
Under
My chest is a heart of a lion, lion, lion
Pound me, honeys got me flyin'
Wit' my iron
Eyes are giant
I'm runnin' from nothin'
My stomach is touchin'
While I'm clutchin'
To give you more than a concussion
End the discussion

And to see a solder
Hurt on my shoulder
Look in the mirror

This is me who's gotta be
What you see on TV

Man, these teeny-boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies, in these rags
Live in fantasies, frontin'

Till the shoot-'em-up, bang
And you see your brains hang,
And you see we ain't playin',
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night 'n' ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game
And I'm done playin', man
I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin'
I'ma start, layin' any of dese, mothafuckin' cocksuckas
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward,

How would I look as a man, bowin' to his knees,
Like the mad cow disease
Let somebody lash out at me,
And not lash back out at 'em
Please,
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall?

One, two, three, and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
('Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'mma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man and at the same time burning her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
(Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom)

Dr. Dre:
Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
(So just chill till the next episode)

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
Falling back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N-double O-P
D-O-double G-Y, D-O-double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So Dre (What up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, city of Compton

Dr. Dre:
Is where it takes place so when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Like this, that, this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
(So just chill till the next episode)Eminem 
Obie, yo? 

Obie Trice
I'm sick 

Eminem
Damn, you straight dog?

Obie Trice
Bitches
Getting sick

Eminem 
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks be getting drips

Falling victim's to this shit 
From these bitches on our dicks 
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time 

Obie Trice
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk 
I had a bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk 
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners 
Fucked me good, you should've seen us 

Big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french role styling
Body like a stallion 
Sizing up the figure while my shit getting bigger 
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be a nigga? 

Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story

For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my john
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop

Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
The cannon, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon

And work that nigga like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between her hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
 
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though 
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks 
Me in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next

Like, what the fuck is going on here? This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated 'cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I ain't really got that shit
Fuck

Eminem
That's why I ain't got no time 
For these games and stupid tricks 
Or these bitches on my dick 
That's how dudes be getting sick 
That's how dicks be getting drips
 
Falling victim's to this shit 
From these bitches on our dicks 
Fucking chickens with no ribs 
That's why I ain't got no time 

Now I don't wanna hit no women but this chick's got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
 
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shoving me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore

What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you find it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips

When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickened in worse 
'Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hurse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick

So you go to the clinic, sweating every minute you're in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the Menace *laughs*
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it

So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see her, you're gon' bend her fucking neck back yo
'Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?

Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaners
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceiving, shit this ho's a genius she g'd us

That's why I ain't got no time 
For these games and stupid tricks 
Or these bitches on my dick 
That's how dudes be getting sick 
That's how dicks be getting drips

Falling victim's to this shit 
From these bitches on our dicks 
Fucking chickens with no ribs 
That's why I ain't got no time 

I'm busy! 

Obie Trice
Yeah, fuck these bitches 

Eminem 
Fuck 'em all 

Obie Trice
Get money 

Eminem 
Ha!

Oh my God, fucking Bomboclat

Tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,

And Bon Voyage bitch, I'm like Chef Boyar-
-dee in this bitch; send a bomb to my moms lawyer
Im a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
Til I pull you out the fucking story book and stomp on ya,
Fucking fictitional characters and fariytales,
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
But it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants parasail
Or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
And I aint wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
Lookin forward to fucking ya mada 

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on em,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,

Drop the bomb on em

See aint no reason to set the dogs on me,

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the real McCoy,

Here come the kill joys,
Me and Dre steel alloys,
The rap crown royals,
Scout cowboys
Now how that sound for ya,
Yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
So kick your shoes off,
Before you have a sound voyage,

And siyanara see ya fuckers tommorow,
Get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
And have a coke and a smile, dont make me open a jar,
Whip ass on ya, thats the last straw your hoping to draw,
Yeah you fresher than most boy, I'm just doper than all boy,

Oh my god boy, you didn't go there, no you did not,

Apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
We get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,
All I got to do is point to the spot,
When the bomb drops boy does it drop,
And when it does boy there's a problem,

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Boy dont jinx yourself,
Boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt,
String a bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I'm sick as hell boy,
You better run and tell someone else,
Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy who done said it :,
Who said he was better,
I bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
Back better than ever,
The chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I'll settle vendettas a little later,
Giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
By saying shady was ghost I aint even close the gate (?)
You bout to be put in a grave, stay put and behave,
Im bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
So hey wouldn't you say I'm the shit,
Couldn't agree with ya more fuel to say to my fucking shit doesn't stink,

You see, ain't no reason to sic the dogs on meGuess what?
I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in in a minute
Hey yo, this is my love song
It goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Henn' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk

And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is that you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And everything's spinning, you're beginning to think
Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches

You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyeing you
Get in the car and start it and start driving
Over the island and cause a 42-car pileup

"Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flying
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it

Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so"

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
Drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However I do show some respect to few
This Ecstasy's got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you

But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheating then I'm stuck with you"

But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more

So we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it

And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?

It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're going
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

But you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I woulda did more shit that people said that I shouldn't

But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growing up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwing up to spew

But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

Drugs really gotta hold of me
Really gotta hold of me
These drugs really gotta hold of me
They really gotta hold of megirl:  yeah... whoooo...shit
hmmm, whoaaa, hmm ... 
Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet, i'll come in in a minute
Aiyo, this is my love song. It goes like this....

Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more

So we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it

And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?

It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're going
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

But you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I woulda did more shit that people said that I shouldn't

But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growing up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwing up to spew

But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)

Drugs really gotta hold of me
Really gotta hold of me
These drugs really gotta hold of me
They really gotta hold of meGuess what?
I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in in a minute
Hey yo, this is my love song
It goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Henn' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk

And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is that you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And everything's spinning, you're beginning to think
Women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches

You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyeing you
Get in the car and start it and start driving
Over the island and cause a 42-car pileup

"Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flying
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it

Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so"

'Cause every time I go to try to leave (whoa)
Something keeps pulling on my sleeve (whoa)
I don't wanna but I gotta stay (whoa)
These drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

'Cause every time I try to tell 'em no (no)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
I'm a sucker, all I gotta say (whoa)
Drugs really gotta hold of me (whoa)

In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However I do show some respect to few
This Ecstasy's got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you

But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheating then I'm stuck with you"

But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more

So we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more

"Morning, doc."
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
"Anxious."
"Anxiety?"
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous."
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?"
"Um, not yet. But I mean, when I get back"
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
"Well, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?"
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule, we know you're a busy person."
"Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing."
"So what else are you thinking?"
"Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
"The steps?"
"Yeah, steps."
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
"Well, twelve."
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
"Really?"
"Anything else?"
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have is like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?"
"Take a drink."
"What?"
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
"Take the edge off?  Man, if I have a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
"Now, what the fuck!?"
"Marhsall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we?"
"Oh, no, no, no, come on, man!"
"Marshall, you can't leave me..."
"Oh, FUCK YOU, man!"
"....you'll never leave me, Marshall."
"NO!"
"We'll always be together, Marshall."
"NO!  NO!!!"
"Marshall...? Marshall!?"
"NOOOOO!!!!!"
[alarm beeping]
"Oh, shit..."Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

(Royce)
Classical poems
Battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn
Stabbing my clavicle bone
I'm at it or prone
First time I seen a dessert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
The 44 pop
First time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
Looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
In order to clean my things you need saline
I'm never referring to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang vroom
Get respect from the get-go, hello
Set to the echo, pyscho
Pen got a mind of its own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati
As the petrol swallows,
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
Check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,
Right now I'm living a dream
Though we may be reckless
The ladies check us
They whisper Shady records
Baby echo

Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

(Eminem)
I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time
I'm super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube
It's too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
My mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo
Oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful
Diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down...
To my sock and the hair on my toe
Learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
'Cause I ain't took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire
And this time I mean Imma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
Cause this time muthafuckers I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hoe yet
I'ma go get TIP and try to rip it wider

Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echoAye yo Paul, it's Em.
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing, and I know that he's not thrilled about the video.
What does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Well I'll show him who's really bad.

Paul, the way you make me feel with these calls, you should really take a look at the man in the mirror and tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough.
Do you remember the time we were watching the Billy Jean video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me, and it doesn't matter if he's black or white.
Because I can't stop loving him and I hate plastic surgeons, and I hope they all fucking die.

How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot.
I want to touch him, but I can't.

Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry.

Anyways, call me back, I have this idea about how I want to end the show.
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker.
Oh, and by the way, no I don't have a new gun (Goddamn it)Aye yo Paul, it's Em

Oh, and by the way, no I don't have a new gun (Goddamn it)[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
I owe you for this one

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sit and politic with passengers from 9/11
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines
Knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends
They know how to pretend

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong

[Bridge: Eminem]
If you're patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy
Let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit
They ain't sayin' shit — spray 'em, 50!
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi
And just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'?
You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, ‘cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier
You now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

[Hook 2: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50 — man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
‘Cause I'll break your face
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you makin' a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets
With all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94: "We don't love them hoes."
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the six
Niggas wearin' flags ‘cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood
And filled up with holes, motherfucker

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrongI've drowned in high from the ashes now
I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of every single grasp but ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken blown out window screaming, laughing
I love to feel the course hang out
This is our revival[Bruno Mars:]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Eminem:]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck, like lightning,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
Had a dream, I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
'Til nobody else even fucking feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Popping shit on how you flipped your life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks tryna kid?
Flip "dick", you did opposite
You stayed the same,
'Cause "cock" backwards is still "cock" you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that, long ago when Marshall sat, flustered lacked luster
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up, nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzin'
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circlin' around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, scuzzes, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's ribcage
And let it be known that from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9" but I feel like I'm 6'8″!

[Bruno Mars:]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Royce Da 5'9":]
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did, Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up, must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all bugging out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag...

[Bruno Mars:]
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight, we're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shine
'Cause, this one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lightersLook, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?(50 Cent) 
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shady 
Aftermath, ha ha 
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, ha ha 

First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight 
And if they don't let us in through the front 
We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without 
At least saying goodbye 
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 

(Eminem)
Get your ass up for the Doctor 
One more time, get your ass up for the Doctor 
Come on now, here we go 
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger 
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat 
Get on down 

(Dr. Dre)
Times up, game's over, you lose, I win 
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here 
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin 
Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in 
I go out and just come back full circle again 
You a fad, that means your something that we already had 
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad 

(Eminem)
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you 
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you 
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you

Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin' 
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin' 

First we came here to set this party off right

So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 

(Eminem)
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk 
Crunk, crunk, crunk 
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump 
Jump, jump, jump, jump 

(Dr. Dre)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it 
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches 

(Eminem)
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges 
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus 

(Dr. Dre)
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk 
Doc is all washed up, knock it off 
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'? 
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression 
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what) 
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump) 
That's why we always save the best cut last 
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

(Eminem)
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators 
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers 
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap 
Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces 
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages 
Broke down barriers of language and races 
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic 
And we can play the back and forth all day 
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to 

First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight

(Eminem)
50 Cent, come on! 

(50 Cent)
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do 
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know 
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved 

(Dr. Dre)
And plenty honeys involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees 
Cali, every day it's just another party from the valleys 
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally 

(Eminem)
Hands up for the grand finale 

Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak 
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week 

(Dr. Dre)
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to 
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker 

(Eminem)
So nervous, ain't never 'cause Shady Aftermath together 
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady) 
No one could do it better 
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh 

First we came here to set this party off right 
Let's bounce tonight

We'll come through the side

'Cuz I don't ever wanna leave the game without

So all my people on the left, all my people on the right 
Scream one last time 

(Eminem)
Yeah, ha ha 
Still Aftermath, 2006 
And don't worry about that Detox album 
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, ha ha 

50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre 
We ain't leavin', let's go! Ha ha 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace! 

...Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin' with me! *gunshots*
Ha ha, bye bye!

*final gunshot*

See you in hell, fuckers!spoken:
Lord please forgive me for what I do,
For I know not what I've done.

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Mama had a baby and its head popped off, head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
My mama don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off

Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn

Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle Edna 'n' Charles
Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles, Edna 'n' Charles
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song

It went a little something like Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Mama why do they keep saying this, I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, well what about me
Where does that leave me, well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream

While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like a comedian to you
Do you think that I'm kidding, what do I look like some kind of idi...
Wait a minute shit, don't answer that, why am I so misunderstood
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it such bullshit

Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again, whining about his millions and
His mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it

Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it, if you only knew the half of it

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds, please release me
From these demons, I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused, this Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again

What did I do that was so bad to deserve this, everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what to feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel

And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do si do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now

But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

I said father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Oh!

Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube!
Ew ew ew ewYou know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my-

Gotta concentrate against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it "Walk on Water" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You want it, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body baggage zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, "he ain't spit like this in his last shit"
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up"
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition, this is how I shot a head (pew)
Gabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sacrilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together some words, more than two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole this show
Sorry if I took forever

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy

Just remember-I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, unleash the monster
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em
See the show, every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Brush my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned, but I'm not gonna fall... bitch!

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire"What's your favorite scary movie?"

[Em] Yo, Slim Shady!
[R5] Yo, Royce 5-9
[Em] Y'all wanna make a movie?
[R5] What..
[Em] We got the film right here

[Royce]
What?
Yeah I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really hafta, I really slap ya
King of Detroit who they namin the city after (what?)
Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit
into your heart with, content, yo who wanna start with
experts, Bad and Evil is comin soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin (what?)
Leavin all of you cats shittin kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggaz be cockin pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin the profits with you (what?)
Six percent, of y'all niggaz is just pretend
Clicks with clits, pussy niggaz stink with dicks (what?)
Niggaz act bully, and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggaz packin semi
Speak darts; yo you get paid?  Rhymin about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
Five Nine, a street nigga with deep feelin (what?)
I keep illin, my steez willin to keep killin (what?)
Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that - you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder (what?) stick to my guns
Niggaz is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders
What?  Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'ma pit bull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw (what?)
Split y'all, holla, "It's on!"   Then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggaz get pissed on claimin you pissed off

[Chorus  x2: Eminem and Royce]

Y'all want drama?  Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin, directin and starrin in it

[Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin
Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
so fast it'll look like an invisible man standin
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this (here) and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
is gettin takin advantage of like Monica Lewinksy (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed
Screamin to Aunt Peg (AUNT PEG!!!!)
with three spokes stickin out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine
Damnit I like pain (AHH!)
and you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin you wack
You act up and I'm throwin you down a flight of steps
then I'm throwin you back up em
If they don't like the track, fuck em
The rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a Mack truck
and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch (Ding! Ding!)
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly (Hurry up man!)
I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin feet first out of a damn tree
to stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
and still have half left

[Chorus]

[Em] Bad.. the bad..
[R5] Uhh, when the bad meets the bad.. yo..
[Em] The evil
[R5] Take the evil with the evil
[Em] Put em together
[R5] What?  Nine-nine
[Em] Two times.. Slim Shady.. Royce the Five NineRihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me, and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin', fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship, isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize, 
even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of
The games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lieExternal linksNominate as Song of the Day

Armageddon, lets go

[Hook]
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, so sorry yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Lloyd Banks]
Hold up hold up hold up
New york city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homy
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green come on
Countdown to

[Eminem]
Armageddon
Lets go

[Hook]
I got a riddle what's little and talks big

What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Verse 1:]
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one more (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah

[Outro:]
Shady in the place to be seen
And i got what it takes  to rock the mic right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cuntsArtist: Tony Touch f/ Eminem



[Eminem]
If I'm elected for ten terms
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural
And hiring all girls as interns
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my ass (Look!)
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl
(Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)
The Bad and Evil movement is comin
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album 
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say
Whether it's one verse or one letter
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love(Intro: Eminem)
Makaveli, rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12 gauge shotty (feel me!)
{*Starts singing chorus in background*}
And this bitch said he should be
The lost forgotten seed of Tupac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me...!

(Chorus: Eminem)
Come get me
If you motherfuckas want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja

(Verse 1: Eminem)
You ain't no killa, you a pussy
That ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitch is wearin' rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted
In The Source stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loudmouths, pray to God hopin' no one's listenin'
See 50 comin' for me I'ma guard my, my position
No one'll pay attention to me, please Gotti
Here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
Now all a sudden I'm a fuckin' mad man who screams like I'm Pac
But I'm not, enemies, Hennessy
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted fuckin' with this shit
I'm suck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin' motherfuckas names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here partner, see you in hell, fucka

(Chorus: Eminem)
Come get me
Motherfucka, if you want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Get off that E
'Fore you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here down, Shady Records got it locked
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la locked

(Verse 2: 50 Cent)
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggaz is wastin'
Institutionalize my bitchez bring me product by the bundle
Hustle hard for da cell, G-Unit motherfucka, we ballin'
Catch me countin' cheese and when I'm callin', do you accept my calls?
Still let me sip on Hennessy, can I sip some more?
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckas thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talkin' about he left the hospital took nine like me
You livin' fantasies nigga, I been checkin' deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin', bitch, close yo mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggaz ball to let these bitch niggaz beat me
Black, you's a motherfuckin' punk and you'll see me with gloves
Quit scarin' them fuckin' kids with yo ugly ass mom
And you can tell them niggaz you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know yo bitch ass from way back
Witness me strap the mac, knew I don't play that
All these old rappers tryina advance
It's all over now, take it like a man (haha!)
Irv lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryina playa hate on my shit
Man, eat a fat dick!
Lovin' this shit, that's how you made me
Feelin' like I got you niggaz crazy
Uh huh, against all odds
ONly my thug motherfuckas know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds
Up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute, bitch!

(Verse 3: Busta Rhymes)
Ay yo, I been one of the most humble
Reppin' streets to the core
Ay Jeffrey, what the fuck you come and bother me for?
It's been a long time comin', like a blessing to check you
See, 106 and Park fans don't even fuckin' respect you
It's kinda funny, wanna be Pac, wanna fake like he thug
Runnin' around talkin' shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cock sucka, watch me handle you nigga
If I recall, Violator used to manage you nigga
They took a closer look and realized you wasn't impostured
There's never been a Violator on the Murder Inc. roster, dumbass
Now, who shootin'? Awww, made you look!
You said Bust' singin' the same old hook? You stupid!
If y'all shootin', I take a look at yo man
The bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Chedda bob ass niggaz, start adjustin' yo plan
You let the streets down nigga, apologize to yo fans
Watched you pull a lil' stunt like we ain't know what it was
Lil' faggot, desperate tryina reestablish a buzz
I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
The streets ain't never want you, Beatrice, whachu gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you
I think about the game and what it's like and
"What would it be without you?"
You finished, I ain't tryina repeat this
Just 'cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness

(Busta Rhymes talking)
Oh shit... it was fun...
Next time you got a problem man...
Address me before you try to make the shit a public issue homey...
Now I'ma return back to my regular self...
And have fun again... one![Em and 50]Man, lets go.
[Eminem]hey yo fif!
[50]yeah (yeah)
[Eminem]lets call 'em and tell 'em it time to hate us again, we're back!

(Verse 1 - Eminem)

Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)

(Chorus - Eminem)

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

(Verse 2 - Eminem)

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah


And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yeah boi don't curr'

(Chorus - Eminem)

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

(Verse 3 - 50 Cent)

Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
Riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying

(Chorus - Eminem)

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

Haha yeah it's the re-up
Haha
God I love it I know you hate that laugh don't ya
H ha keep doin' it
Do it again
What laugh
Oh HA HA
You know they're really gonna think we're crazy right?[IQ]
Your fakeness is atrocious
post is deep in your hypnosis
then focus
roll this
and smoke this
like L's
of that bomb-ass herb thats gaurenteed to rock bells
a hiphop refugee like Praswell
Travelin citys
pimpin babblin biddys
game trump tight and solidified
comupterized
to get rid of spies
know what I do to guys
shootin and spittin lies
I'm banished in exisdence
vanishin any instences
brandishin sentences
proovin repentences
the only way to see me, dont miss these
me and my crew smoke so many trees that
I piss leaves
never _my bitch please
but keep smokin my system, roll blunts it's all tight
on an off night
I still smoke like exaust pipes
and bust a universal flow
and blow your wig back like niggas with toupe's
drivin a convertable
and further more
I run the board
your shit is played and the way you fell off you coulnt bounce
back with a bungee cord

[Chorus]
Bring your boys in
we can bring the noise in
YOU DON'T WANNA FUCK WITH DIRTY DOZEN
[repeat 4 times]

[Bizarre]
My crew is like a maze
put fear like ex-slaves
who wanna step to this microphone and think that they brave
dozen always startin the fuckin beef
I don't care if your from Kansas I'm killin the fuckin chief
back the fuck up I'm releasin my dumb-dumbs
tell your whore stop pagin me 9 1 1
I'm the star
that they call Bizarre
smokin blunts with Mel Far (??)
in my brand new car
_wanna see me
even if I was in Arizona I'd still request iced tea
Bizarre don't give a shit about you
on top of the mountain ain't nothin your bitch-ass crew
can do
sick emcee that they call Peter
treat your crew like an unexpected meter
reader
fuckin more shit than Howard Corsell
Butt-fuckin Jassabells
in nasty hotels

[Chorus]

[Proof]
How you think your crew sound compared to this
it's the team that your entire clique scared to diss
demandin attention when the glock sound
y'all niggas to be murdered like Jeffery Daumer on lock down
I'm brown like Bobby, pullin hoe's like whitney
Take your title, kill your moms so you won't forget me
lips sealed nigga I might blow important plots
whoever fronts is gettin done like Micheal Jordan's pops
sure I'm number one translator my fame dirty D
y'all niggas gettin hung like this was 1933
got word of me
now flee
cause you don't got a chance
death is 3 easy steps so now we gotta dance
so look away
dont play
with the style master
I love killin beef so I kill a whole cow pasture
lyrically I'm sick, ill everything but sober
my nickle plate pack the _ jackin fool get fucked over

[Eminem]
Dirty Dozen is the clique so I ran over and lit cha
ripped the ass right out ya pants like a Dovermin Pincha
like the cobra and ninja
my intentions to injure
and prevent ya
from enterin from the edge of my center
or get your muthafuckin pants split at the creases
fuckin you intelectually givin you menatly sexually transmited diseases
my duty is to keep a strange abard (??)
I guard my sector like a Saint Bernard
and this ain't the yard
Bringin the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger
droppin your whole clique with one finger
til none linger
beware of my dogs attackin like a pack of Great Danes
chargin like freight trains
through the great plains

[Chorus]Eminem: Aite
Fred Durst: Check! Slim Shady, do the mic. kid

(Eminem)
I don't do black music
I don't do Withe music
I make fight music
For High School kids
I pull side full grips
When I drive like this {screech}
With a slipped disk

From a Limp Bizkit diss
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs
Don't attempt this shit
Just step back
While I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I said to the girl, I'm like
"What up girl?"
"Shut up girl!"
And showed her a cut-up squirrel
She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes
And kissed 'em on a futon
{Ay yo baby!}
{What do you want?!}
I looked at 'em both and I was like
"Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie pus"
I need to speak to 'em immediately
They played my video on MTV last week
And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some
In comes Fred Durst

(Fred Durst)
Yo Shady let me get some
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the diva
Hold the flavor of a single
See me and Shady?
I think we got a lock down
Shocked by the sound
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes
I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think
Could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths
Smelt like somebody farted
So if it's time for me to move on
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk
And a prick
Ramblin' on about how
He was gonna kill me
Wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no- He insisted we should go
Before I could drop 'em
Shady had to clock 'em
The music stopped
The party stood in shock
So I looked around
Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
But don't you
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all

(Eminem)
Turn me loose
You better tell 'em to come re-shingle the roof
Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke
And Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sick at the barn
I'm not bein' approached
'Cause Fred's over there stealin' all of my hoes
{Yo Fred save me some}
I walked up to these saimese twins
And asked to have a threesome
Told 'em two heads are better that one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up like "Ay wait, where you goin" {bye!}
Oh well
Three strikes and I'm out
I struck out and stood tied to the road {ouch}
I ain't tryin' no more
Fuck it- I'm chillin'
Get a shot of yable {ah}
Fell asleep on the ceiling

(Fred Durst)

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses."

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I amT.I.
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new, I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

"I said it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote

T.I.
It's stupid how I'm going knowing everybody knowing that
I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat, than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing it was this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind

Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago,
Ain't nothing new, I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote

Eminem
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah, you're late, your train left.
Mascara and egg smear on your face
Night's over, goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's coming up after I blindfold her,
She still comes back to my crib,
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But I won't buy her a soda
Unless it's rock 'n' ride cola.
Buy you a bag of fritos, I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Try'na pull 5 bucks from me is like try'na pull 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch, you're already bi-polar...

Eminem
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

T.I.
The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Peso, Euro, Yen, ah ha, I'm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is BANG!
It's so nice where I kick it,
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro, this road, we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

Eminem
Yeah I guess life is a bitcha, ain't it, TIP?
And this one can say this shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt of my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time in it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant, well, I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the "F" on dawg

T.I.
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came
They were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty, that's why

Eminem
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
T.I.
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
Eminem
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
T.I.
But still I ball like there's no tomorrow
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
"I said it's over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight, it's over with", that's all she wroteI done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
Victims to stick I'm fixin to pick some and start shit
I'm outta [repeat]
Pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat 'em to death, Benzino went deaf
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin' on, shit I been gettin' so bored lately
I'm thinkin' of doin' some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look
The game just isn't the same, it's changin
Shit Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin' the same shit
It's ancient, it's fakin
It's makin' me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
You think I'm the new Osama, press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us(Ja Rule)

Testing.. one, two (* Eminem hach-spits on mic *)
Ffff-fuck.. (My dick!) My nuts..

My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people 
who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!)
You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin, 
"Puffy is good, (HEY!) but Slim Shady is for the children!" (WAIT!)
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event.. +Been There, Done That+
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went 
(* zipper sound *) "Come on, let's go!"
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
Lesson One: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson Two: Face em and diss em (whattup dog?)
Don't give em a demo; kidnap em (I want you to come with me)
and make em come to your basement and listen 
(you're gonna fuckin check this out)
Lesson Three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus 
and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!) 
Lesson Four: 'Know you heard this before'
"Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the Withest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't 
givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin
cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master P (UNNNGGGGH!)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
my balls broke both of her collarbones (OWW!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah ("It's all about me..")
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea ("You're a dick!")
And all three of my main girls said SEE-YA
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah
(What? Oh my God!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass ("Oh! Ooh Shady! Oooh!")
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass

So if I hurt your self-esteem 
and you get dissed too bad [Yo why you diss me?]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had [A big dick!]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!" [Nurse! Nurse!]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway (WHAT?) and drive away (* car peels out *)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (MOOOOO!)
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with +Agent Orange+
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!)
The demon is here, steamin this year
I rip [*Mystikal's*] voicebox out, scream in his ear (AHHHHHH!)
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah I don't think this guy is well.." I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail

[* impersonating Method Man *]
I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that

You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?) Wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad"
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad"
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (yup) Sway & Tech
Sprayin wreck (bitch)
And we don't give a heck (uh-uh)
or a damn.. or a fuck.. or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin dick
Eminem
Girls (Limp Bizkit Diss)

Ayo dog
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that
I need to get off 'cause
If I don't
I'ma fucking explode or somethin'
Now look
This is the story about
Some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this

It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickenin
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shit list
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in a position that
I don't wanna be in shit
I never had beef with you corny son of a bitches
But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothin' to fix it
So I'm telling you right now
Motherfucker Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real
B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin
See he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin'
I'da never involved you
But you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known
That song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV
Now look who's mentionin me
That little fuckin' weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props on that song you on national TV
Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin' 'bout how bad you hate him
Now you all in his thong
What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin' sissy
Up on stage screaming how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act
And don't call me kissin' my ass
'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song
I'm trying to prewarn you
Lethal, when I fuckin' see you dawg, I'm swingin' on you
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw
Up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all are some

Girls (y'all are some God damn girls)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fuckin' sissies
You pussies keep talkin' shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, ha)
How fuckin' cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond
The beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked
See I was smart
I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I'll fight for Kim
All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all my dawgs from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Melman
Till I'm hoist away
In my coffin
I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I never give a fuck
I won't ever be interested
Love me or hate me
As much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated
The shit that I been through
My pencil never could pencil
But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
I'm not bein cocky
I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger
He sticks up his finger
I say fuck Christina
He says fuck Christina, but meaner
So from doin' a song with Method
To beggin to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred
With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin' you up punk
You're dead
Don't think that I'm playin'
And fuck Bizkit
'Cause I know you're sayin' fuck D12
Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves
Little

Girls (motherfucking females)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (now we all know the truth)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow down

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

And that's it
That's all there is to it dawg
If you don't wanna do the fuckin' song
Don't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV
Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dawg
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford
That's it
That's all you had to fuckin' say
I wouldn't a said shit
I woulda backed off
Did the motherfuckin song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it
That's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckingyou up shit when I see you
And I will see you, too
Oh, and by the way, Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Ha haEminem
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, till I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work

For me, it just wouldn't be sufficient enough
'Cause we are just gonna be enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree

There ain't gonna be no reason speakin' wit' me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speakin' Englais
So we gonna beef and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh

And settle this face to face and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangsta pee on himself
I see you D-12 and thanks but me need no help

Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony

Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all you, Ja, you'll get it too

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die (Uh)
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes

And go to sleep bitch (What?)
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Go to sleep bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

Obie Trice
We got you niggaz, nervous on purpose
To hurt your focus, you's not MC's, you's worthless
You's not them G's, you's a circus, you's no appeal, please
You's curtains you use words cool heard slurred in two thousand third

You's purpin', you's no threat, who's ya servin'
We lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth

And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse

And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the deaths

Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die (Uh)
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes

And go to sleep bitch (What?)
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Go to sleep bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

DMX
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin' New York wit' the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit' my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sweet

Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin'
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one, that started the fight

He be knowing how dog get, when dog gon' bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'Cause it's all good, it's all right

Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line and we can go track for track
Damn dog, why did you have to do them niggas like that?

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, mothafucka, die (Uh)
Time's up bitch close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes

And go to sleep bitch (What?)
Die motherfucker die
Bye bye, motherfucker, bye bye
Go to sleep bitch (What?)
Why are you still alive?
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch, uh, uh, uh, uh, wahoo
We're killin' all you motherfuckers dead, all you
Fake ass gangsters, no more press, no more press

Rot, motherfuckers, rot
Decay, in the dirt, bitch
In the motherfucking dirt
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, ha haWhat would it take to push a man, far enough
To put somethin' material over a human life?
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that?
The green and gold.

I done filled my lungs up
With so much of this crack smoke
My necks bloated, my tech's loaded
I'm flat broke, and I'm pissed off
Mad at the world I've had it with girls
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop
Just made it and hopped on
Ready to drop bombs on the first person
Who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot John, a white collar worker
In clean cut, walked up to 'em
He was like, "What?"
Whatchu mean what?
You know what time it is, man
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch
With that diamond wrist band
Got his green and his gold, dashed it,
Climbed in his van to steal it and seen
A man holdin a nine and then
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys, put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seatMet a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off, and beat him over the fuckin' head with the peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44-D

Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion

Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombest?!
We blowin' up your house, killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus

'Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more, 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before

Sabateur; walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul-style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!Narrator
Meet Eddie, 23 years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store.
(I can't take this no more. I can't take it no more, homes.)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play.

Dr. Dre
Alright, stop! (Huh?) Now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You'd better think of the consequence
(But who are you?) I'm your motherfuckin' conscience.

Eminem
That's nonsense.
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs. (Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

Dr. Dre
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you.
Think about it, before you walk in the door first.
Look at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns.

Eminem
Fuck that. Do that shit. Shoot that bitch.
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Dr. Dre
Man, don't do it. It's not worth it to risk it. (You're right.)
Not over this shit. (Stop!)
Drop the biscuit. (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo. He's bad for you.

Eminem
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude.

(It's all right, c'mon, just come in here for a minute.)
(Mmm, I don't know.)
(Look, baby.)
(Damn!)
(Look, it's gonna be all right, right?)
(Well, okay.)

Narrator
Meet Stan, 21 years old.
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play.

Eminem
Now listen to me: while you're kissin' her cheek
Smearin' her lipstick,
I slip this in her drink.
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...

Dr. Dre
Yo, this girl's only 15 years old.
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair.

Eminem
Yo, look at her bush. Does it got hair? (Uh-huh.)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Till she passes out and she forgot how she got there.

Dr. Dre 
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?

Eminem
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!

Dr. Dre
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?

Eminem
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail.

(Hee. It feels good to be home.)

Narrator
Meet Grady, a 29 year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work, 
He walks in the door of his trailer park home 
To find his wife in bed with another man.
(What the fuck?!)
(Grady!!)

Dr. Dre
Alright, calm down. Relax, start breathin'.

Eminem
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'.
While you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat! Cut this bitch's head off!!

Dr. Dre
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?

Eminem 
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?

Dr. Dre
Alright, Shady.
Maybe he's right, Grady.
But think about the baby,
Before you get all crazy.

Eminem
Okay! Thought about it. Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her
That's what I did. Be smart, don't be a retard. 
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?

Dr. Dre
What'd you say? 

Eminem 
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?

Dr. Dre
Imma kill you, motherfucker! 

Eminem
Ah-ah, temper, temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.? Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

Dr. Dre
'Cuz he don't need to go the same route that I went.
Been there, done that. 
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?
*gunshots*[Intro: Frogg]

Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

[Verse One: Eminem]

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson 
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus:]

So when you see me on your block with two glocks 
Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

[Verse Two: Eminem]

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Eminem]

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]

Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..People Say that I'm a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal teenagers newest idol
Come on!
Do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
People Say that I'm a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal teenagers newest idol
Come on!
Do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(Just pull the plug)
Hand me an 8 beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and shit on brandy and mase
I'm more then ill scarier then a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot and people who feel me 'cause I'ma still be the mad rapper weather I got money or not as long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot I'll be in a cannoe paddling making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get one mic and a source
And a woredrobe I can afford otherwise I might just send up
"Pack striking at ford" and you wonder what the fuck I need more vicoden for
Everybody's pissing me off even a No Limit tank looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
No shit I'm in grave danger to my health why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself
Course
I'm the illest rapper to hold the "cordless" patroling corners looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action then "rosco" beating james "star" Sr. across the back with vaccuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth with a fucked up childhood that I use as an excuse and ain't shit changed I kept the same mindstate
Since the 3rd time I failed 9th grade
You probably think I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it I don't promote violence I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps and land aside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind you and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again (Shit) why not blow your brain out I'm blowing mine out fuck it you only live once you might as well die now [just let it go]
Course

My laser disc will make you take a razor to your wrist Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
To sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a Role Model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin' me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I know that Just the Two of Us would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitchMom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why's the power off and I'm fucked up
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs but regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma

You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on

But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out, it's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (Little prick just leave)
Ma let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats, 'specially when dad he fucked us both

We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close, nope
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load

Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry mama for "Cleanin' Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause

Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but

Now the medication's takin' over and your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both

Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address

But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em

And although one has only met their grandma
Once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this, overwhelming sadness come over me

As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my Mom and my Dad

So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing

So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar
'Cause you're my ma

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost

And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die

Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die

Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life(Announcer) 
Welcome back, to the stage of history 

(Eminem) 
Yo.. Slim Shady! 
Yo.. I fuckin..I 
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww) 
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to 
The only key that I see to defeat you 
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you 
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe 
I lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse 
you think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
(Bitch!) I ain't a fuckin G, I'm a cannibal 
I ain't tryin to shoot you, 
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you 
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes just strapped to a soakin mattress 
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!) 
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis 
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket 
to fill it full of explosive plastics 
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while I sit back and just hope it catches 
Blow you to fragments 
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes 

Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X) 

I see the light at the end 
But every time I take a step, it gets dim 
Tell me is this hell we're livin in? 
If so, heaven's got to be better 
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down 

(J-Black) 
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never) 
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse 
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc 
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, fuck the liver spot 
One day we all gon' die 
But when I die, I'ma be so high 
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare 
with the chalk outline still there 
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot 
I got a cross on my chain but it's just to rock 
Now if I pray everynight (night) 
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight? 
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth 
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse 
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse 
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk 
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Northface 
Nickle nine at my waist, on the Lord's faith 
Angels greet me but I don't reply back 
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at? 

Chorus 1/2 

(Announcer) 
Maxi was seriously wounded but the soul still burns 
Final battle, fight! 

(Masta Ace) 
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso 
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso 
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger 
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger 
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound 
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds 
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger 
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her 
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her 
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager 
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel 
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel 
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder 
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder 
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare 
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care 

Chorus 

(J-Black) 
But every time I take a step, it gets dim.. 
Tell me is this hell we're livin in? 
Haha..

[Chorus]Singing with Spoken 
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Nah man, not quite finished yet.

Girl I think you just mighta tried to pull a mo'fuckin' fast one I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, tryin' to play games, see this saw blade
See the silhouette of a stalker in your walkway, better cooperate

Or get sauteed and rotisseried, while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet, you can hear a mo'fuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a mogwai

'Cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men
Vnnn-vnnn motor's so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin', not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
Will I spend spend even ten cents on you since when

Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty, just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe, while he's trying to roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go ya'll

'Cause...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

Get up baby get a move on, like a U-Haul, you can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it, evil I see hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit

Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every mo'fuckin' chicken 'fore it hatches
'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
So bad you gon' have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin

Unfashionable and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid at
Me bitch, I ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, Google it

Till it pops up, ya'll are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you've stopped up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth, till your speakers crap out, *fart* Ohp what
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette, "Chik-Chigarette"
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me, so do not strut my way slut

Because...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch, and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back in the Mathers, 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem, run boy

Every flow got it mastered, so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, yeah in other words I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any

Eat your heart out Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous, fuck an animal
I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya ho?
Shady I don't understand your flow, understand my flow, bitch I flow like Troy
Polamalu's hair boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare boy

I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare point, but you can't touch, I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man is there a void, all this weak shit, what am I steroids
Well bitch I'm back, with some shit for that ass, and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids

And remember boys...
(You don't own me, don't try to change me)
Now here we go, go, go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
Till next time

Check check

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dr. Dre up in here
Y'all know what this is
It's what y'all been waiting for
Funk Master Flex
Big Kap
Def Jam Records giving it to you, baby
Yo, Eminem
Show these motherfuckers what time it is, baby

Eminem
I used to be a lonely man (only mad)
Until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair
I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest
Before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again
It was an accident
I had my back against a fan
Who chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket, it ain't latching
They can't lock it
So they stapled my hand
To my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered
Like someone else had it before me
And just kept throwing them-fucking-selves at it
My head is aching
I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? (come on)
Anyway, I got down with Dre (what up?)
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the police"
When you still had your mother's fucking nipple
Stuck in your teeth (fucking baby)
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler, "Bravo"
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face, but I won't
'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it
With your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough
You just get drunk and become talkative (wanna fight?)
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block
Stumbling, mumbling a bunch of dumb shit
Like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs
When I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers
Slim Shady

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (ah)
Psych I'm just joking, for Christ sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailey Jade
Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter
Fuck you, lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes (fuck it)
The neighborhood that I grew up in
You could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me
So try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what
I can and what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the
Age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it
I'm tired, bitch
I'm dying to quit
Hip hop is universal now
It's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it
So they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic, it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder
I committed since three years old

Life; by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down, and every time you think you gotten past it, it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends, but they really your enemies with secret identities and disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers, they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around, swearing that they was always down!
What is life?
I'm tired of life!

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square, tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, 'cause I'd still be out robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash: broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
Tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john

Yeah! Guess who it is!
Aiyyo Dre! I think they in trouble! (WOO!)
Scott Storch! Why you have to do it like this to them?!
Feels like a new day

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Listen, now every time I come and I hit you niggaz with shit regardless
You get retarded and then the niggaz ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who
Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin zoo
Then I come and I spit all crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggaz do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggaz panick and freakin get schizophrenic and let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second check it I wreckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded that's why ya shit is through (WOO!)
You fuckin idiot I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo
You do not have a fightin chance to move you you were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do
G-g-g-goobers secluded you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do to you
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
Your probably wonderin why there's thunderin everyone
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block
Cause Bus a Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
With shady quietly tryin not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we always started we might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody come on let's get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet put somethin on and get to the club

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Catch you niggaz and snatch you niggaz you bunch of bumblin fools
Who got me rumblin dudes all way down the block
Keep on stumblin and jumblin over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggaz is on the clock
And you runnin out of time see I'm tired of all y'all
M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin n-n-nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your cd player and turn up the volume
You bang your head because your shit is not
I - continue with crumblin niggaz and tumblin niggaz
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin while I got you tr-tr-tremblin
For one of my niggaz bust ya head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brotha bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbin and fuck her then tell you bitch to get off my yacht

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'llWho came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world

(Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot (Ow)
Think I've got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot (Uh, oh?)

Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop (gulp gulp)

Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me I'm your friend when you need a mini thin(Slim Shady)
I'm Shady

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh huh huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)

The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh huh)

How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me help me)

I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school!)
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me I'm your friend when you need a mini thin (Slim Shady)
I'm Shady

I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Aw that shit is wack)
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit (What????)
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit
(Yup, uh huh)

But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we're on the subject (Uh huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playing when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed

Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms
Do drink beer
I just wanna make a few things clear

My baby mama's not dead (nuh uh), she's still alive and bitching (yup)
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itching
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me I'm your friend when you need a mini thin(Slim Shady)
I'm Shady

I told you I was Shady
Y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady
And that's my namespoken:
Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, 'cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, 'cause they be actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
Twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring, gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite(Footsteps and a belch are heard)
Whoooo!
Hey, how you guys doin'.
You want more?
All right, then SHUT UP!

Shoobeedoo (Shoobeedoo)
Shoobeedoo (Shoobeedoo)
Shoobeedoo (Shoobeedoo)

Here's a song for da ladies.Intro: 
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this... what is this...
The Invasion! yeah yeah Green Lantern! The infiltration! We're comin'!
Yeah!

I got 50 Cent, I got G-unit, D-twizzy in this bitch, wit' obie trice
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name, cuz you say one more thing, it won't be nice

Here we go,
I shoulda known 
I was bound to get pulled
into some bullshit
sooner or later 
you litte haters 
are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it, 
G-unit made it, 
then Obie's coming,
D-twizzy's comin, ya sick to 
ya stomach
50 percent of it's 50 Cent,
the other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' takin' our label down,
you better find our building 
and fly a fuckin plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get to intricate into it, 
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
cuz then it's gonna get to the point 
where it escalates into some other shit, 
then I'm a flip 
then I'm a get to
stompin' in my Air Force once, 
won't be able to tell if its two purrs or it's one
Cuz it's gone feel like so many feet kickin you, 
you think Nike just made these cleats into shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be,
but I get a woody, 
when these pussies try to push me
thinkin they gone put me in a position to pickle me
yall tickle me pink, 
I think I'd just rather have pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety,
a little bit of the diggety doc
diggety mixed with a little bit of the (em's voice scratchin')
what a small pinch, 
biggy look at me, 
I'm just a bomb diggety

(Chorus)
We the realest lable, we'll try to act like you don't feel our lable
cuz we gone fuck around and kill your lable! Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50, Shady 
records we the lable for sho!
We the realest lable, we'll try to act like you don't feel our lable
cuz we gone fuck around and steal your paper! Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50, we're 
gone kill your fuckin lable for sho!

(Bridge)

(Outro)

muthafuckas talkin, cuz we do, we see y'all, but we just gone sit back for a minute 
and see what the fuck y'all do!Ya mother...fuckin' faggot.

Hey yo...this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Schrody.
Rest in peace.
We'll never forget about you...fuckin homo.
We'll still remember.

There once was a man who liked to jump around. (jump around) (yo)
But he got too old to jump up and down. (up and down) (so then what happened?)
So he put the mic down and picked a guitar up. (picked a guitar up) (and then he what?)
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow. (no tomorrow) (come on)
Left his boys in the House of Pain. (in the House of Pain) (biach)
It was the wisest decision he ever made. (ever made)
But the dumbest thing that he could ever do. (he could ever do) (was what?)
Was try ta buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now whatchu gonna do? (now whatchu gonna do?) (haha)

Cuz I remember all those years (yeah)
How it was when you were here (c'mon)
I remember how it was (what)
How it was when you were young (yeah)
Yesterday was so long ago (long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more.

I remember back when you had the knack. (had the knack) (hahahahaha)
And I remember when you had your first heart attack. (heart attack) (*wheezing noise)
I was right there laughin' when i heard the news. (heard the news)
I just wish the cardiac would've murdered you. (would've murdered you) (damn)
Maybe Ice T's right, you are a bitch. (you are a bitch) (maybe he's right)
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich (leave when you're rich) (haha)
But the dumbest thing you could ever do (that you could ever do) (was what?)
Was try ta buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now whatchu gonna do? (now whatchu gonna do?)

Cuz I remember all those years. (what?)
How it was when you were here. (come on)
I remember how it was. (what?)
How it was when you were young.
Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. (Yo yo yo yo yo yo)

Remember back in '94,
Like right before Miss Everlast was Whitey Ford,
Before his heart attack had him on life support. (beep beep)
When House of Pain was out of fame,
Like someone doused the flame,
And they became destined to never jump around again.
Or even further back, when I first had heard the knack,
When you were down with syndicate.
I went to get the shit, man I was into it.
But then you went, and took your style, and switched the shit.
Now you sound ridiculous.
You dickless piece of shit, how could you diss me bitch? (huh?)
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude.
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you,
Started rhymin' then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nuthin.
Like you mad that someone else was white and tryin' ta rhyme or somethin'.
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin ta steal your light or nuthin.
But you're a homosexual, white rappin' Irish (unknown)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a (unknown) too.
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do.
What's up witchu?
I never fucked witchu, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what? Is you nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you, and I don't fuckin' sing.
And probably play guitar better, and I aint never touched a string.
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you.
I'm what you used to be; shit, you was me in '92.
So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you.
And maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues.
(la-di-da)

Cuz I remember all those years.
How it was when you were here. (I know)
I remember how it was. (how it was)
How it was when you were young. (when you were young)
Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more.

Cuz I remember all those years. (what)
How it was when you were here. (come on)
I remember how it was. (how it was)
How it was when you were young.
Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago)
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more.

Fuckin homo (pussy)
Fuckin faggot sissy (fuck)
And by the way, 380's a fuckin' sissy gun. (homo)
You gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun. (dont fuck wit me)
Little bitch.

Fuckin' punk pussy.
Fuckin' little bitch.
Fuckin' cunt.
Little fuckin'...fuck.Bone Thugs Akon yeah

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard,
I tried hard... but I guess I
Gotta try harder.

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin' a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin' crazy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off till later.

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

It's like I'm takin' five steps forward, and ten steps back
Tryin' get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh,
I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and
Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain
I keep inflinctin on my family (family)
Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'
And losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man
And I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin' not to panic

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause I...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' dough

I see thangs won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it
Keeps pullin me back mayne
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand no 9 to 5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean
Hustlers ballin in force I'm tryin' make that major league
So we never leave never, till the sun came up
Gotta get it nope no leavin' no rush
Today games they play gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool

I try so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I try so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault 'cause i...
Tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
But until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin' doughThanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go

Without no closure
So before I leave...

To basically say
Rest In Peace

Slim shadyEye-Kyu: Check it out,

Eminem: Hey Kyu!

Eye-Kyu:
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is all right (It's all right)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is all right (It's all right)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Verse 1: Eminem
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q

Eye-Kyu:
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is all right (It's all right)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is all right (It's all right)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Verse 2: Eminem
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

Eye-Kyu:
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is all right (It's all right)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is all right (It's all right)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Uh, it's ok, yeah it's all right, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's all right, I can't sleepIt's like that Eminem, Eminem all right bust it
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward dropping an acapela
To chop a fella to mozerella
Worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumpin you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of slugs
So were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with their asses ripped out of their pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Dr. Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpal in through the top of your scalp
And pullin your adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartmentIt's like that Eminem, Eminem all right bust it
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward dropping an acapela
To chop a fella to mozerella
Worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumpin you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of slugs
So were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with their asses ripped out of their pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of livin'
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Dr. Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpal in through the top of your scalp
And pullin your adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment[Em and 50]Man, lets go.
[Eminem]hey yo fif!
[50]yeah (yeah)
[Eminem]lets call 'em and tell 'em it time to hate us again, we're back!

(Verse 1 - Eminem)

Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)

(Chorus - Eminem)

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

(Verse 2 - Eminem)

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah


And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yeah boi don't curr'

(Chorus - Eminem)

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

(Verse 3 - 50 Cent)

Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
Riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying

(Chorus - Eminem)

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

Haha yeah it's the re-up
Haha
God I love it I know you hate that laugh don't ya
H ha keep doin' it
Do it again
What laugh
Oh HA HA
You know they're really gonna think we're crazy right?Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin' 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is... what you thought it wasn't...
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jan Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world," like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!

So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!!

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world," like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!

So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!!

Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world," like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!

So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you fin' ta get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!!

Shit, fuck everyone!
Outsidaz...
Pace One...
Young Zee...
Fuck the entire world!Guess who's back?
Back again 
Shady's back 
Tell a friend 

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright stop - pajama time 

Come here little kiddies, on my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap? 
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation 
Aah aah aah aah aah

No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise? 
Having touched on everything, but little boys 
That's not a stab at Michael

That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good god, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide

Up the center of the dance floor 
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go 
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
*farting*
Oops my CD just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip 

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah

Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah 

It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway

Feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there

Someone's gonna touch my body 
'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there?

What's your name girl? 
What's your sign? 

(Dr. Dre:)
Man, you must be up out your mind 

(Eminem:)
Dre, aah aah 
Beer goggles, blind 
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah

Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming 
Aah aah aah aah aah

Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape

Yelling at an old lady, 
"Touch my body."
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now

The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
A step back to reality 
Look it's B. Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle

I'm a grown man 
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Tubba Teletubbie

Fellas (What?) fellas (What?) 
Grab you left nut, make the right one jealous (What?) 
Black girls 
White girls

Skinny girls 
Fat girls 
Tall girls 
Small girls 
I'm calling all girls 

Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance whore 
Butt squeezin' it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah 
So appeasing 

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance

Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl

Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy we gotcha you on tape
yellin' at an old lady 'touch my body!'"

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Snap back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Yo you signed me up to battle!?
I'm a grown man!
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!

Ooh boy just touch my body
I mean girl just touch my bodyGuess who's back?
Back again 
Shady's back 
Tell a friend 

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright stop - pajama time 

Come here little kiddies, on my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap? 
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation 
Aah aah aah aah aah

No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise? 
Having touched on everything, but little boys 
That's not a stab at Michael

That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good god, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide

Up the center of the dance floor 
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go 
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
*farting*
Oops my CD just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip 

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it

Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah 

It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway

Feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there

Someone's gonna touch my body 
'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there?

What's your name girl? 
What's your sign? 

(Dr. Dre:)
Man, you must be up out your mind 

(Eminem:)
Dre, aah aah

Alright now lose it

Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah

Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming 
Aah aah aah aah aah

Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape

Yelling at an old lady, 
"Touch my body."
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now

Eminem: (laughing out loud)

Eminem impersonating Mr. Mackey & Eric Cartman :
Okay children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that (Shut up)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia (He's got AIDS)
Good luck Mr. Shady



Hi there, little boys and girls (Fuck you)
Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels

But first I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi Bob (Hi Bob), Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
He don't got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block

And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
Till one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job
When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uh
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to give Bob a doctor

Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found her
And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner

And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem):
See children, drugs are bad (come on)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (raise your hand)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
And there's really nothing else to say (sing along)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay



My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world

If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

Meet Zach, 21 years old
After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

Suddenly, he starts to convulse, and his pulse
Goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes roll back in his skull
His back arches up, looks like the McDonalds arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'

And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him."
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

Meanwhile Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga
And that's the story of Zach: the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem):
See children, drugs are bad (that's right)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
And there's really nothing else to say (Uh huh)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay



And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it (Yum yum)

And then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)
Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair

"Mr. Shady, what's a g-string?", it's yarn Clair
Women stick them up their behinds, go out and wear 'em
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops did I say magic mushrooms, I meant fungus

Your tongue gets, all swole up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at

But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't drugs and do exactly as I don't, because I'm bad for you

Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem):
See children, drugs are bad (uh huh)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can ask)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (and she will)

So kids say no to drugs (say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
And there's really nothing else to say (that's right)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay

Eminem impersonating Mr. Mackey & Eric Cartman :
Come on children, clap along (Shut up!)
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!...Ewww, ah!)
(So, fucked up, right now.)When I was just a little baby boy, my mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man, she used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it, 'cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They didn't say I can't rap about coke no more!
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore,
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin',
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it, just to be sayin' it?!
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you -
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos!
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?!
"Oh now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're god damn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives
Lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me

I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you (Haha)
I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither! You ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You'd better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me

I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you (Haha)
I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you

Know why I say these things
'Cause ladies' screams, keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks}
This eighty G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice—whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks!
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink?!
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knife-point, then you beg me to stop
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet!
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you! You hear me? Answer me!

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither! You ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth, with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothin' but a girl to me, bitch I'ma kill you

You don't... wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you
I said, you don't... wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady... will fuckin' kill you

Spoken:
(Haha) I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you.Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down... 

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down like toy soldiers 
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it 
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter

I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to 
I'm supposed to set an example 
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em 
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em

Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it 
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it 
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it 
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit 

And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted 
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it 
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it 

That was never my object for someone to get killed 
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good 
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' it

Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth 
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef 
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth 

While he's all over TV down talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like "Fuck it, I understand"
This is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause 

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down like toy soldiers 
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme 
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' 
But now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it 
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?

It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin' 
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' 
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him

Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it 
Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk

Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up 
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous

Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' 
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think 
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. 

And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind 
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us

We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is 
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is

But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it 
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further 

But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' 
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at your jaws with the knockin' 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down like toy soldiers 
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
But the battle wages on for toy soldiersStep by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down... 

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down like toy soldiers 
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers 

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure

If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em

Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it 
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it 
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it 
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit 
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it

I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted 
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it 
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it 
That was never my object for someone to get killed 
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
 
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good 
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' it
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth 
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about

Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef 
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth 
While he's all over TV down talkin' a man who literally saved my life 
Like "Fuck it, I understand" this is business 
And this shit just isn't none of my business."
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cuz 

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down like toy soldiers 
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers 

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme 
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' 
But now it's elevated 'cuz once you put someone's kids in it 
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?

It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin' 
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' 
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him 
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him 
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him

Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it 
Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk 
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection

Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
But now he's fucked the game up 'cuz one of the ways I came up 
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous 
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin' 
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then

When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think 
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. 
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind 
We still have soldiers that's on the front line

That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders 
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us 
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is 
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners

Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is 
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it 
Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict

I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further 
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' 
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man 
If y'all can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin' 
'Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin' 
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cuz 

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
We all fall down like toy soldiers 
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
But the battle wages on for toy soldiersLook, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go

You can do anything you set your mind to, man.Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lieYou know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
What the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window holdin' a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin' shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman ("Goddammit")
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
The instinct to kill N*Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids On The Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy and girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (ha, ha, ha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (he-he)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' "I don't care, just bite me" (nah, nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo root beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer
Faggy2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away 
I'm not a wrestler, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (ahh)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck (blaow)
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help
From D-12 to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus"? you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blond mop that's on top
And this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop? (pop)
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, your attorney Fred Gibson's a faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90-some cousins (Hey it's me)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey)
And then to top it off, I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see?  A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uhh, here - double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)

Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up?
Denaun: What up?
Maxine: Who dis?
Denaun: Denaun
Maxine: Yeah what's up?
Denaun: What are you doing?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Huh?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Why?
Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

Verse 1: Eminem
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son, she got her face done
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't trying to hear it
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!)

Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it... just... slows... down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch...
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said "Oh it's like that?"
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said "Maxine check this out,
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok"
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
I got up out

Denaun: Hey, Maxine
Maxine: What
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
Maxine: Yeah for a small price
Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?
Maxine: You know, money nigga
Denaun: You don't need no damn money,
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
Denaun: AIDS
Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?
Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit,
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
Maxine: No, see...
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that
Denaun: I want y'all to get paid, fucking...
Maxine: (laughing as the phone hangs up)[Intro]

Shady, we're back

[Verse 1 - Eminem]

Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
you better just make new living arrangements,
if you think your the top and king of the castle
You about to get thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is, I'm best at this an I'm best at that,
but I don't hear my name No man brought up in rap
and I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
but when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z
Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe they'll name me
Somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ
or say "he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay-Z
Yo, his verses were crazy on that Renegade beat
but I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And I all I hear is pop tunes come on the rad-i-o
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily"
And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
when they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
and make it big-big-big-big-b-baby

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]

So maybe the 80's made me crazy, I been tryin' to get my weight
up since the A Slim Shady gave me the gate key, paid the ways
So lately mind state's get better each day, replay my relay race
when I was chasin' the a fey at 18, 8 years later his voice in Beijing
no choice I chase cream so..

[Eminem]

Shady, we're back

[Verse 3 - Stat Quo]

This is what I eat, sleep, breath an feed my kids whatever I feel my family needs
I treat the mic like the block, fought with my rocks an squeeze critics who expect me to under achieve
I just deal with the hate I receive, I rollin' back my sleeves, ? show other bree with bran wrapped to
his knees?
An tell him suck my dick, take a bow an leave with a sack full of amar cheese, I found it hard to believe
Who the bullet perceive to be G's an claim there runnin' shit, nigga I run me
An as a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me, that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood asking where I be, dawg I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it drink my pee
Record songs for the Detox LP, feet don't fail heat, niggas got me bent like cranberry and bellvee?
I'm gonna die wealthy, boss of the game, what the fuck they goin' tell me, A-Town's own tre, Aftermath Shady

[Eminem]

Shady, we're back

[Verse 4 - Bobby Creek]

Y'all market y'all own block, they see me ???? that, rap game's an old flame my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth I got the right knit, sittin' here excited by some shit that
ain't right yet
No regret, live by a cold June, no bot, y'all niggas won't be satisfied 'till I show ??, go out on the
limb with Em 'cause I'm with him, put a barrel to they apparel to you an some of them
Stand a chance at the dance without a bowtie, Shady Records re-introduced you niggas to multi, so
hot, all the light that they given me an the haters like a chauffer because it's have driven me
To a view with a vendetta, I am the epitome, I don't give a fuck about you nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm just breezin' through the track, nigga

[Eminem]

Shady

[Verse 5 - Cashis]

I can prove I'm here to do somethin' you never do, from hand to hand coke sales for my revenue
I ain't been to a bucks an why I ain't snuck a weapon through, there's no
background reveals a 1-8-7-2, 'till the block I'm the truth, to the cops I'm the proof
And if a nigga's still out there you just gotta shoot, I carry over my street ethics to the booth
In the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth, the difference between me an you, I already done an
lived the street life, niggas run away from it, you follow my life, in the Midwest blunted, pitchfork's
held high, 4 5th by the stomach, you find me right now on the C.A. streets, I'm on the roof of the
building shootin' at police, some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me, I'm gonna walkin' obituary,
death live in me, I take life through the pen by the way I'm see I'll have you raped in the pen, like
American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight, from MS-13 with SK's, AR's an Mini-14's, I'm Ca$his, the last of
the real, were strapped on Prozac B's and E pills, it's the rap, got the block on tip, 2 ???? of crack
I'm in the light dark contract, Shady's back, nigga

[Eminem]

Shady, we're back
Ha, I told you we was back
Ha ha haSpoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies' neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad (ha ha)Spoken
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not, always make sense to you right now.
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip.
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad

Ay yo 50
Whut I tell you
We ain't even have to say shit
They did it
Ha ha

Monkey see monkey do
They'll never make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon always say and do
What the other one do
So let 'em come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see monkey do
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come
Now here they come like we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check mate motherfucker
Game's over we won
Tweedle dee tweedle dum

Doesnt take much
For me to race up and stank up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You don't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Like smearin bloodstains with a paint brush
I can't explain what it is my brain does
But however it works its insane just plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that's dangerous
It's a whole combination of things
It takes nuts
And I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
I'm paitently waitin for the day
I'm anxious
To see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
You're drunk you ain't tough
Whatever you drank musta just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talkin' motherfucker this ain't drugs
You wanna pop shit
Wake up
Then make up
Fuck that
It's to late chump now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calibur that nas and jay does
Opens up his jaws to say somethin' to rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
Till I peel the pain off
I never been shot but I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain
When they tried to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don't stop
Only thing that I wait for is the day that I don't gotta report to probate court
Cause ima give you all the reason to hate more
'Cause I've been holdin' my tongue till I got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list
It just ain't ja
And ima read the motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft cause 8 mile
When I come back
I'll be shootin more than just paint balls
Trust me

Monkey see monkey do
They'll never make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon always say and do
What the other one do
So let 'em come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see monkey do
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come
Now here they come like we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check mate motherfucker
Game's over we won
Tweedle dee tweedle dum

Fuckin' dummies
This ain't chess
You playin' motherfuckin checkers
This shit is all day man it's too easy
We playin' chess you playin' checkers
You bout to get your motherfuckin asses jumped
Fuckin' punks
And by the way
We ain't just talkin' to one person
We talkin' to every-motherfuckin-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bringin' it to anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don't pick up the ball if you don't wanna play man
It's all fucked up now
What the fuck am I s'posed to do now?
Huh?
What the fuck am I s'posed to do?
Haha
Yo we outI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible with liberty and justice for all...
It feels so good to be back..

I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back

(Chorus:)
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)

All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)

(Chorus)

Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryina tell us something,
Maybe this is God just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward,
That we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six...
Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
Cause I told you to fight.

(Chorus)

And as we proceed,
To Mosh through this desert storm,
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Do you guy's hear us...hear us...(laughing) (Hailie)I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America

Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

Left the keys in the van, with a Gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
This shit is in my hands, here's your life span
And for what your life's worth this money is twice that
Grab a couple grand and lay-up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description an' sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell an' hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the MAC
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried to escape in the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's Murder She Wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back till her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, I wasn't wearin' a vest...

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
(?) Backin' out, this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out and stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin' mouth before I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed a tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Johnny, go in and call the police.
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a (?) before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must o' been some dumb-luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must o' dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin' "Truce, truce!" (Don't shoot!)
Surrendered my weapon to cops.
"Wasn't me! It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps."

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

(Scratches to fade out)All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
All I see is murder murder, my mind state
Murder, murder, murder, and kill, kill, kill!

Left the keys in the van, with a Gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman

(Scratches to fade out)Spoken:
I don't know, dude...
I think everybody's all jealous and shit...
'Cause, I'm like, the lead singer of a band, dude...
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude...
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because...



These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

Eminem:
So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby
They're all like "Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fuckin' God, it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God, dude, you fuckin' rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock"
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my A Capella's
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Because I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, baby yeah!

Swifty: Alright, ok,  alright man, give me that mic man, ok, daw...gi...come on..
Eminem: Dude!
Swifty: Give me this mic!
Eminem: Ah, dude?

Swifty:
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
Hey dad how come we don't rap off Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no, I'm Swift ("Oh, I thought you was Kuniva")
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room?
Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, (uh-huh) it's simple but,
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back

Kuniva and Kon Artis:
Kuniva: Look at Em, little punk ass, thinkin' he the shit
Kon: Yeah, I know, man, by himself takin' on a flick
Kuniva: Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two
Kuniva: You gonna be late for sound check
Kon: Man I ain't goin' to sound check
Kuniva: Man our mics are screwed up
Kon: And his always sound best.. You know what man I'ma say somethin'
Kuniva: Hey yo, Em
Eminem: You got somethin' to say
Kon: Man, nothin'
Kuniva: I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man, what's up
Kon: Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
Kuniva: Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Kon: Man, whatever
Kuniva: I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band,
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands,
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man,
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

Proof:
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Hey yo, what's....)
Ready to snap on a dumb ass fan
Every time I hear
"Hey dude, I love your band"
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys actin' funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag)
Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
("Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!")

Bizarre:
God dammit, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like "Who is D12?" "How we get started?"
"But what about Eminem?"
Bitch, are you retarded
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
"Hey sexy"
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up (Uhh!)
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout start a group with the real Roxanne

Eminem:
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

Man, fuck this
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha)
But they all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer...
My Band
My Band (The Band)
My Band (Our Band)
My Band (The Band)
My Band (You Man)
My Band (You Man)
My Band (Roxanne)
My Band (Shantan)
My Band (Lets do it)

The hottest boy band in the world... D12!

Eminem:
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa (wooo ohhh), look out for my next single, it's called "My Salsa"
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa

Where'd everybody go?TV Presenter:
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do

*Door opens*
Who's your daddy?

Hailie:
Daddy, what're you doing?

Eminem:
Haha

Eminem & Hailie:
Ok then! everybody, listen up

Eminem:
I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me?

Hailie:
Somebody, please help him
*giggle*
I think my dad gone crazy

There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to

Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall with my framed autograph
Sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall

I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off

Dr Dre:
Suck it Marshall

Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off

And launch one of these russians and that's all
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off

*Knocking* Haley, tell 'em baby

Hailie:
My dad's lost it

There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
(I think my dad gone crazy)
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(I think my dad gone crazy)

It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom* Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine
N goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'

Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch
Eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick
A million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record

I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring
In my nose then quit bringin' my flows
Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why I'm so mean?

If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

Hailey:
Dad

There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
(I think my dad gone crazy)
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
(I think my dad gone crazy)
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(I think my dad gone crazy)

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, so what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter

Pret it at first, cuz when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once

And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as Bump 'n Grind comes on

More pain inside o' my brain
Than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade

And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

There's really nothin' else to say ha, I can't explain it
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
"(I think my dad gone crazy)"

Crazy
You're funny daddy(Eminem)
{*Yawns*} Yeah, look

If I would've rap about the crap that's out, that's the route
You probably want me to take 'cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Here my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall you'd probably crap in your pants
'Cause I'm white and he's white, so he's like
My competition I mean, right? Nope
Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so
{*Blblblbl, pbbbbt*} B-b-b-b-b-b, but
I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite break
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em, full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"

(Chorus: Eminem)
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Eminem] + (devil)
(Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here
Talk to me, sit, here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? {*laughs*}
Dye it back, c'mon try it) Ah!
No I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you?!
(But I'm here to rebuild you) But I already killed you!
(But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother) Yeah, so what of her?
(You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes) FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
I had you beat! (No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm takin' it back!) You fuckin' bitch, WHY?!
(Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Hahaha!)

(Chorus: Eminem)
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Eminem] + (devil)
(Shady, listen - "SHADY!" - you hear that?
They're screamin for you, I can bring your career back)
But I don't want it back (Yes you do) no I don't
(Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later) No I won't
(I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor)
Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday
(Well I got him on the phone right now)

[Dr. Dre] + (Eminem)
Slim (you're lyin') yo Slim! (How, why now?)
(Whattup Dre?) Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer
(But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka)
Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up (FUCK THIS MIRROR!)

{*Glass breaks*}

[Eminem] + (devil)
Ah! (I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you) FUCK YOU, DIE YOU
SON-OF-A-BITCH! {*gun cocks*} (Put the gun down) Bye-bye!
{*Blam*} Okay, I'm still alive (so am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you
Prayed to God you'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you're just now seein the downside to?
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you?
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall) WHAT?! (No one's gonna love you like I do)

(Chorus: Eminem)
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

(Eminem)
I said I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body {*echoes*}I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

(Eminem)
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved (whistle)
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here" *knocks on the door*
"Who's in the den?"
(R) "It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad, (sorry) let's try another room"
(S) "I don't trust you!"
"Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods
(S) "Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party's so drag"
"Oh, dag! I didnt mean for you to eat the whole bag!" (Huh?!)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
(I'm sorry!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

Yo Sue
(S) "Get away from me! I dont know you"
Oh shoot, she's tripping
(S) "I need to go puke"
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying I dont hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
She said (S) "Help me, Slim, I think I'm having a seizure!"
I said "I'm high too bitch, quit grabbing my t-shirt! (let go)
Will you calm down, Sue?  You're starting to scare me."
She said (S) "I'm 26 years old and I'm not married!
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook!"
I'm over here Sue, you're talking to the plant look
We need to get to a hospital before it's too late
Cause I never seen no one eat as many shrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
(It was an accident!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

Susan (wait) where you going, you better be careful
(S) "Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled!"
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors before you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill baby please
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
John where's Dave at before I bash you
(J) "He's in the bathroom, I think he's taking a crap dude!"
Dave pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, chopping her hair off
And theres only two days left of spring break,
how long does it take for these things to wear off?
(D) "Well it depends on how many you had"
I took 3, she eat the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol
(D) "She's gonna die, dude!"
I know and it's my fault (My God!)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
(I'm sorry!)
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
(What did I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My god, I'm so sorry!  I'm so SORRY!
Susan, please wake up!
Please!  Please WAKE UP!  What are you doing?
You're not dead!  You're not dead!
I know you're not dead...
Wake up...
Susan, wake up...
Oh, my God......Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
OK, aight... aight, aight, aight, aight...

Yo, yo
Aight, I'ma lay the chorus first

Here we go now!

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom my mom, I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom oh-ho whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty and how I became hooked on va-al-iu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomach aches
Now tell me, what kinda mother would wanna see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
What the fuck you sticking gum up under the fucking seat for
Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfuckers been puffin' reefer
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a tea cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleepin', what the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the
Fuck alone I ain't playing, go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
 
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner this is paint thinner
”You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
Now here's a plate full of pain killers, now just wait 'till I
Crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes ya'
Little motherfucker I'll make ya sit there and make that re-
tarded fucking face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it, 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, your gonna just sit there in one fuckin' place finnickin' till next Thanksgivin' and
If you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me it K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support your father he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did, it's none of your dang business kid!”

My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
Because

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom loved Valium
Now all I am is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with my Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about 2 minutes
But I don't want to swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
My Valium (my Valium)

Man I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict naw, fuck that I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happening
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And that's probably where I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb ma beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
”Here want a snack you hungry you fuckin' brat?
Look at that it's a Xanax take it and take a nap
Eat it” but I don't need it, “well fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up”
Alright ma you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble hobble tumble slip trip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobble head

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, I'm just like her...

My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom... My mama!

Me mama...

Sorry, mom
I still love you, though

Dr. Dre, 2010
Hey, this shit is hella-hole, homie
Yo, take us on outta here
Whoo!Hi! My name is... (What?) My name is...
(Who?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady
Hi! My name is... (Huh?) My name is...
(What?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady
Hi! My name is... (What?) My name is...

Hi! My name is... (Huh?) My name is...
(What?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady

(Ahem. Excuse me! Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)

Hi, kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah-yeah-yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)

My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Umm...)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uh! "Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"

Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self, from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off, and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard, I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch, who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!

Hi! My name is... (What?) My name is...

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler, stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow-w-w-w!)

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extra-terrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a spaceship, while they're screamin' at me, "Let's just be friends!"

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out, my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh, thank you!)

You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh! Ahhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!'

Hi! My name is... (Huh?) My name is...

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh, yup!)

Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (Hahh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How ya gonna breastfeed me, mom?! You ain't got no tits! (Waah, wahh!)

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad, (Arrhh!) and by the way when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Hi! My name is... (What?) My name is...
(Who?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady
Hi! My name is... (Huh?) My name is...

So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!'

Hi! My name is... (Huh?) My name is...
(Who?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady
Hi! My name is... (What?) My name is...

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh, yup!)

Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (Hahh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How ya gonna breastfeed me, mom?! You ain't got no tits! (Waah, wahh!)

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad, (Arrhh!) and by the way when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Hi! My name is... (What?) My name is...
(Who?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady
Hi! My name is... (Huh?) My name is...
(What?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady

As heard on: Curtain Call: The Hits

My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high, the only problem was, my English teacher was a guy

Extra-terrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians, while they screamin' "Let's just be friends!This mother fucker again?
Just won't shut up, will you?
Talkin' 'bout I owe you
Bitch you owe me, I'm promoting you right now
Let's put the nail in the coffin

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear this grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks 
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

(verse 1)

I would never claim to be no
Ray Benzino
An 83 year old, fake Pacino   
So how can he hold me over some balcony 
Without throwing his lower back out
As soon as he goes to lift me?
Please don't, you'll probably fall with me
And our asses will both be history
But then again, you'll finally get your wish
Cause you'll be all over the street like 50 Cent
Fucking punk, pussy, fuck you chump
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tryna jump the ruff ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, thats how much you suck
Dick in the industry
Swear that you in the streets, hustling
You sit behind a fucking desk at the Source butt kissing
And begging muthafuckas for guest appearances
And you cant even get the clearance
Cause real lyricists don't even respect you, or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you,
We hate you, period!
Talk about a midlife crisis, damn
Last week you was shaking Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a busta? What the fuck's with that
Get on a track dissing us, kissing 50's ass
And asking me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got two cases, and probation, fight me!
What do I know about standing in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands 
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists 
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world,
A little girl
And I'll put that on her
When this is all over
I would never try to make her a star, and eat off her
I don't shit about no shopping rocks 
But what you know about hip-hop shops, rocking spots
When you're the only white boy up in that bitch, just ripping
Pressing up your own flyers, and your stickers
Sticking them bitches up after spending six hours at Kinko's 
Making copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your tracer
Spending your whole pay check at disc makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life
Oh thats right, you should know what that's like, you're half white!
Vanilla ice, full of beans and rice, I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
You should be out killing muthafuckas right now
Kill a muthafucka dead, kill him dead bitch
Shoot him in the fucking head, go ahead bitch
Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of you
Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck 
You're a fucking joke, if you was really selling coke 
Well then what the fuck you stop for, dummy?
If you slew some crack,
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch, ain't it,
Raymond? Here, let me me break this shit down in layman's
Terms for you just to make sure
That you can understand this and Canibus ain't using
Too many complicated fucking words for you 
Here, let me slow it down for you so that you can understand if I say it slower:
Let it go, dawg, it's over.

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear this grandfather rap
And old men have heart attacks 
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

(Eminem talking)
Haha, talkin' about I have muthafuckas calling your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fucking crib
You don't even got a fucking phone, you fucking punk
Threatening to shut me down at your little fucking Source magazine if I come back at you and attack you 
Bitch, you attacked me first, take it like a man and shut the fuck up
Fuck you little magazine to, I don't need your little fucking magazine 
I got XXL's number anyways, 
And y'all cant stand it cause they gettin bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way how'd I look at the VMA's?
When you was watchin' me, from what ever fuckin TV you was watching me from
In Boston, the mean streets of Boston
Fucking sissy
And you gotta stand up you mutha fucka
Suck my mutha fucking dick
Oh, and for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted, y'all
The Source has a white owner!This mother fucker again?
Just won't shut up, will you?
Talkin' 'bout I owe you
Bitch you owe me, I'm promoting you right now
Let's put the nail in the coffin

The Source has a white owner!Eminem
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that ass on the flow
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up

Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Nate Dogg
2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat

3 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock

Get ya ass off the wall with your 2 left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We about to have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day, she be givin' it up

Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Eminem
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow, and I'll finish

Yeah me and Nate D-O-double G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party

Nate Dogg
Have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Eminem
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

'Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

We about to have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be givin' it up

Eminem
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control

Come on, I ain't leavin' without you, bitch, come on with me
And my boy and this boy and this boy and his girl... Nate DoggLil Wayne
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's Fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, uh

I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg

Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

Eminem
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

Lil Wayne
Yeah

Eminem
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
(Don't hurt me)

Lil Wayne
That's right (Don't hurt me)
I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Huh

Eminem
Bitch you get no (No love)

You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)

Lil Wayne
That's right (You don't hurt me) And I don't need you (No more) Don't want to see you (No more)

Eminem
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love)

Lil Wayne
And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em

Eminem
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow

Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

Eminem
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now

I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow

Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

Eminem
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now

Lil Wayne
(Yeah)

Eminem
You kicked me when I was down, fuck what you say just don't
(Don't hurt me)

Lil Wayne
That's right (Don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)
Huh

Eminem
Bitch you get no (No love)

You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And I don't need you (Don't hurt me)

Lil Wayne
That's right (You don't hurt me)
And I don't need you (No more)
Don't want to see you (No more)

Eminem
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love, no love)
Hah, bitch you get
(No love, no love, no love)

Lil Wayne
And I don't need you (No more)

Eminem
Bitch you get no (Love, love)Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Getting in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not till she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how-

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun'
We over; kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted?
I'm with someone so unlikeable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face till I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skrt off
And then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) (Yeah) to take a stand (to take a stand) (It's been a ride)
Everybody (I guess I had to) (everybody), come take my hand (Go to that place) (come take my hand) (To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same roadI'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) (Yeah) to take a stand (to take a stand) (It's been a ride)

Yeah

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Pay less, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop
Playtex, ice spots
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we were on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (whoa)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spyder move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Capri styles, am I a G?
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all in the stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
When the cops set us up, we can flush the shit down
We can no give a fuck, shit, a fucking Kehlani
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya it vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in prince pants
You niggas

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Payless, high-tops

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ay)
The people you run with are fucking (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna do something
Acting like you catching bodies (ay)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery, bitch, you ain't plugged in nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put up
Strap on, in other words if you're a gunner
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
It's tough to me now, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne if you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfucker, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, really, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy, cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R.I.P. Prodigy
Soldier in my soul and I told them the moment he signed me that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch, it's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein, a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is groper, I roleplay with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives, I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Roll dice to globe in and I'm (??) tryna throw in (?)
They both hate to choke and my hoe play the (?)
And I double-edge sworded 'cause one place I poke and I stick and I turn and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals, take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formiddable, that you're bitches are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, solider
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One mother older
Sponge, mob, colder
None, rug, hoaster
Lug, nut, coaster
Lung, jug roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, we were on it (yeah)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic

Em: The bad
Royce: Yeah
Em: The evil
Royce: Right, yo
Em: Put 'em together

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin' to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin' to slit
If it wasn't for the 'shrooms, I'd have nothin' to chew
Yo, I'm just fuckin' with you, 'cause I got nothin' to do

I am bored
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin' your wallet off
And slippin' a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burnin' your contracts, punch your A&R in the face
Smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missin' I took it (whoops!)
Nurse, look at this straightjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive, runnin'?

Royce:
Comin' with five gunmen, waitin' to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhymin' about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really said it without words
Yo, you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's rainin' slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin' me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin' blood and spittin' phlegm up
Now we rivals, 'cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and Bible

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin' to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin' to slit
If it wasn't for the 'shrooms, I'd have nothin' to chew
Yo, I'm just fuckin' with you, 'cause I got nothin' to do

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin' to strip

Yo, I'm just fuckin' with you, 'cause I got nothin' to do

(Eminem)
Forget a chorus; my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
And by the time you all catch on, I'ma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin' to fall back on
I'll throw you off of ten floors
Pull a fuckin' headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waitin' for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, "It oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch?" "No, but I brought a napkin."
Gettin' skullie while I'm autographin'
Got my daughter laughin' 'cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin'
I'm not a fact, I'ma proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-Haul screamin',
"Wait, wait, wait, you ain't movin' here!"
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souvenir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference -- I need some 'caine
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

(Royce)
Walkin' in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin' my fame, blowin' your hand off
Dancin' with the Devil leadin'; I won't die, I'm never leavin' (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin'
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a death wish, thinkin' I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchman, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through 'em, put the heat to 'em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin' to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin' to slit
If it wasn't for the 'shrooms, I'd have nothin' to chew
Yo, I'm just fuckin' with you, 'cause I got nothin' to do

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin' to strip

[royce] yo..
[both] Iâm just fuckin with you, cause I got nothin to do

[eminem]
I am bored!!!!!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors dâoeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while Iâm rippin your wallet off
And slippin a molotov in your cocktail (take that)
Burnin your contracts, punch your a&r in the face *punch sound*
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
Iâm on some shook shit, if itâs missin I took it (whoops!)
Nurse look at this straightjacket, itâs crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (fedex)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head
When the rest of his bodyâs still alive runnin? 

[royce]
Comin with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what? ) hide from it
For every hundred mcâs rhymin about birds
Only about two-thirdsâd really set it without words
Yo you ainât a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear itâs rainin slugs (what? )
Iâm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The bad and evil mad rap, I cover the bad half
You know how a thug in this shitâll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what? )
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Chorus: 2x

[eminem]
*yawns* forget a chorus -- my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
And by the time you all catch on, iâma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on!
Iâll throw you off of ten floors .. *ahhhhhhh*
Pull a fuckin headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
Iâm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, it oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch?  no, but I brought a napkin
Gettin skullie while Iâm autographin
Got my daughter laughin cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin
Iâm not a fact, iâma proven fear
Mr. rogers blocked up my u-haul screamin,
Wait, wait, wait.. you ainât movin here!
Lorena bobbitt, câmere, want a souveneir? 
Iâve been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile?  same difference -- I need some âcaine
Cause I ainât sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(oh my god!) brain implants and they say thereâs a slim chance
I wonât stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanzâ

[royce]
Walkin in swamp water with an m-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
Iâll display hate and break you in eight places (what? )
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the devil leadin - I wonât die, Iâm never leavin (what? )
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts, what?  my meatâs bigger (what? )
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinkin Iâm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what? )
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

[Chorus – Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Verse 1 – Dr. Dre]
Niggaz is so gangsta, Niggaz is thugs
Niggaz'll spend their whole life peddlin drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggaz came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cuz them niggaz just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggaz get behind mics and ain't even MC's
Niggaz get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughin all the way to the bank
Watchin the satellite from a Bentley
You niggaz don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin
The media just feeds into these feuds
Tryin to add fuel to the fire.  This little nigga, Ja Rule
Talking bout he's gonna slap me.  Nigga please
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview em
All they doin is making fake threats to us through em
And pussy you're not Pac, I knew em
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fuckin insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passes
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin your ass
You're talkin to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your ear?  I don't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit tryin to be tough, nigga, you look like a asshole

[Chorus – Eminem]

[Verse 2 – Obie Trice]
They say why don't we increase the peace
The only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps
Cuz niggaz run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 4 5 will cease the speech
Yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets?  I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them wit you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the women and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis, pull your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off.  Damn
And quit tellin all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're ficticious
Nigga, we send Stan to come murder your bitches

[Chorus – Eminem]

Hahahahahaha
Yeah, yeah
Go out behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter fact, go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody rap wit you
You can't see that?
Fell off, nigga
Hahahahahaha
Damn, damn
Shady slash Aftermath, motherfucker
2003 to infinOh no what's happening to my brain
I can't believe this is happening again

Lava out my lips I flips
Wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man
I think I need another mask
I'd ask my mother but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abraf-ckingcadabra motherf-cker look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring
First I Re-up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
'Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see Nyquil

Oh no
Here we go again
When it's going to end
Where did it begin
Maybe way back when

Into the well, baby Jessica fell
She may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail
Every day in journals saying how
She wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo

I'm the medicine man
My medical marijuana was prescribed by a doctor
Shove a typewriter up her
Perez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
And f-ck it while I'm venting let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard's bare
Stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there

Vicod* like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who am I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
I'm nice when I'm like this, no time to write just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man I'm about to hyperventilate, I just have hyper-tension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again[Intro:]
Dirty Harry is dead [x4]
I'm here to announce that Dirty Harry is dead
Now witness the life of his son, or Oil Can Harry, The Boss

[Proof:]
My life is trapped in these lines, that's why I'm packin' these nines
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back on my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers til I'm snappin' my spine
Naturally, I gotta focus
On these bogus poachers, lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda
Hold up
[Eminem:] (We nothin' but soldiers)
Slow up
[Eminem:] (This gun is loaded)
Roll up
[Eninem:] (They beef and we leavin' 'em coked up)
If Em say it I spray it, if he willin' I kill it
We kill packs to get iller Detroit, y'all can feel it
Got this gun on my wasteline, in war we don't waste time
Ja, man he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got School Craft here at the 7, 8, and text her
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, bet'cha ya flinch
When Proof shoot up they coup, and wet your whole clique
Fuck it who's next on this shit, this is prefrence to bitch
When you preface to stiffen slugs enter your wig
You'll be next to BIG, Pac is destiny kid
Before ya lead get popped, stop testin' me bitch

[Chorus:]
Homie you think you tough (what)
Think we won't fuck you up (punk)
Even the innocent get pistol-whipped by this pistol grip (punk)
Talkin' shit you drunk (what)
Think I won't fuck you up (punk)
We both deep, I ain't scared and I don't give a fuck (jump)

[Proof:]
I ain't feel no games, homie don't even try
We ain't bowin' down to no one we gon' start a riot (yeah)
Heart of fire, soul of ice, roll the dice, see what you get
No advice, all my life I ain't leavin' in this bitch
I'm a man, more I'm holdin' my ground
To loadin' these rounds, at any call approachin' my ground (blah)
I'm a kid but grimey, nothin' but killas
And behind me, I'm a bully fully cuz your team is tiny
If I was to crush 'em, got to say these Bibles are nothin'
This rifle on clutches to leave you stifled on crutches
I fight for my cousins that ain't even related
Even I stated, not from life I leave you bleedin' and faded
Hatin' made in my nature, I'm clappin' and clackin' your captain
Smackin' faggots and act as a rapper with platinum status, ya livin'
flappin' 'em slappin' 'em backwards
After these rappers' status
To shadders, knowin' Proof and that Mathers has gathered an army
It's Shady bandatas
After rest the game is won, who in the matters get blamed fast with brain damage
The name that some forgot, D12, it ain't hard to feel, guard ya grill, it's REAL!

[Chorus](2pac)
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
'Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open free, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...

(Eminem)
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
There's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing...

(Outlawz)
One day at a time

Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
That's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains

I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I can't win so I'm inviting some help
And every now and then I take rights from left
I'm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
No matter how much I try (stay alive)
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride

Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
And we continue growin'...

(2Pac)
...One day at a time. Damn!Heh, yeah, haha
You know critics man, critics never got nothing nice to say man
You know the one thing I noticed about critics, man
Is critics never asked me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog, try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this, I could blow, fire in the hole

I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flow's tighter, hot headed as ghost rider, cold hearted
As Spider-Man throwin' a spider in the snow

So you better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a low-rider
With no tires in the hole
Why am I like this, why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the ho's

Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off

The Wizard of Oz, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws

So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit

You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire

I just put a bullshit hook
In between two long ass verses, if you mistook this for a song, look
This ain't a song, it's a warnin' to Brooke
Hogan and David Cook, that the crook just took over, so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightnin' in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter
Like hot grease splashin' a fan, Mr. Mathers is the man

Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man

Turn him into plastic, so for you to think that you could stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flying crayon

Fuck it, I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand

So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop

Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody'll fuckin' test me 'cause these ho's won't even dare

I'm wastin' punch lines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so, im so hot
My muthafuckin' fire truck's on fire, homie

You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fireHey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man
Ya'll been here every weekend man,
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
That's cause you whack!
What?!? I ain't whack nigga, I got some raps for all ya'll
Nigga my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first,
you can bust yours after me if you want to
No no man, I'm going first,
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
You always rap first,
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say,
I'm fresh, I'm fresh

Thyme:
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know

Verse 1: Eminem
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced when I fill your back with knives
Jacking lives of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You best just set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula

Chorus: Thyme
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know

Verse 2: Eminem
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deteriorate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be, and
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache, wither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fishermen's sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence (take offense)
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

Verse 1: Eminem
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced when I fill your back with knives
Jacking lives of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man so unless you want what he got

Here's the story... Of a little boy
Growing up in a suburban home
Tryin to cope with everyday life
He lives in a little house
That was built in the middle of the street

(E)
Hey mom tupac's on the juke box
(D)
So what, he shot 2 cops
And raped a little girl watchin news watch
(E)
Nuh ahh they were tryna frame him
(D)
You and that Tu Pac shakur
(E) 
No that ain't how you say his name mom
You're so lame.. Dont you know anything?

(D)
Stop Cussin at me!
(E)
Shut up bitch!
(D)

(E)
Well slammed the door and I'm out
Now what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket
I forgot it was winter
I'm Gettin Thinner
I'm hungry, is mom cookin dinner?
Mom let me back in i forgot my coat!
Mom come on I'm not playin its cold!
Aight sorry I need a jacket
Mom look! My TuPac tape I just cracked it!
Mom please let me back in
It is TuPac Shakur
I just asked him!
I'm Freezing (*sneeze*) I'm Sneezing
I'm breathing to much cold air
I'm Wheezing
I ain't did nothin
I ain't say im leaving 
I said I'm goin on the front porch to get something!
(*cutting noises*)
(D)
Aight Here Take Your Damn Coat And Leave!
(E)
Fine I'll leav--Mom You Cut Off The Sleaves!!

(chorus)
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...(1, 2 ,3)
In the middle of the street

(E)
My teacher's two faced
He went to lower all my school grades
Cuz last thursday i had a tooth ache  from kool-aid
So mom kicked me out
(D)
Get Out!!
(E)
All i had was my suitcase, 
A shoelace, a tube sock 
And a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool
Cuz i could go to a freinds
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather be home
In my own room, Alone
beatin my shit 
And nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle till he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is.."
But as soon as mom found it
I would either get grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks
I'm still countin!
Even when I was under age......
Mom was tellin cops i was tryna run away......
I told her "Some day bitch, you gonna pay...."
Please mom please mom please I wanna stay....
(Let me stay!)

(chorus)
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...(yo)
In the middle of the street

(E)
My brothers incoharent
Moms a single parent
Who ain't caring, Staring through me like I'm transparant
Made it clear that i was just there to run her errands
Told her friends that i was the son from her last marrage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
(D)
Please sell my stepson ciggarettes so i can smoke.
(E)
One time i tried to fake a stich to get attention..
Back fired and mom sent me to school with vengence
My life is the worst thing that could ever have happened to me
I go to class and every teachers always laughing at me
Mom says "white rappers always get laughed at"
Not only that, she heard me upstairs and i can't rap
But I'm stupid 
I'll never make it average or a D+
I need to sit on my ass
And just sue people like she does
One time I got food poisening from a hotdog
Mom sued and got $2000 from Ballpark
Hey mom you got a doller?
(D)
I don't Think so
Now keep an eye on your brother,
I'm Going to bingo
(E)
But mom you said.. you were broke
(D)
who said? 
You got your ears messed up (awwww)
From that damn rap music

Gimme a call.[Intro: Frogg]
Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clapping 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is what you thought it wasn't
It beez the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G [coughing in background]
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

[Verse One: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzing, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursing at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the pudding, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus:]
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming "Fuck the World" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

[Verse Two: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezing
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against The Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shooting up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck dropping the jewel, I'm flipping the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitching while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smoking weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]
Shit, fuck everything...
Outsiders, Pace One, Young Zee.
Fuck the entire world...Verse 1:
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits,
I feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
My life's like one great big ball of shit,
If I could just put it all in to all I spit,
Instead I always try to swallow it,
Instead of staring at this wall and shit,
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit,
Can't call it shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall,
If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
This is it, last straw, that?s all, that?s it, 
I ain't dealing with another fucking politic,
I'm like a skillet bubbling, till it filters up,
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up,
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
My cup run'ith over I've done and filled it up,
The pen explodes and busts and ink spills my guts,
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
But I'm a show you, what, you gonna feel my rush,
You dont feel it then it must be to real to touch,
Build a dutch, I'm about to tear shit up,
Goosebumps, yeah I'm a make your hair sit up,
Yeah sit up, I'm a tell you who I be,
I'm a make you hate me cause you ain't me,
You wait, it ain't to late to finally see,
What you close minded fucks were to blind to see,
Whoever finds me, is gonna get a finders fee,
Out this world and ain't no one out their mind as me,
You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine,
All I need's a line but sometimes,
I dont always find the words to rhyme,
To express how i'm really feeling at that time,
Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, just sometimes,
It's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3,
This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
I'm desperate at my desk if I could just get the rest,
Of this shit off my chest, again, stuck in this slump,
Can't think of nothing, fuck I'm stumped,
But wait here comes something,
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,
Crinkle it up and throw that shit out,
I'm fizzling now thought I had figured it out,
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
But I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade,
Sionide I'll spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want,
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain?t a quitter,
I'm a sit here till I get enough,
For me to finally hit a fucking boiling point,
Put some oil in your joints,
Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed,
An MC's worst dream I make them tense they hate me,
See me and shake like a chain-link fence,
By the looks of them you would swear Jaws was coming,
By the scream of them you would swear i'm sawing someone,
By the way they running you would swear the law was coming,
It's now or never and tonight It's all or nothing,
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back,
He pinky promised, I dont think he's honest,
I be back baby I just got to beat this clock,
Fuck this clock, I'm a make them eat this watch,
Don't believe me watch, I'm a win this race,
and I'm a come back and rub my shit in your face,
Bitch, I found my niche, you gonna hear my voice,
Till you sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice,
If I gotta scream till I have half a lung,
If I have half a chance I grab it, rabbit run.(Bizarre) 
'The Rap Game'
Hip-hop 1-0-1
The hardest 9 to 5 you will ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history-book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul?
'The Rap Game' Motherfucker

(Swifty) 
I'm a disruptive nigger
You made me crazy
You should a slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily

You face me drunk of sober, you'll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop your ass
Your neck will get snapped wit bear hands, fuck music
Is he rappin' is cool but fool don't confuse it

What happens these dudes get rude and then I lose it?
I'm scandals, I blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not real and in fact 
Your fruity effect of a crack dealer

Y'all president sends me smack
Den got a mack 10 with it
So I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that
Don't mistaken me black
Or you be stankin' in back of a fuckin' Cadillac

(Eminem) 
I'ma get snuffed
'Cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the White House is whiped out
When I see that 'lil Cheany dike get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adios, goodnight

Now put that in your 'lil pipe and bite down
Think for a minute 'cause the hype has died down
That I won't go up in the oval office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down

I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Doloris Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker, duck, what the fuck, son of a bitch
Take away my gun and I'm a tuck some other shit

Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switch blade with a li'l switch to switch blades
Switch from a 6 to a 16 inch blade
Shits like a samurai sword, a sensei

Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way still till I utslay itchbay
Ucksay my ickday
'Scuse my igpay atinlay
But uckfay a igpay

I bet you rather me
Drink and drown in my own iniquity
But fuck that, I'ma rap 'til you all get sick of me
And clutch my nut sack and spit on who pick on me
I'm hittin' a rock next, fuck a dogg who sickin' me

I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know and quit playin'
If I'm broke then I'm brakin' open the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived it, that's why I speak on what I want when I write

So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I, bleed, take a piss and he stand
Ok, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no source never mean we ain't buyin' on what they say is wack

(Kuniva)
I walk in the party and just start bustin'
Right after I hear the last verse, I'm self-destruction
This liquor make me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Day and Jerome

I'm low down and shifty, quickly, called Swifty
To do a drive by on a 10-speed with "50"
You feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chucky Cheese
Well, just see, who be an unlucky G

My life style is unstable, a partyin' addict
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a matic
Coughin' ecstatic, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Popin' a tablet and guns that saw you in half

(50 Cent)
Believe me
We run this rap shit fo shizzie
Make makin' millions look easy
Every where ya turn you see me, you hear me

Believe me
For ya see my pistol in 3-D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need de
Police to help you, believe me

(Proof)
I snatch the tongue from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could say goodbye to Hollywood
Cause Proof and Shaun share nuttin' in common

The nastiest band with gats in each hand
We never bomb down to be a flash and a pan
No remorse, fuck you stature, dogg
Nuttin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all

Put your jaw on the ground with the 4 and a pound
I'm goin' out of town for the long come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter fact, we can battle with plaques

(Bizarre)
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Loraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument
Who was the largest
Now they all is dead
And I'm rollin' as a solo artist

Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well, I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was stoned in the snow with no where to go
Freezin' 20 below forced to join Bell Biv Devoe

My little girl, she shouldn't be listenin' to these lyrics
That's why I glued the headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks (hahhaha)
50, sing the hook

(Kon Artis) 
I bet you rather me
Drink and drown in my own iniquity
But fuck that, I'ma rap 'til you all get sick of me
And clutch my nut sack and spit on who pick on me
I'm hittin' a rock next, fuck a dogg who sickin' me

I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know and quit playin'
If I'm broke then I'm brakin' open the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived it, that's why I speak on what I want when I write

So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I, bleed, take a piss and he stand
Ok, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no source never mean we ain't buyin' on what they say is wack

(Kuniva)
I walk in the party and just start bustin'
Right after I hear the last verse, I'm self-destruction
This liquor make me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Day and Jerome

I'm low down and shifty, quickly, called Swifty
To do a drive by on a 10-speed with "50"
You feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chucky Cheese
Well, just see, who be an unlucky G

My life style is unstable, a partyin' addict
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a matic
Coughin' ecstatic, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Popin' a tablet and guns that saw you in half

(50 Cent)
Believe me
We run this rap shit fo shizzie
Make makin' millions look easy
Every where ya turn you see me, you hear me

Believe me
For ya see my pistol in 3-D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need de
Police to help you, believe me

(Proof)
I snatch the tongue from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could say goodbye to Hollywood
Cause Proof and Shaun share nuttin' in common

The nastiest band with gats in each hand
We never bomb down to be a flash and a pan
No remorse, fuck you stature, dogg
Nuttin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all

Put your jaw on the ground with the 4 and a pound
I'm goin' out of town for the long come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter fact, we can battle with plaques

(50 Cent)
This Rap Game

(Bizarre)
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Loraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument
Who was the largest
Now they all is dead
And I'm rollin' as a solo artist

Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well, I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was stoned in the snow with no where to go
Freezin' 20 below forced to join Bell Biv Devoe

My little girl, she shouldn't be listenin' to these lyrics
That's why I glued the headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks (hahhaha)
50, sing the hook

The rap game, hip hop 101
The hardest nine to five you'll ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul? hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up

[Swifty McVay]
I'mma disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You should've slain me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass
You'll neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not realer, in fact you're feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents since he smacked
And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac

[Eminem]
I'ma get snuffed, cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down, when the (White House) just wiped out
When I see that little (Cheney) dike get sniped out
Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight [gunshot] (AHH!)
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute cause the hype has died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword or sensai
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utslay itchbay
Ucksay my ikcday, 'scuse my igpay atinlay
But uckfay you igpay

[Chorus: 50 Cent (sung)]
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, no it ain't happening

I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

[Kon Artist]
I wouldn't wanna be drinkin', drowned in my own inequity
But fucked that I'ma rap 'til y'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
A pitt and rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I look at this, why speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
OK, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no Source never made me not buy an album when they say it was whack

[Kuniva]
I walk in that party and just start bussin' [gunshots and screaming]
Right after I hear the last verse of "Self Destruction"
This liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know +The Time+ without Morris Day and Jerome (nigga)
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
Ya feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable, a partyin' addict
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns to soften my habit

[Chorus: 50 Cent (sung)]
Believe me, we run this rap shit, for sheezy
Make makin' millions look easy
Everywhere you turn you see me, you hear me
Believe me, before you see my pistol in 3-D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need the- police to help you believe me

[Proof]
I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could "Say Goodbye to Hollywood"
Cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothin' in common
The nastiest band with gas in each hand
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
Nothin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats

This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, know it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap gameLook, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest

But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. & The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?Now it's time for our wrap up.
Let's give it everything we've got.
Ready? Begin.

Artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doing dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious fat fabulous fantastic
Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics
Gift got great global goods gone glorious
Getting godly in his game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella hype, historical
Hey holocaust hymns hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick type Brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quantum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got uh
Really raw raps, rising up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make em vanish
Why in my world would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words, weeded up on my work shift
Xerox, my X-radiation holes extra large
X-height letters, and xylophone tones
Yellow-back, yak mouth, young ones' yaws
Yesterday's lawn yard sell our yawn
Zig-Zag zombies zooming to the zenith
Zero in Zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme ZEALOTS!

Good. Can you say it faster?RBX:

Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do, cocksuckers? We glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin wires niggaz wantin me dead, wantin my head
You think it could be somethin I said? {*echoes*}

[Eminem:]
Remember me? ("I just don't give a fuck!")
Remember me? ("Yeah, fuck you too!")
Remember me? ("I'm low down and I'm shifty!")
Remember me? ("I'm Shady!")

When I go out, I'ma go out shootin
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryin to clear up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin critics
I wouldn't say "fuckin" for six minutes
(*click* Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
("Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?")
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
With M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
FUCK THAT! PBBT! You faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And re-appear in hell with a can of gas, AND a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
(What the fuck you starin at, nigga?)

Don't you remember me?!
Remember me?!!
Remember me??!
REMEMBER ME!!!!Damn girl
You drive me crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do

You make me feel things
That I never felt
You gotta be the real thing
'Cause you remind me of myselfI've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breath's Jack is a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back

It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks

'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan
To stab him in the back, knife in hand
Says the relationship's hanging by a strand

So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, despite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Susanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand, turned into night staying
He was calling so might scram, now we hug tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too

Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you

So I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew

And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (oh), my name's (oh)
Denver (oh), river run
Call me (oh), call me (oh)
River (oh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe

That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
What I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled

What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me

Oh, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river runSpoken:
Hey yo!
This song is dedicated to all the happy people.
All the happy people, who have real nice lives, and have no idea whats it like, to be broke as fuck.



I feel like I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect, but I work a sweat for this worthless check
'Bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt

Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer

Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars, becoming autograph signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small-fry's and average half-pinters

But player haters turnin' bitch like they have vagina's
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises, and broken dreams
I'm hoping things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished

And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
'Cause when we die, we know we all going the same way

'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man
Plus a luxury sedan, comfortable and roomy in a six
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics

Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
If it means I end up burning in hell, scorching in flames

If it means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems, now everybody on my blocks got 'em

I'm screaming like them two cops, when 2Pac shot 'em
Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em

And while you flaunt 'em, I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em
'Cause I never went gold off one song
I'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

Ok, I'm going to attempt to drown myself.
You can try this at home.
You can be just like me.
Mic check 1 2, we recordin'?



I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin (Ahh)

You've beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono (Oh no!)

So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more that the president does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbert (bitch)

My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (fucker)
Every girl I ever went out with is goin' les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says

Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
Jump behind wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask a for date with Lauryn Hill

Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with an orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist

I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms, then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock on the door (knock), must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed 'em both then smeared blood on the white Bronco (We did it!)

My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just an ill rhyme-sayer
That'll spray an aerosol can up at the ozone layer (*psssssssh*)

My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch (*scream*)
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn

I'm about as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there, I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (*evil laugh*)

Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high
Or I'm nuts, 'cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I

So when you see your mom with a thermometer
Shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk and with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me

I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up the just like meSpoken:

[Repeat till fade](Pace Won)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

(Az-Izz)
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

(Pace Won)
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block,
I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

(Slang Ton)
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills
Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

(Eminem)
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it (Ha)
Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years
((Pace Won) So dunn, here?)
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh? Hill?
((Pace won) There's more than one? IIIllll)
What? You want me to stop? Here?

(Young Zee)
Yeah
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yeah, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

(Axe)
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

(Pace Won)
C'mon yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

Outworld babyYo
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight

Yo, I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, your kind of tookin' back by
The whole rapper thing aren't ya?
Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?

Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop
I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya
I think ya got your OnStar button inside your car stuck

You outta gas, do you gotta flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat, I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry basket in the back
And sit up front, not asking it's a trap

You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day with no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?
Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months

She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns

Seen her back stage now here's where I come in son
Look here she comes I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun
How bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt

We're starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension

You little wench ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With sixty-six inches of extension... cord

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?
Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger then the first
Pop star icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst
Upon the scene and seen that the world was hers

She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me and made me mad at first
I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her

Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons
of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk

Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must
Creep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up.

Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney!
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent

I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you
Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
Come-on toots, give me the Valium alleyoop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke

And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you
Shoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you

I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?
Same song and dance

Same kickin' and screamin', same cryin' and sobbin'
Same song and dance
Same diggin' and pleadin', same yellin' and bleedin'
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and danceDr. Dre 
So I'm out the game huh?

Eminem 
Yo Dre, we riding?

Dr. Dre
Whatever

Eminem
Well I'm with ya, homie

Dr. Dre
OK
Let's handle the small shit

Eminem
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much
Knew too much shit, corrupt
And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick n'rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

Dr. Dre
Creep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age

Eminem
But what about Jermaine?

Dr. Dre
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what you're saying
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me, with a bunch of little mini-yous
Running round your backyard swimming pools
Over eighty million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds

Eminem
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup
If you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
We'll have you blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain
Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play Devil's advocate 

Dr. Dre
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on
I would

Eminem
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could

Dr. Dre
From the 'hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered

Eminem
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
'Cause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck; white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up
And sell a mil' or grow up to be Atilla
Go nuts and be a killer

Dr. Dre
And I'm something of a phenom'
One puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us

Eminem
C'mon!

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Dr. Dre
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alizé, partying all day
But I handle my business 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sending it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space; you invade it?
Live to regret it then you die trying to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated

Eminem
Like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood, if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone
And now I'm back
I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad 

Dr. Dre
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, and invest in something
To protect your head and neck

Eminem
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in ""The Source""?
Ain't holding my fucking breath
But I suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breath to collect a fucking check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Dr. Dre
Watch your fuckin' mouth

Timbaland
Yo this Timbaland
Tell him I said suck my dick"What's your favorite scary movie?"

(Em) Yo, Slim Shady!
(R5) Yo, Royce 5-9
(Em) Y'all wanna make a movie?
(R5) What...
(Em) We got the film right here

(Royce)
What?
Yeah I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really hafta, I really slap ya
King of Detroit who they namin the city after (what?)
Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with, content, yo who wanna start with
Experts, Bad and Evil is comin' soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin' (what?)
Leavin' all of you cats shittin kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggaz be cockin pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin the profits with you (what?)
Six percent, of y'all niggaz is just pretend
Clicks with clits, pussy niggaz stink with dicks (what?)
Niggaz act bully, and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggaz packin semi
Speak darts; yo you get paid? Rhymin about it is the sweetpart
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
Five Nine, a street nigga with deep feelin' (what?)
I keep illin, my steez willin' to keep killin' (what?)
Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that - you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder (what?) stick to my guns
Niggaz is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'ma pit bull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw (what?)
Split y'all, holla, "It's on!" Then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggaz get pissed on claimin you pissed off

Chorus: Eminem and Royce (repeat 2X)

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin, directin and starrin' in it

(Eminem)
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin
Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin' takin' advantage of like Monica Lewinksy (Leave mealone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed
Screamin to Aunt Peg (AUNT PEG!)
With three spokes stickin out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine
Damnit I like pain (Ah!)
And you should be anywhere that I might gain
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin' you back up em
If they don't like the track, fuck em
The rap struck 'em harder then gettin' hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch (Ding! Ding!)
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly (Hurry upman!)
I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest till you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
And still laugh half bent

(Em) Bad... the bad...
(R5) Uh, when the bad meets the bad... yo...
(Em) The evil
(R5) Take the evil with the evil
(Em) Put 'em together
(R5) What? Nine-nine

I don't know, man. Just feels like, we're a lot different.
Kinda feels like, I'm on a hole different page, right now.
Feels strange, but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...

I feel like I'm morphin'
Into somethin' that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect

Your self-esteem shatters as dialect, comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, so much passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her yet
You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop The Don Juan

But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like she's fuckin' with dude, she wants son

Homeboy you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do, how you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and your not, aww

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, naw
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up, till I get my respect

And I won't stop till I get enough 'cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations
Aww, that hater alarm is soundin' off, man, Obama took the bomb from my name, aww
So quit cryin' that I took your dame homie, she's my dame, aww
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy

And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-of-war with your ear, you hear it, girl come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle, that'll wait, am I losin' ya
Am I makin' you look bad, well I got news for ya, homie you're losin' her

Oh wait, you don't like when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blow out, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it punk but none of it's fuckin' with me

Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit, you think you killin' them syllables
Quit playin', these beats ain't nuttin to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe struck, she's love stricken
She's got her jaw struck from suckin' my dick, aww fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody whose as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you[Verse 1 - KXNG CROOKED:]
My name is KXNG CROOKED, I snap on you rappers often
When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across
Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'
Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we'll Willie Lynch 'em
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground
Like every bar is a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like
B-b-b-b-b a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam
Like god damn
Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam
Bam, bam your body drop, Van Damme, karate chop
The Beretta's a better competitor
Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
Killin' you and whoever in that drop top
Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot
And beaucoup, beaucoup, I'm cuckoo
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku
I'm worlds apart from you rappers
Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping
Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
When I come back, that's it
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I
When I land, you wack niggas die
And your casket is your last hit
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
Back to the hand clappin'
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson
Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan
Passin' niggas with pants saggin'
With their hand on a black Magnum
To clap him backwards
So their last words is "kcuf meht nmad saggin"
That's backwards for "fuck them damn niggas"
Buck them damn triggers
Charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers
Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
But I only like dead rappers
Compare me to the best rappers who died
And you rappers I used to look up to
I gotta cancel you now
Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex factors survive
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightin' strike
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin', I dwarf giants
I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'
I smoke philosophy, I snort science
That means I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
That's where the fire's burnin'
Try to deny music's messiah returnin'
You die and you fry in my iron furnace
I am on my get rich or die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis
Cause I am murderous

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden:]
(Joe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey)
Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends
Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs
Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS
But the bars there, put that on God, ask an atheist
And if I ain't the bomb at least I'm in the blast radius
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now
Fuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now
So it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
Face says I been stressed
I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo
Shit that bothered from the start
Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart
Yeah, just not the side that the beat is on
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready
These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
Not a how do I feel, not a how do I deal
If that's the life, nigga, then how is it real?
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers
Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears
But wait, wildest part of all of that is
They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
But fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
House Gang, Shady, I'm gone, nigga, my job is done

[Verse 3 - Yelawolf:]
Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama
My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama
Here's the back story
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills
I don't know which one's which or what it's for
Safety ain't really a habit I've formed
I still smoke to the cigarette butt
I still drink till I end up being that klutz
Clumsy, self-destructive dummy
Stumbling over my words, mumbling
I'll probably do it tonight
Leave the bar, leave the car
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
And dream about that light that leads up to the lord
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
Wake up feeling like half a human
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
For unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne the god and Lord Jamar thought it would be
Wait a minute... the lord and the god hate me
Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!
Nah...
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be
Wanna take a tour? Let's see
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion
Bucks, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers
Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call
Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
Lift kits, low riders, chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots
Dixie flags, American flags, Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass
CEO
I've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit
Guess who's coming to dinner?
André 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure
I've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just to pet and feed of course
Who rides a horse in Nashville? I might
I've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies
M-80s, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket
Moonshine, gold watches, gold rings
All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style
Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you
I've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat
All the latest CDs, mp3s, and Beats by Dre
Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check
I've got a black woman fine as she can be
FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
A 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter
I don't know where that came from
I got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work
Don't look under the tarp, sir
I'm growin' weed for my mama there
I've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley
And I did it my way
See, hip hop is what you make of it
And I'm makin' a lot of it
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out

[Verse 4 - Joell Ortiz:]
But these cyphers, I treat 'em like a war, don't want no mediators
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
People thank you, I do this for all the mean creators
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at
Now they deem me a savior
But to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, man I just really like rap
Y'all lucky, trust me
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky
With the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me
Ugly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous
I was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out who I really is
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude
I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move
No rubber groove on my shoes had to fight, so suspensions
I had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter
That's a 3 and 1, I learned that in public school too
Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece
For this Heatmakerz beat and Brother's Keeper 1
Simple mathematics, I'm addin' up to all these rap addicts
I don't like to divide dough so I multiply flow
And subtract maggots
Like a brand new Craftmatic, boy I'm back at it
Smokin' these new boys like my last habit
Dabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kick's like the last dragon
Hoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon
I just gotta laugh cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag
I'm pushin' this big ole Hearse, don't get body bagged

[Verse 5 - Royce Da 5'9":]
These new rappers be askin' me
Why I don't be hangin' out where they be hangin' out
I tell 'em, I say "Lil nigga listen here"
If I don't got no business there, I don't got no business there
See there's a difference here
You hustlin' so you can be seen
Nigga I'm grindin' so I can disappear
I don't do it like other rappers do
When it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu
We got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
If you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out
Like Chico Bean
When there's drama I don't ask no questions, I just clap in that direction
I look at this gat like it's an actual accessory
I'm anti-social so relax when you step to me
Nigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry
Your lil' stare downs won't fare well
I got a pale conscience, I'm the grey area
Last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman
Now imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song
Nigga I'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws
Or run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on
I'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit
The only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch
Glock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst
Cripple your style, your first born child'll come out
With a colostomy bag as the afterbirth
I don't give a fuck
Nigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z
Stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest
Lookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby
Jump in the 4 door Mercedes with a .44 listenin' to JoJo and K-Ci
Drinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses
Maybe, this ebola for rabies
That's it, just livin' the rapper life
Banana clip in the air, lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight
MACs, I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin' up
I got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner
Cause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is
I'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me
Mack magnet, attractin' enormous green
Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack
Cause this bitch is that war machine
Life of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft
Drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk
We both got marketing plans
Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before
Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
And then go invest into a grocery store
Rolled up with the Smith & Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now
I do numbers, I turn you and your crew into two plumbers
Translation, get your shit together and pipe down
Fuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit
I'll shoot you and your sis if you insist
I got my eyes on the sparrow
Silencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel
And he doin' this

[Verse 6 - Eminem:]
(My name is Marshall
I'm repping that motherfucking Motor City, bitch)
I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet
Began to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet
Made shit as ill as it can get went in depth
Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
I'm already covered in sweat and I wasn't even ready to come in yet
AHH, let me set this drink down
Beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
Probably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile
And "Rap God" was a freestyle
Off the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch
And I'm freestyling now
I need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow
It's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul
Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal
I need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio
And went to South Beach with his talents
Scream "fuck you" on the way out and wink with a smile
This whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground
But right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out
Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
What the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters
Bunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
One swing and you're crowned
Knocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now
You think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou
Bitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
Reach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around
Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
And heave a child in a sink hole on Cinco De Mayo
When I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
Mardi Gras beads in a towel
I just made that up
I don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual
But I'll show you a Mexican stand off
Between just these two amigos
Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
But I sure as fuck think I know how read body English, no doubt
Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically
The fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?
Royce, he came up in the shit with me
Never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me
Let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
Of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery
Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
So what in the fuck is a list to me?
I'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em
Heck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em
Ain't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out
But I could put a chain around my second album
And wear it as a neck medallion
Became a millionaire, went downhill from there
Became civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware
Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career
The fuck am I gonna do until then? This job is too fulfilling
Two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
And a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville
Into some children at the food pavilion and Build-A-Bear
Warrior's mind, I’m pro-hydrocodone euphoria
In the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring
I'm pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore I go four wheeler riding
Gory and violent and horrifying
You surely won't find no one more appalling
Than I am with this retaliatorial rhyming for Gloria Steinem
But I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
I usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am
I guess I must've threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam
When I said I could use the sample cause you's a tramp
But look how you react to this trigger like
When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam
You're playing right in Lex Luthor's hand
It's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan
But fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan
I'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band
Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed
In his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't
Since honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try
Try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify
As a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride
And say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize
I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines
And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
Then I'm like dollar signs
But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
Is more of a knockout than Janay Rice
Play nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right
In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight
In plain sight of the elevator surveillance
Til her head is banged on the railing
Then celebrate with the Ravens
Never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants
I'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape
The aggression, rage and the anger
Cause they restraints on the ankles
Heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
This ain't enough to contain it
But I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on
Stage in a fucking negligée everyday and Liz Claiborne
Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson
Wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say
Cause makeup ain't gonna cover
That eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
Peppersprayed with your face cut
Made my bank like a lay up
Off these effing skanks on the way up
Oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent
It's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches
Yes, I said seven, I measured it
Seven inches from the floor
While I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
At the Sheradon when I'm stretching it
Bitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
So if she's hesitant to get the hint
I'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with
Hella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
Existential detriments to a lesbian devil
In the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
That separatists like a Chechnian rebel
Impressionist with a pencil
A pessimist, with his lips pressed against
The edge of this Red Bull
Pedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
SHADYXV as perplexing as
The last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse
When I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
When I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears
And these little Disney queers
Who use chicks for beards?
Just made that up too...
Oh and the Shady 2.0
We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls
Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
The flows lose you as usual, so juvenile
2 year old when I go to the studio
It's only music but don't be foolish though
You don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
In my homie's Buick
Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it
When I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do
And I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart
In one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it
You couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
The day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it
Rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip
With the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women
I'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
They tryna get rid of me gadzooks
But I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag
Of the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through
And if I catch you doing anything
Hindering or prohibiting that after I give me that
Tattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally
Pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!

Fuck it

Got it somewhere in there probablyEminem
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that ass on the flow
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up

Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Nate Dogg
2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat

3 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock

Get ya ass off the wall with your 2 left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We about to have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day, she be givin' it up

Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Eminem
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow, and I'll finish

Yeah me and Nate D-O-double G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party

Nate Dogg
Have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Eminem
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

'Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

We about to have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead, shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be givin' it up

Eminem
There she goes, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control

Come on, I ain't leavin' without you, bitch, come on with me
And my boy and this boy and this boy and his girl... Nate Dogg[Eminem]
Slim Shady
Asshole

[Royce]
Any nigga wit guns, we got guns too
More heated, ready to outgun you

You was around, you know the outcome too
Let's play, lemme show you what Game is
Heartbreak, I'm showin' you what pain is

Can't get none, but you know I love you girl

[Chorus:]

[Royce]
She the one that wanna ride hot whips, huh
Same one that ain't really got shit, huh
She want her hair done, then get her nails done
Go to Fifth Ave, just to shop for Chanel, huh

[Eminem]
She the one that ain't really got shit, huh
The little bitch that really aint got tits, huh
Fuckin slut with a chest enhanced,
Who titty-dances to pay for her breast implants

[Eminem]
Anybody wit knives, we got knives too
More sharp, and ready to outslice you
About 5 dudes deep who outsize you
Who wanna see insides comin outside you
Get me drunk, and I'll drink anything you can think
Wattup Miss. Bitch
(Yo what's up with the ring, you married?)
Shit, I'm still mingling, bitch
I just wanted to scream, this is the only finger that's it
Wattup with you, you married?
(Naww, I'm divorced)
Of course you are, you little fuckin trailer park whore
(Trailer? I don't live in no trailer. I live in a mobilization unit, for your information)
Bitch, I got a dick, wanna fuck?
Hold still, swallow this birth control pill, slut
Fuck, pump so much cum in your stomach that when I pull out
A years and a half old potty-trained baby falls out
And I ain't stayin to pay no child support
Are you playin? Be a man- bitch what you sayin?
You tryin to pull some bullshit, while I got one arm free
You want me to make this half-nelson a full?

[Chorus:]

[Royce]
Wattup boo, this is for you and your girlfriend
You bank-head, up in Detroit we Earl Flynt
Assholes get guns and flashed those
Never ever go to Detroit, we blast those

[Eminem]
Hi, my name is...

[Royce]
Royce
I'm the king
Gimme money, gimme jewels, everything
Ayyo, you with the long hair, is it yours?
I guess so, got a reciept- paid for
Got anymore lipstick? I'm sick of red
Get a perm, you nappy head, you chicken head
I know you ghetto, I ain't trying to take the ghetto out
Things about you to tell about, mellow out
I'm the one that be makin the clubs say "What"
Gettin love, and making the club say "What"
Some of you cats, hate on the low and got sick
Any sauce that got hits, not this

[Chorus]

[Project Paki]
Any nigga wit guts, we got guts too
More than crazy, only want to outdo you
Damn, too late, we going after you
Go get more niggaz, you gonna need more than two

Militainment- we soldiers y'all
Me, Slim, and Royce got you cornered y'all
The only niggaz you see on World's Wildest Police Chases
Niggaz that go wild only during court cases
Bitches go wild when they see us cum on they faces
We never discriminate, we fuck all races
She the one that I got love for
Money she won't get, I assure
She the one that think she hot
Damn, have you seen her, she is hot
High maintanence- that's her style
God I can't her out my mind, when she smile
But ain't no need to worry bout nothin
I got ten girls like her, I ain't frontin
The only thing i buy is some good clothes for her, cuz them shit is tacky
Royce got me on this, remember the name- Project Paki
so yo

[Chorus]

[Royce]
You tramp
Why you still listenin?
Don't you see, I'm dissing you
Fade me out, why would you ever play me out?
I'm cool
What do yall want from me?

(Repeat till fade)These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On)
(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it
And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted

That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs

Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes

That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you awayThese ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair, and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing

To see him walking around with his, headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his fuckin' dad walkin' out

'Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap

He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he, socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go

(Chorus from Aerosmith's Dream On)
(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing it!)
For the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me, off of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B

It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

(Come on!) Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!)
For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!)
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods, and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is, hear about us totin' pistols

Yeah, haha, you feel that baby?
Yeah I feel it too, damn.
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together.
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?

I'm the American dream, I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with the *rchick-rchick-chicka-chick*
I can't call it, same shit different toilet
Oh ya, got a nice ass darlin'

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend
Lemme tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry, if you slam my Mercedes door again

Now, it all started with my father
I musta got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin' stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage wit me, baby I make a promise

There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs and his arms
I'm a superstar girl, I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may want to find something more stable
I told you I ain't foolin from the gate, this ain't the first day of April

But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you
Learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggie bear and all the kissy face please

Initiate phase three, missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady

I told you I'm shady, you didn't listen now did ya
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally startin' to get the picture, I'm just

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

But in the evenin' I gotta go
*Chicka-chicka*
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh oh oh

I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweatin'
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya

Girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feelin' of something that's so organic
You can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get the cam 'cordin', damn shortie

I told you this is bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back and throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded, you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup

So stop at the store and pick a pint up
Let's get the Pineapple Schnapps goin', no one will knock 'cause I'ma hang a sign up
Sayin' don't disturb, shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

And you ain't gonna want to fuck nobody else again

Spoken Outro
Ha
Dr. Dre
2010
Lightyears ahead o' you
Haha
Woo!Pick up the god dang phone

Bitch where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio
Bitch what'd you do, screw Dre?
You went there looking for me?
Ooh, that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg

You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew Drake
Que Lupe? You want to lose two legs
You try to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"Ok yeeah, I’m coo-coo, hey?" Well, screw you

And I’d be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? Dre, Drake, Lupe? Ooh touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one
True BlueAce but you ain't

And I can see you and you make that little boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking Bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

My life will be so much better if you just dropped dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brim
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause I told 'em
I'm only driving drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink

I'm back on my fuck hoes but a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement
And I'm channeling my anger through every single station it's on

'Cause a woman broke my hea-art, I say hea-art
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you a-are?
Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet

But I'll never say the L-word again
I la-la-la-la lesbian, aah
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life's be so much better if you just

My life will be so much better if you just dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)

'Cause you told me you love me, forever
Bitch, that was a lie
I never wanted someone to die
So bad in my fucking life
But fuck it, there's other fish in the sea

And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night
Bitch on a scale of 1 to 10, shit
I must be the holy grailer
Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (great)

I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer
These bitches tryna get atached with the failer
And latch him to the tail of my bumper to scratch them with the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched

Yeah, I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bitch

That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls, it's foul
But my dick's on strike so all that love shit is null and void
Bitch I'm a droid, I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed

Oi oi oi man oh man you boy boy boys
Getting sick at these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink, you fucking pigs
All you good boys doink doink doink

I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take em all out I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack
And just drop dead and I'mma throw a fucking party after this 'cause

My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (I hate you)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)

I'm just playing bitch, you know I love youWe touch, I feel a rush, we clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust

Don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' hoes

Blood sucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over

I got a hole in my heart, like some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions ho it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's

Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you, must have been fate

But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me, if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms

Drop to my knees and I'm pleading, I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
Till I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick

Ain't no possible reason I could think of
To let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star, 'cause I'm a

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you, without youEminem
If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say 
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way 
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one 
Tryna pick myself up where I started from 

Obie Trice 
I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control 
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole 
You should know between us we was like mates to soul 
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes

You was more or so the chalant type, I chose 
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose 
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows 
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll

So who's responsible when you get excited, explode 
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold 
But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate 
We established this way before we became mates 

So whats required is that you chill with all that fire 
Get your desire when I retire 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Eminem
I used to say I never met a girl like you before 
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers

Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for 
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore 
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours 
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls

If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad 
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off 
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off 
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on

You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue 
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me 
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly 
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me

It's true that I got shot in the heart 
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are 
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see 
Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach

Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat 
Before you make a decision that's life altering 
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave 
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right, 'cause you just crossed the line 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Stat Quo 
Yeah right, bitch. Spend some time on my dick.

In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch 
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch 
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant 
Even held your hand in public

We sufferin' because of this 
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit 
Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick 
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit 
Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss

We started off closer than close 
But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth 
And the final result, back in that same boat 
I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO! 

50 Cent
Em introduced us, "50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50" 
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me 
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips 
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick

We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind

She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, now how many times have I heard that shit?

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine 
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line 
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mineEminem
If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say 
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way 
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one 
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

It feels so good to be back
Ladies and gentleman
Introducing the new and
Improved you know who

Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a maltese, I'm a pitbull off his leash
All this peace-talk can cease

All these people i had to leave in limbo
I'm back now I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Cannabitch, don't want no beef with slim, no

Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From seance to seance

So come on now, let's all get on now
Doh si doh now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Dont be scerrrd, 'cause therrr ain't nuttin' to werrr 'bout
Let your hair down, square dance with me

Let your hair down, square dance with me

Let your hair down to the track, Yeh, kick on back (boo)
The boogie-monster of rap, yeh, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the senates face in and push this generation

Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
You might not like This white hot light 
that im under no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned

Oh no, I won't leave won't go nowhere
Doh-si-doh oh! yo! ho! hello there
Oh yeh! don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there

Yeh you laugh till your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
When you're at band camp thinkin' the crap cant happen
Till you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrappin'

Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' amtracks crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'

To join the army, or what you'll do for their navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me

Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady!
My views ain't changed still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me

So come on now, let's all get on now
Doh si doh now, we gon' have a good ol' time

Dont be scerrrd, 'cause therrr ain't nuttin' to werrr 'bout
Let your hair down, square dance with me

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me, shoot me

Physcotic hypnotic product I got the antibotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk alot of cum-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta

Keep movin' there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and hennesey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies

On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry like a fucking younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free

Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny I have the money 
To have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I pass bluffing, pass the K-Y 
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass fucking

So come on now, let's all get on now

Cana-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Canada-Bis dont want no parts o' me

Yeeeeha!My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie

I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew

That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No"
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her

I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven

But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together, too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans:
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass!
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air Tonight"?

About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk

But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
How am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!

I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!
Damn...Yo, follow me, come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world, so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
(Stay wide awake) 

Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark it's winter in December
I see my target put my car in park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend ta befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, hi there girl you mighta'
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda' girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya

I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian yeah now let's see her have triplets then I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-
-hyde and cyanide girl, you can try and hide you can try to scream louder

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin', I'd rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull pull another one out uh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
(Stay wide awake) 

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide and seek like Jason, I'm so hungry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me
Pull the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound 'sleep

Who's wakin' me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin' me she tries to scream somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me he's bitin' me he's laughing like it's funny
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escaping me no dice you see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but its alright with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

Better try ta stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how 'bout now are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
Must have just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there

Prowler there's no one fouler, bound ya that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess look how ya cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt, beddy bye-bye beddy bye-bye it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matta'
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water

Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun ta act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1 someone's comin' in from the back

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya, girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
(Stay wide awake) But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go, God only knows

(Steve)This album's never coming out
(Eminem)Steve, you've only heard one song
(Steve)Fuck you! Get the fuck outta here! NOW

As heard on The Eminem Show

*Door knocks*

Steve Berman:
It's ridiculous, I can't believe it, what?
Hold on a minute
Em...

Eminem:
Whuddup?

Steve Berman:
Dre, I'll call you back

Eminem:
What now?

Steve Berman:
I don't even know where to start

Eminem:
Okay

Steve Berman:
I got the album from upstairs

Eminem:
And?

Steve Berman:
And this is by far the most...

*Gun shoots*

Steve Berman:
...incredible thing I've ever heard...

As heard on Relapse

(Ring Ring)
Secretary: Mr.Berman?
Steve: What?
Secretary: We have Eminem here to see you
Steve: About fuckin' time. Send him in
(Door opens)
Eminem: Steve! Good to see you man. Um,hey I jus
Steve: Well, look who decided to show his face! I hope you've had fun in the last four years
Em: Look man, I apologize again for
Steve: For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
Eminem: Again, it was a mistake. It was a terrible mista--- are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
Steve: And then you go and do, what, Hide out? Stay in Detroit for almost 5 years while the music industry melts the fuck down? Do you know how many people lost their jobs because of your fucking vacation?
Eminem: Well, that's actually why I'm here, I was gonna put out some new music and I wanted to play it for you and get your opinion
Steve: Do I REALLY need to hear it? Let me guess: Another album about "poor me, I'm so famous it has ruined my rich little life and I'm such a tortured artist let me make music about it and my tragic love life." Am I on to something here?
Eminem: C'mon, man! It's not like that
Steve: You know what? Just hand the fucking thing over! I'm done talking to you! Think you can just come and go as you please, big selfish superstar
Eminem: Steve, I had a drug problem
Steve: "Oh, poor me! I had a drug problem!" Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town? You know what?
(Cocks gun, Em: "Woah!")
Just lay this shit down on my desk and get the fuck out
Eminem: Woah Woah, Jesus Christ man, alright alright, here, fine...
Steve: What's this shit?! TWO cds?
Eminem: That's what I've been trying to tell you, man. It's two albums
Steve: Just get out! Get the fuck out
Eminem: Alright, man. See you laterPsst, hey, listen

I love my job
It makes me feel like, superman
Can you fly, I can, wanna see

I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you

My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics constantly took out of context

Failure to communicate with congress
Has, been a problem for the longest I guess
But, maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest

Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark

There's a ray
There's a light
There's a hope
There's a spark

But when planets collide
They'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide
To set their differences aside

And this is why
Only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead
And feel the vibe because

I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you

My, music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it, I get sick of trying to explain it

See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
'Cause I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on

Constantly movin', constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams

I'll be here when y'all are gone rebuilding
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy, probably millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then cause

I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain you

My, lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an
Alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate

I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, Slim you're great
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain

'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced, and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain

But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts, but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but

I'm only entertaining you, my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me, entertain youSpoken
(Mmmhh)
You high baby? (Yeah)
Yeah? (Ha ha ha. Talk to me.)
You want me to tell you somethin'? (Uh huh)
I know what you wanna hear



'Cause I know you want me baby
I think I want you, too
(I think I love you baby)
I think I love you, too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you, too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy)
Bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down

In a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick

Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face

I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, copin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice to buy you ice?
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife?
What you Mariah, fly through twice?

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what
That's about as far as your buddy goes

We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then

You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie

But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that fuckin' runway hoe

(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy)
Bitch, you make me hurl

First thing you say

I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me)

Ooh yeah girl run that game
(Haily Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot in Pieces", uhh that's great)

First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool

There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good Lordy-wody you must be
Gone off that quarter bottle

You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands

Put Anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Bizzare:

from tha Outsidaz
Bam Bam Bam!
Dirty Dozen
Outsidaz
Taking the whole world with me
2 blunts and I'm bringing ya girl with me

Pacewon:
I'm high like Redman
trippin' with a tab of acid in my head band
the names Pacewon I'll kick that ass quickly
when I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
four alarms, pigs try to get me
when I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down)
take it with me
take it with me
the whole world with me
I'll be hittin you with
rude shit
I be rollin' like crews with new whips
call it stupid
but I've mastered
the fantastic
ghetto bastard
more rap style to kick that ass with
rough as brillo
nympho
spreadin like info
more than the Jacksons got kinfolk
ya crew not strong
they stink like ya mother's feet
when she walk in shoes with no socks on
light as popcorn
me
disciplinin' fresh emcees that you'd be scared to rock for

I'm low down and I'm shifty
when I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
most emcees get slapped cause they sissy
when I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

Eminem:
I'm in a soundproof
booth without a roof
drunk off 180 proof
vodka with docter Ruth
we in the vocal room inhalin magic markers
sitting the dark lightin our blunts with sparklers
we got my man Pacewon behind the board
because we tied the engineer without ripcords
Bizzares in tha lobby with the Beatles
smokin bowls
pokin holes in his veins with derty needles
we get all doped up from poppin uppers
and run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers
smokin homegrown drugs
that's why you can barely tell what the fuck we're saying like Bone Thugs
hittin blunts till my lungs get too much smoke
and take one more short toke
before I snort coke
shit, I been doin lines all day
my minds all played from smelling Pine Sol spray
What, no hold up hold up hold up
smokin laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll up
my lungs are all swol up
about to bust open
I'm just hopin
I don't die from snortin crushed Motrin

I need drugs, somebody fix me
when I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
12 bluntz plus I'm bringin ya girl with me
when I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
I'm not comin' back, so don't send no one to get me
when I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Fuck that, gimmee all my shit free
when I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

Bizzare:
Whack emcees there's a new sheriff in town
put ya guns down and die with an ill frown!
Tha Outsidaz doin uppas and downas
clowners
even massa scared to hang around us
I'm a slob that don't have job
peep through your window steal the cook from ya mom
we just starters
ya'll niggas hit the bitches
smackin more hos than Jo Jackson has felony conviction
clouds of mushrooms I just can't see
Pull me out tha bathroom I'm bout to OD!
Nasty, dirty some say I'm filthy
everytime I drop a rap I'm a be like
MMMRRRRPHHH!
crazy high, have no fear
eat the pussy of a girl with burning diarhea
I'm ready to box so the bell go ding ding
My crew's more stupid and whack than Zazu from Lion King
who's the big guy
high off chocolate tye
if you disrespect me you'll lyrically die

somebody hide me, somebody get me
when I die I take the whole world with me
I'm bout to do your girl named Cindy
when I die I take the whole world with me
Your grandma said I give as good as cleany
when I die I take the whole world with me

(outro)
You know my flos so ill
Emcees on the micrphone
spittin' verbal skillsIt feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

(Eminem)
I'm that guy man, shove a dime up in my hind end,
And crush it with my butt muscles as I cut vocals,
Slut poke holes in your shirt jump in mud puddles,
While I stomp mud holes in your ass girl lets cuddle,
Blood curdling on your girdle whatll,
I do for my next trick I'm feeling wonderful,
I think I might just do something a little less subtle,
Shove a fucking Tonka truck up a little kids butt hole,
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash Ambassador,
Of the Valentines Day massacre slash assassin,
I slash her in ass with an icicle and leave her in a blood bath while I,
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her,
In my Spider-Man mask just imagine,
The fun I can have with a strap on,
Stick up a Kim Kardashians ass,
And make the bitch run a triathlon,
Are those pistachios? Damn id like to have some,
Laying on the patio man rolling a fat one,
Shady drop the magic marker put the cap on,
Goddamn man are you that much of an asshole.

It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

(Eminem)
I'm like Houdini,
Tuck my teeny, eenie, weenie between each,
One of my thighs and make it disappear like Houdini.
Make this shit disappear like Tara Ried in a bikini,
Believe me homie you don't know the meaning of a meanie.
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter,
I'm tryna maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot, don't move or ya,
Might get it stuck up so fuckin' far up in your uvula,
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to your gloutius.
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio,
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Weenier's smothered in peanut butter,
Pudding on the tube of your eye shadow,
And that'd look nice, you shoulda seen it mother.
I think I put a piece of art on my Visa card,
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a cuisinart,
And mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's, with McDonald's,
Jump in her lap and watch the Sopranos.

It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

(Eminem)
Shady what're ya doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat and hide a clue in the back room,
And assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room,
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon,
Skewin' a rat, a cat, screwin' a baboon.
You shouldn't ask, "What is he doin' with that broom?".
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds,
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh.
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin,
By the hair and make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'.
Shady why do you gotta pick on the lady for,
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you and baby-tard?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed,
Kelly Pickler hid my juicebox under my bassinet,
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed,
Do you like graffiti dike? Well I can pee-pee and write your name.

(Eminem)
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But it's all right, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance.
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

Fine... Nobody wants to play with me? Fuck you then... Bitch... Guys are always mean to me anyways... All they do is rub gum in my hair and stuff... You guys are going to make me sad... I'm crying... I'm gunna tell my mom... MOMMMMMMMM...Hey yo
Before I start this song, man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
Snd bearing with me over these last couple of years
Ehile I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy
Woah, woah, woah, woah

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne

It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then could have got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic

Thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill tryin' to talk myself into it

Are you stupid, you gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punch line even
You're lyin' to yourself, your slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health
Is declining with your self-esteem, your crying out for help

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathin' and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echos in this hall though (oh-oh-whoa)

But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado

But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the break, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's

But instead of feelin' sorry for yourself, do somethin' bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby
Quit worryin' about what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that im not the only one

So I picked myself off the ground and fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard, I bounced twice, suffice this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushin' em out

I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally

Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin' up, oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over, homos

I'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep your head up
T.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' em, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there, it feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my stuggle and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me, yeah, I guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane, am I the one whose crazy

So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So there it is, damn
It feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Hey yo, and to anybody that I thought about going at
It was never nothin' personal; it was jus' some shit I was going through
And to everybody else... I'm back, heh(feat. Green Lantern)

[Green Lantern:]
Okay, it's about that time again

[Eminem:]
Green Lantern!

[Green Lantern:]
That's right

[Eminem:]
G-G-G-G-unnii [burp]Shit..
Haha
(shady)
We back! Invasion, Part 2
The conspiracy

Cause we ain't gunna never stop, you just keep wastin' you energy on us 
You should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us cause we ain't fuckin' with you 
And it must be fuckin' with you so much you must be goin' out your mind (mind)

[Verse 1:]
They say i'm a damn way from my entire empire crumbilin'
Speak up your mumbillin'
What the fuck are you so (be,be,be,be,k,k,k,k) okay baby this is Shady I know you is a lil baby and wish we would just go away and we may weeble wobble but we don't fall down like J master J's two turn tables(R.I.P.)our label is just too stable
Your magazine is so mutha fuckin' thin you usin' staples to hold it together 
It's turnin' back into a news paper
And y'all got someting for my ass every issue
Thank you cause I keep runin outta fuckin' tissue
And not to diss you but god I was sick of lookin' at you
Atleast I can know when nikes' got a new tennis shoe
But I guess no g'news is always good g'news 
Movin' on to big, better things (Chickachickacheureh)
50's blowin' up 
Missy keeps on throwin' up
What the fuck is goin' on?
Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady wait a minute baby leave the world alone just go up there and be humble and take them another time
Bush has just declared the World a fuckin' war zone
Meanwhile we got a war goin' on of our own at home
My fuckin' minds blown, tryin' to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhine stones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy ain't that right whoooaaaa
Wait a minute i'm ramblin', back to the matter at hand it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presly the selfish MC back to ruin rap and destroy the industry 
Single handedly and oh man did we yeah me an 50, obie me and Twizzy, and Nelly, and Missy, and Jigga god damn it's all a plan devised by the man
It's a conspiracy again fake shit and anybody who can't make hits or dope shit lyrically
So fuck what ya hurd or what you read about
We ain't ruinin' rap baby we just tryna' weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to Roc The Mic right!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
Cause your magazine is over in less than six months 
Hahah, Shady records, still aftermath
And don't think we can hear you muthafuckas talking, cause we can't, we don't hear y'all, so we're just gunna sit back for the rest of our lives while you ride our dicks.And everyone should get along

Eminem impersonating Mr. Mackey & Eric Cartman :
Okay children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that (Shut up)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia (He's got AIDS)
Good luck Mr. Shady



Hi there, little boys and girls (Fuck you)
Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels

But first I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi Bob (Hi Bob), Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
He don't got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot

And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block

And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge
Till one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job
When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk

But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uh
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to give Bob a doctor

Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found her
And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner

And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you

Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem):
See children, drugs are bad (come on)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (raise your hand)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)
And there's really nothing else to say (sing along)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay



My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)
Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world

If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back

Meet Zach, 21 years old
After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it

Suddenly, he starts to convulse, and his pulse
Goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes roll back in his skull
His back arches up, looks like the McDonalds arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'

And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him."
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their money

Meanwhile Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga
And that's the story of Zach: the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you

Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem):
See children, drugs are bad (that's right)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)

So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
And there's really nothing else to say (Uh huh)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay



And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out wipe if off bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it (Yum yum)

And then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)
Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair

"Mr. Shady, what's a g-string?", it's yarn Clair
Women stick them up their behinds, go out and wear 'em
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops did I say magic mushrooms, I meant fungus

Your tongue gets, all swole up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at

But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't drugs and do exactly as I don't, because I'm bad for you

Mr. Mackey impersonation (Eminem):
See children, drugs are bad (uh huh)
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down)
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can ask)
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (and she will)

So kids say no to drugs (say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
And there's really nothing else to say (that's right)
Drugs are just bad, m'kay

Eminem impersonating Mr. Mackey & Eric Cartman :
Come on children, clap along (Shut up!)
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!...Ewww, ah!)
(So, fucked up, right now.)(Eminem)
I'm gonna kill this bitch.
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm going to fucking jail,
'Cause I'm gonna kill this bitch

(Screaming & Running)May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though"

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose

"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe"

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' "I don't give a fuck"
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up[Eminem]
May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here..

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe"

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' "I don't give a fuck"
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up(feat. 50 Cent) 

[Intro - Eminem] 

&lt;I&gt;[Beatboxing]  Yeah, we should do something like that...

&lt;I&gt;[Chorus - 50 Cent] 

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!

&lt;I&gt;[Verse 1 - Eminem] 

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex [reversed] , a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass

&lt;I&gt;[Verse 2 - 50 Cent] 

Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, to clean parts, to shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tell you're ass apart!
A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows
You rocking wit the kid to spit sicker sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down
I smile through summan' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

&lt;I&gt;[Hook - 50 Cent (Eminem)]

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head, funky funk up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, (It's the Re-Up!)
Shady, Shady...[Chorus 1]
It's (it's) be (be) cause (cause) of (of)
these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do
Be.. cause.. of..
these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do

[Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]
It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit
And my friend came in he was like, "Yo! Yo! Em! Em!
You puttin that shit up your nose again?"
And I was like, "Naw" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n shit
Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor
It's crazy

[Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]
It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do

[Eminem]
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it
It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon)
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

[Bizarre]
Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!)
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me
(huh?) 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
that I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Cussin out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (UNNNNGGGHHH!)
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smokin a half a pound
Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down

[Chorus 1]

[Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]
It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And - just was fuckin wasted every night, like
wakin up the next morning like - where the..
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on
you see what I'm sayin? I was just like, out of control

[Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]

[Swifty McVay]
These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister
Laughin with a chromed out caliber (hahahahaha)
The weed that I'm sellin this (?) look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashin it, after framin a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Crackin capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm lookin like a extra on "Night of the Living Dead"
until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester

[Proof]
Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (ohhhhhh)
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms
(Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
while D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf at my stomach linin, drown in my vomit

[Chorus 1 - 2.5X]

[Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]
Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?
Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin
when you're out in the public eye and shit
they're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
"Eminem dies from, drug overdose" - youknowhatI'msayin? And
And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin?
They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it
So do they..

[Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1 - 2x]Aight, man, whatever...

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses."

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I amLife by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
Put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises, to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
In the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my wordI'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer (?)
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And aint shit changed
But kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
That smashed into your Honda Accord
With a 4 door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin an accapella
And choppin' a fella
To mozarella
Worse than a hellacopta propella
Got you locked in the cella
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia
While I'm standin next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins
Feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
It's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit (?)
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombas (?)
We blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I aint making no more threats
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack (?) 
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. SureYo left, yo left 
Yo left, right, left 
Yo left, yo left 
Yo left, right, left 
Yo left, yo left 
Yo left, right, left 
Yo left, yo left 
Yo left, right, left

Eminem
Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak. 
When you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up. 
But you gotta search within you. 
Gotta find that inner strength and just pull that shit outta you and get that motivation, to not give up and not be a quitter. 
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps as long as you feel 'em. 
Till the day that I drop You'll never say that I'm not killin' em. 
'Cause when I'm not, then I'ma stop pinnin' em 
And I am not hip hop, and I'm just not Eminem. 
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sinnin 
Women are caught in webs spin'em and hock venom 
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop 
Amoxicillin's just not real enough. 
The criminal cop killin' hip hop villain a minimal swap 
To cop millions of Pac listeners. 
You're coming with me, feel it or not 
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of god lives in us. 
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock 
Is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up? 
Fa shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot listen up. 
You bizzles forgot, slizzle does not give a fuck.

Music is like magic. There's a certain feeling you get 
When you're real and you spit and people are feelin' your shit. 
This is your moment and every single minute you spend 
Trynna hold on to it, cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, trynna get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's in it's end
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in 
It goes Reggie, Jay Z, Tupac and Biggie 
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurrupt, Nas and then me. 
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lotta envy. 
So when I'm not put in this list, the shit does not offend me. 
That's why you see me walkin' 'round like nothing's bothering me. 
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me. 
You hate it but you know respect you gotta give me. 
The press' wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me!

Eminem
Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word 
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack, I'm launchin' at them
The track is on some battling rap, who wants some static
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim Mathers
A plaque and platinum status is rad cause I'm not the raddest, so

The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs) 
Give out from underneath me. 

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out 
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 
Till the smoke clears out  - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse 

Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs) 
Give out from underneath me.

Eminem
I, I will not fall. 
I will stand tall. 
Feels like no one can beat me.[Eminem]
Yo blast me off, Tim, blast me off, son
Blastin' off right now son

PART ONE

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods, the MC
With the Christopher Reeve beef
We started out on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood
I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O
I'm like hello to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like Iron Mike 'cause I bite earlobes

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart till I die
Even after I’m all gone and my ashes fried
Went from an ashy guy class clown as high
To a grown ass man stacking pa-per
Runyon Ave.'s the clique , D12's the game
We've been spitting this (shit)
Since we were little bébés
Gaga goo goo nana, nadi do do never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot and leave a nigga's face  lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock-eyed it
When I bust it out off in the crowd, you start diving
Greg Louganis went over the bar I ain't lying
Hot Iron lethals not defying a soldier
Runyon Ave. soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than (a nigga) understand the struggle
Apply the street-muscle we've been had to hustle
We've been had to hustle, we've been had to muscle
Apply the street hustle, we've been had to hustle

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight, aight
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin Gratiot til I damn near crash the car
Tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off
Over the bridge into oncoming traffic
Caused a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all
Hopped up holding an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kickin' fire out your ass you little bastard
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdrawal
Dick so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of Plastic Man with a drastic force
And went spastic, put my penis on classic sports

PART TWO

[Eminem]
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished, huffing the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothing because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares making the hairs
All on the back of your neck stand
Like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yah, Angela so I command you to start dancing
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, ya gangsta, my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facing a task greater, he's chasing your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure, a full dose of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and Codeine
I was only supposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink frozen
Myself, self-loathing, 'cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosey
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodelling
Rosey, won't you come out to play
A nuisance, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stirred em
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies 'cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events and then he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured em into the building and killed em
Buried em in the mulch and mildew and he will
Do what he feels and still can spin
Straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol - three pills, the Real Slim
Shady's entered the building
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and
Tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's
Will get fricasseed on the grill then

PART THREE

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You wanna start with the hook first
You wanna start with the...oh
I have no idea what I'm doing, I have no idea what I'm doing, but
Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
Live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this uh
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me? I disa-
-ppeared, I was hiding in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and a jump from my skin gushing
Nails into my face that I been pushing
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a
Sucker like a vice grip, my pen put you
In the slaughterhouse 'cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brains on
Hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
I got it figured out now nigga, see
My mind's right, money right
Can't nobody stoppin' how I get it
In hindsight I never shoulda left where  I was livin'
I probably wouldn't be getting pressed by all these women
But then again I wouldn't 'a met the ones that I was diggin'
So now I like to look and talk a lot like
She like Lil Kim and Kim and Serena Williams
Just like my [ ] I'm a regular Charles Dickens
Bitch call me talking about she pregnant
She crazy so I [ ] that ho and left baby
I won't never trust her no shit
Even if she specialize in mouth massaging my testicles
I never trust her, a ho, I, even on the first date
She's basically getting her mouth raped
Then turn around and ask me for a kiss
"No bitch I'm straight"
I've never really been concerned with how my own dick taste

I think I'm about slip on my swag juice, swag juice
I think I'm about to slip on your swag juice

[Eminem]

Oh no! Don't slip on your swag juice!

[Mr. Porter]

Yeah, yeah, I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice!

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
So here's a smidge and a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to figit with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice.  Aright

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there sister
Bound to get you dizzy 'cause he gets as busy as a
Bee baby you could throw a Frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he, he's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick witcha
I want the kiss before I blow this bitch to smitha-
Reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
Ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turn tables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
We'll wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's six o-
Clock in the morning unless you want to get some dessert

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidge and a midget to get your Bridgets, digit
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I said, here's a smidge and a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag, my swag juice

[Epilogue: Eminem]
Ayo, just so everybody knows, that was a hook we made on the way to the radio station and we were trying to get it right;
So we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever;
But, this is what we were trying to like work out before we came here. Especially for Westwood, man! ESPECIALLY for you homie![Eminem and Hailie:]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up, baby?
I don't know, but I don't want to grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids

Ah-ha! Yeah! C'mon!
G-g-g-g G-Unit! Hailie
What?
Come here baby, bring daddy his Oscar
OK
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass!

[Swift:]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talking 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claiming you a murderer, and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D, 'cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, 'cause he need it
And all you niggas hating, shut your mouths!
It's just that real niggas ain't buying that shit y'all put out

[Obie Trice:]
Doe, rae, me, but we don't sing, motherfuckers
So Murder Inc, do your thing, motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team
Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
"Regime" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday – how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, "Reenact him, you go platinum!"
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenacting her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, motherfucker!

[Eminem:]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Kuniva:]
Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook; get off X dick, go sing a hook!
Nigga, and you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino, you ain't shit but a bitch!
Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead and respond
And pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Proof:]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss, in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Kon Artis:]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite?
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli; get your own identity!

[Eminem:]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me 'cause you washed up, lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch! I'll fuck you up, boy! Never!
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life…
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Obie Trice:]
That's right, motherfuckers
Shady records, what you know about it?
Fuck Benzino! Fuck Ja Rule!
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah, fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real!
Candy Rain-ass nigga, he got a deal, now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade

[Hailie and Eminem:]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
No, honey, you guys are the same size[Intro: Fred Durst and Eminem]
Uh
Aiight
Check
Slim, Shady, through the mic kid, Uh
Slim Shady, Oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
From a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I say to the girl, I'm like, "What up, girl? Shut up, girl!"
Then I showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed "bloody murder" so loud everybody heard her
She slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
"Yo, baby, what are you on?"
I looked at 'em both and I was like, "Look
Check this out, toots, I'm lookin' for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week"
And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some
Here comes Fred Durst, "Now Shady, let me get some"

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose, I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick
Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no, he insisted we should go
And before I could drop him, Shady had to clock him
The music stopped, the party stood in shock
I looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

[Hook]
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Turn me loose
You better tell them to come reshingle the roof
‘Cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til I puke
Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sitting at the bar and I'm not being approached
‘Cause Fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
"Yo, Fred, save me some"
I walked to these siamese twins
And asked to have a threesome
I told them two heads are better than one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up, like, "Wait, where are you goin'?!"
Well, three strikes and I'm out
And I just struck out two times in a row (Ow!)
I ain't trying no more, fuck it, I'm chillin'
Did a shot of Jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling

[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single

[Hook]
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...Eminem: Aite
Fred Durst: Check! Slim Shady, do the mic. kid

(Eminem)
I don't do black music
I don't do Withe music
I make fight music
For High School kids
I pull side full grips
When I drive like this {screech}
With a slipped disk

From a Limp Bizkit diss
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs
Don't attempt this shit
Just step back
While I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I said to the girl, I'm like

And showed her a cut-up squirrel

{Ay yo baby!}
{What do you want?!}
I looked at 'em both and I was like
"Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie pus"
I need to speak to 'em immediately
They played my video on MTV last week
And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some
In comes Fred Durst

(Fred Durst)
Yo Shady let me get some
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the diva
Hold the flavor of a single
See me and Shady?
I think we got a lock down
Shocked by the sound
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes
I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think
Could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths
Smelt like somebody farted
So if it's time for me to move on
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk
And a prick
Ramblin' on about how
He was gonna kill me
Wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no- He insisted we should go
Before I could drop 'em
Shady had to clock 'em
The music stopped
The party stood in shock

Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

Turn me loose

Turn me loose

'Cause Fred's over there stealin' all of my hoes
{Yo Fred save me some}

And asked to have a threesome
Told 'em two heads are better that one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up like "Ay wait, where you goin" {bye!}
Oh well
Three strikes and I'm out
I struck out and stood tied to the road {ouch}
I ain't tryin' no more
Fuck it- I'm chillin'

Fell asleep on the ceiling

Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know
But I do know, I'm back now
Haha!

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain, and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Dre, I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up
Broken tibia's, fibula's, yeah fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of 'em dying from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeve Sippy cup

Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy Pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Whack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask and a boxing match

(He can't say that!)
Yes he can, I just did faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next o' kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy, especially when I flex again
And throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement

So faggoty, faggoty, faggoty, Raggedy Ann an' Andy
No, Raggedy Andy an' Andy. No, it can't be, it can't be
Yes, it can be! The fucking Antichrist is back, Danny
It's Satan in black satin panties

This is Amityville, calamity, goddammit, insanity
Pills, fanny-pack filled with Xanies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilt on my silk negligée, looky

Razor b-lades with me to make you b-leed
Cases of Maybelline make-up lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Till he jumps out the fucking toilet when you're takin' a pee

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Six semen samples, seventeen strands o' hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can-opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds

And glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fucking doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch

Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fucking Vicodin like I'm a viking
Oh, lightnin' is strikin' it might be a fucking sign I need a psychic-
Evaluation. Fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th

That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking lesbian, shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missing both legs and begging to stay

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me, I'm underground

Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions then split a bag of Funions
Mad at me, understandable, cannibal shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult

Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a Trick or Treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers

Hit Jason Voorhees with a forty
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lecter a fucking nectarine
And sat him in the fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture

Walked up Elm Street with a fucking Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Looking like I got into a fucking pillow fight with a Triple Fat Goose

Insanity, can it be vanity, where's the humanity
In havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm-and-leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred an eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it

Cut your fuckin' head off and ask, "Where you headed off to?"
Get it? "Headed off to?" Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco!

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground

Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I've disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me? I'm underground

Rehab Meeting
Random Guy
I had to get sober.
It wasn't a choice, it was, I had to do this.
And now I got 90 days clean.
And uh, that's all I have to share. 
Thanks.

Meeting Coordinator
Well thanks for sharing Brian.
There anyone else who'd like to share this evening.

Ken Kaniff 
Yeah, I got something to share...

*Singing*
When you walk through the door, you were queer to me (Is he tap dancing?)
So come here baby boy, just come here to me (Uhh why's he taking his clothes off?)
You're a cock boy, everybody wants you (That's gross)
You're gayer, than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So homie...
Lay down, down down (I'm gettin' out of here)
Lay down, down down
Lay down, down down (Have a good night)
Lay down, lay down

*Talking*
Uhh, where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay.A.
Ok wait, I got another one...

*Singing*
I just love condoms and lots of cum

*Talking*
No?
Oh, shit.

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Eminem and Swifty:
Two pills I pop till my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
Frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fucking handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurting (Bitch it's too late)
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

Swifty:
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degrading, creating murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for having blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say forgive me
I'm snatchin every penny, it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the president get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chilling in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

Eminem:
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Bizarre:
I'm a compulsive liar, setting my preacher on fire
Slashing your tires, flying down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jacking my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fucking your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for letting the record skip
Letting the record skip, letting the record skip (Damn)

I'm fucking anything when I'm snorting
It's gonna cost three hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Proof:
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with something, nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a Stop the Violence rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishing, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain bitch, I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

Kuniva:
We strangling rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatching up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva, yo, yo
I leave ya face leaking, run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preaching, take a swing at the deacon

Kon Artis:
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught selling em shape
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for having sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not giving me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggas running they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was folding some ones
Till I met your fat mama, now I'm rolling in dough

Eminem:
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Ha ha, suck my motherfuckin' dick

Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim ShadyI got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off till you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like-

Knock knock, let the devil in
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-l-l-let us in!"
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure-hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Medal win, went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, to Scribble Jam and Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said "hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely could wait
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my-

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, not knowin' with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bitten with the-)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, not knowin' with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the-)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
I-i-it's evident I'm not done
V-venomous, the thought spun
Like your web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap
Be strangled or attacked
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck a blood track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Throw the car into reverse at the Indy, end up crashin'
Into ya, the back of it-just mangled steel
My Mustang and your Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
When you're bit with the-

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
Venom, not knowin' with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliot phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake bitten with my-venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cock, bump stock, devil eye, buckshot
Tied for the uppercut, tie a couple knots
Fired up a Glock, fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitches goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not? You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a-parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me-

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum

Never gonna slow up in 'em

Yo, speed racer, 97' burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
I'm on some low ish,
I'm fed up wit the being broke ish
I'm not to joke wit
Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "Who want it?"
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it
My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it
Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her
( Right right right ! ! ! ) (( Ding ! ! ! ))
The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics
I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you,
and I'ma make sure you come back for it
So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses ( Ooh )
..Take em' on long vacation trips
Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit ((Laughter))
Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone
I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber
I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number? ( Ha.. Hot )I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

Why are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set? My arms I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp
But as soon as I grab, squeeze

I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these as pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It’s the curse of the— it’s the curse of the—)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard that the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect

I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
Till I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, "This shit is garbage!"
And God's given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive

And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water (it's true, it's true)
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-

Pectations and meet 'em, but first the "Speedom" verse
Now Big Sean he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?

Begs the question though, especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind

Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?

But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"It's 50 a.k.a Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got tyme to waste
Let's make it

You said you a gansta but you never pop nuttin'
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, yeah
You ain't no kin of mine, nah
What makes you think that I wont run up on you with the nine
We do this all tha time, right now we on tha grind
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes

Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin with they mind
I make 'em press rewind

They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

Damn Homie, in high school you was tha man, homie
What tha fuck happened to you?
I got tha sickest vendetta when it come to tha chedda
And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta

Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta
I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do better
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her

Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Guerilla unit 'cause, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

'Cause I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

Niggas sayin they goin murder 50, how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR 15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

Haha, damn homieIt's 50 a.k.a Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got tyme to waste
Let's make it

You said you a gansta but you never pop nuttin'
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, yeah
You ain't no kin of mine, nah
What makes you think that I wont run up on you with the nine
We do this all tha time, right now we on tha grind
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes

Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin with they mind
I make 'em press rewind

They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

Damn Homie, in high school you was tha man, homie

I got tha sickest vendetta when it come to tha chedda
And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta

Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta
I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do better
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her

Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Guerilla unit 'cause, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

'Cause I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

Niggas sayin they goin murder 50, how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR 15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

You said you a gangsta, but you neva pop nuttin
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long time and you ain't got nuttin'

I hit harder than four men,
Landing both gloves to a low blow with no cup
Leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls, through helmets,
With the penetration of a screw, nailed in,
Return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles we pour blood and toast death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress, doorsteps,
Slaughter lamb, and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure
Language unfam-i-liar
Art through a flooded air brush
Road leave craft
Sentences joined with words holding hands
It's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landing in exact time flight leaves.

Who's arm is this?
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
Who refused to renew my seventh presciption of Darvecets (Sorry)
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
And never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
That's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich, and just ate the knife,
My mother's screaming 'please heal and take him straight to Christ'
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin' to shake the lice
Bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm fallin' out of my bed
Found it red and my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
Occurring usually during pain for release in my urine
Screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
These pills keep screamin' :"please quit swoalloin' me"
The devil keeps screamin':"please get down on one knee"
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me.

U rockin' with the Talk of New York Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins
Here we go!")

(Chorus: Lloyd Banks)
Niggas Know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

(Tony Yayo: "Obie Trice")
(Obie Trice)
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes
Everybody runnin' for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
O's an animals skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in God it 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
Keep this a secret right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

(Tony Yayo: "Lloyd Banks")
(Lloyd Banks)
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet on words
Touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case then get a bigga one
You don't think I pack the pump 'cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains
I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, 'cause I don't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft

(Tony Yayo: "Yo Em spin that shit")
(Eminem)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gonna get it
Name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM)
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizzast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin' P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fuckin' with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spittin' baby food on people
At San Pedro ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cat peeled back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in you're like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dog
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco S.A.?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm slim sha-"D" and the "d" is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for Easter please come

(Tony Yayo: Here We Go)
(50 Cent)
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gonna get it
Name em, we gon hit em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossburg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear god 'cause I bring death
Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fin to touch something
When I raise my knife shit I'm fin to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me

(Haha Sorry Kim haha... Oh sorry haha)*Glass smashing*
*Dog's barking*

There's an intruder, in my house
He cut my phone-line, can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me, when I shout

A couple o' cocktails, will send me to jail
There's a couple of cops, hot on my trail
But this time when I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher, and a Pit Bull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit, foolin' with me
Quit foolin' with me, bitch you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be
An issue when you're me, and which you're gonna see
In the long run, Im'a be the wrong one
You wanna harass, with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass
Where was you at, last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bare arms
What I'm 'posed to fight wit' bare palms
Yeah right, they comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns, we as Americans

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

I make bookoo bucks, wear bookoo vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I could've been next, to fly over the cuckoo's nest
But you know who, with an "S" tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed' it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it 50/50 on 50, it's funny
We got a buzz spreadin' quicker than making paper airplanes out of a 20
Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said, but I said precedents
In the standards, and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
The shit should've been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, one bastard
I'm too old to go an' cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit, I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time they got the fuckin Au-to-ma-tic
Ain't no one Gon' test this Mon', clack click

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

(SSHHH)

I got a secret, if you can keep it between us
I tuck 2 Nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my Long Johns, under my Sean Johns
When runnin' with the long arm or the long long gone
Im'a do five years no less than that, o questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gone even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' gimme my semi but I got my weed back

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are AmericansYeah, told you we'd be back
Welcome 2 Hell

(Eminem)
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off
So cold I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
It's like squirting a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off
Other words I didn't put a dent in the game compared
To the damage I've yet to do
Long as you still have feelings to hurt
I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
Long as I got two balls to palm
I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm
Get scared little pissants
And see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail
Sleet with a tornado's the kind of brainstorm I get
So when the wind starts blowing, shit
Talking about going in? Going insane is more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it
Like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast don't miss it
Yeah, go ahead little prick bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit flow
Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes in it
Just know, that all he knows is this
It's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick dastardly of audacity
Mental capacity, unmatched it has to be stopped
But it can't be, but man I can't just keep
Doing them like that or no one will rap with me
Except one, you asked who is it?

(Royce)
Guess who just came through the blast, you bitches
With the ratchet, the book of Matthew
A book of matches, lighting them under white linen
You about to have to admit it, they pass you the mic
Asked you to spit it, you got handed your own ass
Your ass in your own hands, I'm sure they gon' laugh
When you're going to the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come against us
Better be something with a big foot pedigree
Easily these are the reasons
That we need to be in your prayers
Each region breeds some MCs that wanna be
Which means they wanna breath our air
With these ideas, anybody thinkin'
That the game don't need, the Bad and the Evil regime
That's like saying that bad boy Piston team didn't need Isaiah

(Eminem)
Sip piss and bleed, this is a different breed of MCs
I swear, better be aware, there's too much at stake
And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass and the shit stains on my underwear that I don't even wear

(Royce)
This gotta be no fair
This like hittin' the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter there gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got a lobotomy, your hair
Classic, smack it, smother it, read it and weep it
And perhaps you'll have no rebuttalin'
In fact, you seein' me in this rap
And it's like saying Tila Tequila can sing like Jasmin Sullivan

(Eminem)
Back to bash her skull again
Push a bitch out the Aspen until I get the fuck out of Dodge (Dodge Aspen)
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has-beens are duller than color books that ain't colored in
Second and third, fourth wind, gotta another win
Here they come again, none other than, Bad and Evil
Also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time
But I bet neither one of us have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fucking shit up on the dime so tellin' us to pipe down
It's like talking to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fighting it while he's watching internet porn
About to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is
David Carradine jacking his penis in front of his tripod
Choking his own neck, what part you don't get?
I'm saying I die hard

(Royce)
When you listen to my bars, nothin' but the F-I-R (E)
Comin' out your iPod (we) come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinning like motherfuckin' white walls

(Eminem)
Got your mother suckin' my balls
(While we) fuck each other (we) punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say I'm sor (ry, the Five-Nine and the) Fire Marshall
(We) spit with an intensity to shut shit down (in the industry
Two different entities, with a propensity
To put these N-U-T-S up inside of your fucking mouth
Welcome to the CDGuess who?
Did you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus

When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zan-tac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic is it grand?

Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man, no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back, as nasty as he can
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
Now come in girl

When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenedrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend

Brit forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middlemen
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it wont be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention

And little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
Love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim

When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you? (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

And that's why my love, you'll never live without
I know you want me girl 'cause I can see you checkin' me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you

Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breast in my mouth (blup)
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin' like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about ta flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya

Can ya blame me, you're my Amy I'm your Blake
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it, to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down, girl

When you walked through the door, (wooo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you? (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

So baby

He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
Now come in girl

Charmagne:
When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you (who can really blame you) we're the ones who made you

Eminem:
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenedrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend

Brit forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middlemen
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it wont be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention

And little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
Love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim

Charmagne:
When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you? (who can really blame you) we're the ones who made you

Eminem:
And that's why my love, you'll never live without
I know you want me girl 'cause I can see you checkin' me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you

Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breast in my mouth (blup)
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin' like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about ta flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya

Can ya blame me, you're my Amy I'm your Blake
Matter fact, make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it, to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down, girl

Charmagne:
When you walked through the door, (wooo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you? (who can really blame you) we're the ones who made you

Eminem:
So baby (baby)
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down

Oh, Amy
Rehab never looked so good
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, wooo
Dr. Dre, two-thousand and twenty
YeahPhish:
What's the difference between me and you?

What's the difference between me and you?

Dr. Dre:
Back when Cube was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business, but sometimes
the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is, and who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin they non-violent; talkin like they... (voice sample: "Do not resist the beat")
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

Chorus: Phish
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin

Xzibit:
Yo I stay wit it while you try to perpetrate, play wit it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah!)
Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down - pass it around, you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they "Soul Train" laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference

Chorus: Phish
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin

Eminem: Aight, hold up hold up! Stop the beat a minute!! 
I got somethin to say, Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
Dr. Dre: (What The fuck?!)
Eminem: I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you dawg, I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
Dr. Dre: Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
Eminem: I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?
Dr. Dre Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Eminem: Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream "I Just Don't Give a Fuck" and see who means it!

Chorus: Phish
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin

What's the difference between me and you?Ha ha
Now, now, now uh

For the cause
(Royce)
Wu-Tang killa beez forever my niggaz
Yeah, we put our draws in it, Clue

Niggaz is like "Oh my God not you"
Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E-eth man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock and roll, new tecs and calicos
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the naked call yo man method
Straight guerilla iller nigga kill a murder record

My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar ruger, bustin' yo funky dope manuevers
But I'm not ya super lover cee, I'm the super sperm
Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's lubriderm
10 out of 10 I'll be the
Men of all men I mean the
Creme de la creme a schemer
Sippin' on 'Gnac and Zima, True professional 2
(DJ clue)
Now that Bush is president nigga we all through
(Word)

It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
Why I keep on duckin' under the bed when I hear thunder
'Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in shady so they can be evil baby, I like that
I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, there'll be just as many muthafuckin' murderers
And heroin users without Marlilyn's music

But I figure I make my music, I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suein' 'cause little Darren is screwin'
Karen and Susan 'cause I told him to do it on clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
'Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's, "Fuck it" like pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a glock and just point

Now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughin' like it's funny
'Cause I don't really give a shit about no-muthafuckin'-body
I'm so muthafuckin' nutty, I don't give a fuck about nuttin'
My wrist is water and freeze
And mix this is audio Jesus the repent shit gets big
Keep it sharp like knife in a pop device
So "Duro you gotta let it bump," I came from a hard knock life

They say, "This kid be rude like this can't be true
I suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed"
Vampire, sun go down I'm still wylin'
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock city baby knife through your throat till you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all-a my dogs wit' me
And they all rich, and still all-a they palms itchy

We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walkin' like we talkin' drunk while we stumble over words
Clue, Duro, Slim, Meth
Five, Nine, Hold Up, Breath

It's just Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do
It's just Slim Shady and DJ Clue
I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do
Uh, uh Royce 5-9 and DJ Clue
I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do, uh

DJ Clue
Desert storm
Come on manYeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
"Daddy, look what I made.", dad's gotta go catch a plane

"Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?"
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine."

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya."

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right," and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

"You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone."

But baby wait, "It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream "Die Shady!" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn

(Scratched) (3x):
"No... you hear me! you go to hell" -> mr. garrison

(Eminem)
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Moms wouldn't take it, the bitch still hates me
One day she said, "go rake leaves," I said, "make me!"
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "please fix me!"
Back then, when will smith was still the fresh prince
And him and jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta the fake school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin' attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
Break shit!

(Scratched) (4x):
"No... you hear me! you go to hell!"

(Parl yams)
Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin' wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in an air lock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than james evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like kool keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease


Parl yams be the chosen thug
What I spit be cold juice like a fruitful hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper life bushwick bill fucker leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'
And moms just told me to act, I've been wheelin'
So boy just slow your deck, I've been stealin'
I wet rappers 'cause it's me and em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like (? ? ?) and bustin' your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggaz what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the dutch

(Scratched) (4x):
"No... you hear me! you go to hell!"

(Eminem)
I ended my last show with a horse swingin' a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
'Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two zantacs I give a fuck if I sound whack
Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm happy gilmore, you slip me anything in pill form
I'm in to mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays
And I'm blowin' my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats I'ma keep tryin' to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So "I'm the rapper, he's the DJ"
I'm the one that's got the six year old nephew screamin "f/u/c/k"
So jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: "no!")
Y'all can kiss my ass until your lips stick to my pants

(Scratched) (5x):
"No... you hear me! you go to hell!"[Bizarre:]
Music, reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers
Have a responsibility to these kids... Psych!

[Eminem:]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
With real life when the music stops

[Swifty McVay:]
Ain't no getting rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemies' crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think, I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
To awake neighbours for acres
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dying – you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Kon Artis:]
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends
Turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Begging with their hands out
Checking for your record when it's selling
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink till your car spin
You think "Damn!" when you slam into the wall
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops

[Kuniva:]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you with a pistol
Sipping a can of penzoil
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddy-wagon
Bragging about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dying alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype, popping shit in broad daylight
Nigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops

[Proof:]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, "Woof!"
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street: this is hardcore Blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop

[Bizarre:]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"
NWA said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail
Ninety-three was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson – who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flying down Sunset, smoking crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty
Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose
And a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock
I'm reaching for the Glock, but the music stops

[Bang]America
(Background: The white zone is for 
 loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking.)
We love you 
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech 
the United States Government has sworn to uphold
Or so we are told
(Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song)

I never would have dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me

So many lives I've touched, so much anger aimed
at no particular direction just sprays and sprays
Straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
Till it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who woulda thought standin' in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some Peroxide reachin' for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this

I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keeps tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they sayin' I'm in trouble wit the government, I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady lose Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (Ooh baby) Look at myself

Lets do the math, if I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic show me where the fuckin' studio's at

When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me almost gave up, I was like
Fuck it until I met Dre the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?

It's white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mutherfuckin' turbulence

Straight out the tube right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
Waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like I don't like yes no

All I hear is: Lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors workin' 
'Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom

So now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say "faggot"
Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the poster child
The mutherfuckin' spokesman now

For white America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this 
White America, Erica loves my shit 
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get 

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney!
Fuck you Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freedom of speech this divided state
Of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck You

Ha Ha Ha 
I'm just playin' America, you know I love youI never knew I..

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this {*tires screech*}
I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!)
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?
Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out
(Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
{*ewwww*} Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
(The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents

Chorus: Eminem

Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

(Eminem)
So who's bringin the guns in this country?  (Hmm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
screamin "Go," with their 17-year-old Uncle
I'm like, "Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
(Hmm?)  So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse
("Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!")
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

Chorus

(Eminem)
I never knew I.. knew I'd..
have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)
How many retards'll listen to me
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn!  How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not

Chorus

(Eminem)
How the fuck was I supposed to know?I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzing
Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism
The devil ain't on the level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs like they did something to me personally
Used to get bullied so I cut class and ditched it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can't tell 'em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin' I don't give a fuck I don't play!
Bitch you think you saw this basket first?
Your ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
Ripped a gaping hole in it
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
Tied them around my neck, went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face gibberish
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale of being gay ya
Little faggot. By the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay
It's a fucking miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, sons you, like an ultra violet ray
I'm selling hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm shittin' on the competition
In the meantime it's always mean time

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
That cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'mma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
It's 'cause I am don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways
Lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't, I need my meds I peed my bed
I'm going blind I don't see my legs I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
Then you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut the P-I-E holes, now peep my game

'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it like a lyco fucking (fucking fuck it)
Echo... Psycho on a cyclone cycle
Spiraling, here I go, I'm outta control like no
Other mic go, stab you till the knife goes dull
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'mma sock it to you
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night so
Strike up the fucking maestro, I'm nitro
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole
Deeper in, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

Skit:
Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
Shit
It's a girl
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show...
Why do I know that voice?
Butt-fuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
- Are you fucking serious?
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then
Blow it our your assObie Trice:

Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker

'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney

A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you Debbie"

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

"Testing, attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot
He fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely as 'bout it as retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester
We tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe
Might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent-free (Real talk!)
I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches
That's none of my business, but I don't sip tea (It's Nickel)
Ridin' 'round his block; all he know is pitfalls
That's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka!) (Sean Don…)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut; no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit
And you ain't rewindin' me
Self-made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church, tryna get a little savings, yeah, a coupon
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, "You still ain't got a new line?"
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach, with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel, lil' bitch!

[Hook: Dej Loaf]

Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
‘Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Have K's in front of your school, but I ain't goin' to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross-eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against
The world, like it was before my life became a movie and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick!
I still never ABC this shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's ragin' and heated and
On the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if
I wasn't me I probably wouldn't
Want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
Hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryin' to reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
‘Cause so cold in the D, it is
As days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
What made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and
Attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us…

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em, if they want it
They can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city
I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me
They ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey, Em, let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'!
Detroit! Okay!Obie Trice:
Obie Trice - real name, no gimmicks.

I've created a monster, 'cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker

Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be 
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you Debbie." 

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cuz we need a little controversy
'Cuz it feels so empty without me 

I said this looks like a job for me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless,
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves 
A rebel, so let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it 

Up under your skin like a splinter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

Girl I'm too for real lose your tooth and nail
Try to fight it try to deny it stupid you will feel

What I do I do at will, shootin' from the hip, yeah boy, shoot to kill
Half a breath left, on my death bed
Screamin' F that, yeah super ill

Baby what the deal, we can chill, split a half a pill and a happy meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill

Listen garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel, knowin' you're disposable
Summer's Eve, Massengil

Shady's got that mass appeal, baby crank this shit 'cause it's your God damn jam
You say that you want your punch lines a little more compact, well shorty I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a valium and said settle your fuckin' ass down
I'm ready for combat, man

Get it, calm batman, naw, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as
Nuts, lines are like mom's cat scans 'cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass, swear to God man, these broads can't dance

Girl shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet ya that you'll never guess whose knockin' at your doors
People hit the floors, yeah tonight ladies you gon' get divorced
Girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with Chris' force like you pissed him off

Talented with the tongue, mo'fucker you ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores, makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest, I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back, bring me two extension cords

I'ma measure my dick, shit I need six inches more, fuck, my dick's big
Bitch, need I remind you that I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig
You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here, need a fix up
I'm the big shot, get it, dick snots, you're just small pokes, little pricks (ha)

Girl you think that other pricks hot, I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'Fore I sit back and let him get hotter, better call the cops on him, quick-fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass, white trash with a half a six-pack
In his hatch back trailer hitch attached to the back (dispatch)

Eminem:
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin', does a bird chirp,flu
Does Lil Wayne slurp syrup till he burps and smoke purp, does a word search
Gettin' circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through, I'd like you to
Remind yourself of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic, girl, you're the kind of girl that I can take a likin' to

Psych, I'm spikin' you like a football, been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse, got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain, bitch you listening
Tryin' to turn me down, slut I'm talkin' to you, turn me back up, are you insane?

Tryin' to talk over me in the car, shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life, what's the saying, where there's thunder, there's lightning
And they say that it never stikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times in three different locations on four separate occasions

And you can bet your stinkin' ass that I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path, poison ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance floor, cutie, while I do my duty on this microphone, shake your booty
Shorty I'm the shit, why you think Proof used to call me Doody

P!nk:
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh noYeah! Oh, get up! I said, get up! Let's go!

Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the mornin' sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

Man first of all I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors

With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him

'Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance

She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (white trash party)

Pull a 5th of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed

Till I feel like I've been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like im hollerin', "Die Santa!"
Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and 2 innocent bystanders

So quit tryin' to play the Wall like you're Paul and
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'

Makin' it rain for the ladies in the Mini's
But im not throwin' ones, five, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at Skinny's
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's

From the north, east and west but when it comes to them trailers in them Southparks
Muffle it 'cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies, if your belly button's not an innie then im outtie
Now hop in my mini-van, let's get rowdy, come on

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (white trash party)

Now whether your black, white or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know your up to evil and your no damn good
Get on the floor, man and rep yo hood

Now, honey, don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot 'cause, girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window out of my Gremlin, put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick, it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y and I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater

I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now, I'm so raw, I still need to un-thaw
You feel me y'all, I'll shut the club down like Drake in the mall

But, baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now get up

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party (white trash party)

So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know, ya better ask somebody
'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (white trash party)(spoken)
What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough
If you will, to be saved not in a religious sense, 
but not to constitute what this country, at times, calls "we throw away children"
We seem to be approaching an age of the gross (burp)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station
And each generation should do a little bit better

Alright come on let's cut this bullshittin' and dub
Let's get it started let's start addressin' this issue
And open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And this whole origin of

The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
The music that you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was boy on the East side of Detroit
Crossin' 8 Mile and a war and they hit territory

I'd like to share a story this is my story
And can't nobody tell it for me
I am well aware that I don't belong here
You made that perfectly clear

I get my ass kicked, damn they're everywhere
From Bel Air shoppin' centre just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side
A day that I might slide

You may call it a pass I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious, so well known tracks

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up they'd give me a lift up
8 Mile and Van Dyke I'd steal a goddamn bike

From somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her momma's and charmer's
After dark to sneak me in the house
When I'm kicked out my mom's

That's about the time I first met Proof, we'd goof
He'd carry on the steps said I was bored handin' out some flyers
He was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check this out some time

He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And they both had the same rhymes that soundalike

We was on that same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade 
Can't forget that day in school 
It was cool til' your man MC Sham came through
And said that Puma's the brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops

It was rumors but man, goddamn they flew
Must'a been true because man we done banned they shoes,
I had the new ones, the cool J, Ice-lambs, suede too.
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they was yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X-clan debuted


With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter, would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off
Not knowing at all we was being laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at

Manix's basement, saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is...
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me

And there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time

But it backfired I was supposed to dump her
But she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to
The oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize, I was wrong
'Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a hoe

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet homeShady... Yeah...

(Verse 2 ] [ Eminem)

When me and fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images [come on!]
But this shit is new gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out (whoooo!)
When it's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, we don't resolve it
It just usually jus' evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it [yeah!]
We should all get a merit, as much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's shady after-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass [yeah... Come on!]
Come izzon what kinda fizz-uckin' question is that

Who run it? [you know, you actin' like you don't know]

And you know but actin' like you don't know
Who run it? [i said you know, you actin' like you don't know]
I tear the club up fo' sho
(This flow is gon' bring more dough)
And you know but actin' like you don't know {cashis, break it down now!}

(Verse 3 ] [ Cashis)

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way
Forever I'ma be a shady 7-4 gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off-a danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me... [Banks!]

(Verse 4 ] [ Lloyd banks)

Enough holdin' back the steam (uh), Em let off a magazine
Dappadon cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams (yeah)
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' g [uh huh!]
I'ma hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet [oh!]
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it... [come on!]

We run it! You know, you actin' like you don't know [whoa!]

Who run it?

(Outro ] [ Tony Yayo)

You know what this is...
Shady... G-unit... Aftermath...
Lloyd banks... Cashis... Marshall Mathers... Ferrari F-50...
It's a movement... You can't stop it...
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo...
Go..."I've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin' obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits."
I need you to spit that lyrical miracle… in the swimming pool

Before this kicks off, let me set my balls in this tees
'Cause I'm dottin' i's every time I cross one of these
There's not a redeeming quality at all in me
It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream
Positive clean thoughts intervene
But they're all either altered and mean
Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
Squashed in between a brainwashing machine
Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical
Suicide bomber that's seeing
Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening
And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving
Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region
I'm not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons
But bring your dogs, I'ma muzzle 'em
I'm not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch Raqqa hijab
And at least a extra large in a T-shirt
Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista
I go Hamas on the beats to a paradox on the beach
And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list
Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich
Professional shit sprayer
Bitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear
Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce
Prey's decreasing, I face extinction like disc players
Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett
And just stared 'til I made her think it
Said, "Maybe we should just get married."
She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square
Tell her, "Turn around," spread her legs for me, then I hit bare
Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair
As I rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear
Spray Febreze in the chick's hair
Make her wheeze tryna get air
I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared
And chained to me, and throw away the key
And she'll be so afraid to leave
That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there
Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up
It's impossible like rapin' a slut
We stay butt-naked and fuck
You're close, wait for you, what?
My idea, you comin' too, is waking you up
With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup
That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup
Hate to get bogged down in details
But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females
My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler
I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular
Shape but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut
And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck
Or helps you rake in the ducats, I want payment in pub
'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club
But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut

Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it
Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it
Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it
Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it
Tryna commit suicide and it, took five minutes
And I survived the shit
Someone's gonna challenge me, who?
Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too
You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality
You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale
Only time I start a movement's a bowel
I can't even give a "yeah" or a "woo" when you rap in the booth
Not even a "nah" or a "boo"
'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew
When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too
'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do
But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you

Creature from the Black Lagoon
I reach up and I smack the moon
You're grief struck that I'm back so soon
Your teacher for this afternoon
Creep up with a pack of hoodlums
We pack a punch like Capri Sun
Heat tucked like we each snuck in a submachine gun
We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms
Cup of lean up in the padded room
Justin Bieber in a Catholic school
Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him
Don't adjust your speaker
I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo
Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes
Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon
While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop
'Cause her double G-cups are massive, huge!
It's fun for me just to grab a boob
Plus my penis got an attitude
My fuckin' weiner's in a combative mood
Come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you
I speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do
'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true

I just sprung a leak suddenly
What I think in my gut instinct become in sync
My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other
Ink touches the pad, then boom!
Since the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite
That's basically what makes me me
Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink
Who's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink
ADD, and better put out an APB
'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street
For you to see Shady beat
And I'll bet ya they'd need cleats
'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat
I pray please Jesus to make me decent
Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline
I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing
I stay free of divas and ladies screamin'
'Cause they keep schemin' on me
Vading keepin' the women at bay
Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses
Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen
It's straight demon—and wait!
Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers
Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat
Emcees take seats like AMC theaters
Deranged ringleader, depraved king
Who mainstream media hates
Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny
Villainous smooth criminal, livin' room
With the nude Reese Witherspoon
Who was bruised, beat with a broom
It's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it
Pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it
R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it
It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces
The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
'Cause my brain releases 'em

Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously
As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves
Just to fill 'em's a huge feat
A hill and it's too steep
Obey these demons, we're still in cahoots
Keep feedin' me blank sheets
As soon as I sink these teeth
And I'm killin' the loose leaf
Time to shake these trees again
Wait, make that phrase repeat again
Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em

Vicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them
The whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons
And I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks
On the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance
Who I influence I give two shits
If they wanna license my music to entice with
Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment

Excuse me while I stare into space for a few
In a daze or haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon
Mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view
But you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel
No one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude
Beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it
And this has little to do with bein' gay, boy
It's just where the wordplay's goin'
But ain't much I can say or do
'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored}
You say I'm always screw-faced
So if I look your way, you're screwed
'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate war too
'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you

Let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants
To the Nike, Jordan, hats
The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees
Lightning storms might be formed fast
Such a frightening forecast
But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp
From the cyphering or-gasp, but still reciting your raps
While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past
'Cause your heiny's sore, that's
'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass
From the night before last
No good, but rap somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at
Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat
Where your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact
They're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?
So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sewed 'em back

Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap
For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back
So difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it
So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class
The bear you don't wanna poke is back
The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks
When I appear, my peers stop
Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop
Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
Fear at the mere thought
Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top
I'm in the sky when I talk
Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop

Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you
I got a idea for a line
