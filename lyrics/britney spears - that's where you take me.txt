Oh baby oh baby
Oh baby oh baby

In love no believe
Never found inside of me
Built these walls up so high
Needed my room to breathe

Oh baby oh baby
You tell them down
Can't believe you changed my mind
Oh baby oh baby
I saw your smile
Stay with me awhile

(chorus)

All things fall into place
My heart it feels so safe
You are my melody
That's where you take me
With you I get so high 
Lost in the crystal sky
You are this melody
That's where you take me

I never fell before
How did you find the door?
The key to my soul
To you forever more

Oh baby oh baby
You make me rise
Never did I once think twice
Oh baby oh baby
You make me smile
Stay with me awhile 

(Repeat chorus)

Afraid to let it all inside
Now I wanna hear you 
Stay with me awhile
Stay with me awhile
La la la la la la(3x)

That's where you take me

(repeat chorus till fade..)
