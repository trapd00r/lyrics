[dmx]
Somethin' new

(chorus 2x)
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop oh, no
That's how ruff ryders roll

[dmx]
Niggaz wanna try, niggaz wanna lie
Then niggaz wonder why, niggaz wanna die
All I know is pain all I feel is rain
How can I maintain, with mad shit on my brain
I resort to violence, my niggaz move in silence
Like you don't know what are style is
New york niggaz the wildest
My niggaz is wit' it
You want it? come and get it
Took it then we split it
You fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gonna do
When we run up on you
Fuckin' wit' the wrong crew
Don't know what we goin' thru
I'ma have ta show niggaz
How easily we blow niggaz
When you find out there's somemore niggas
That's runnin with your niggaz
Nothin' we can't handle
Break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle
Just cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes
Like you bussin' grapes
Think you holdin weight? 
Then you haven't met the apes

(chorus 2x)

[dmx]
Is y'all niggaz crazy? 
I'll buss you and be swazy
Stop actin' like a baby,
Mind your business lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' ta get rid of you
Yeah I know it's pitiful
That's how niggaz get down
Watch why niggaz spit round
Make y'all niggaz kiss ground
Just for talkin' shit clown
Oh you think it's funny
Then you don't know me money
It's about to get ugly
Fuck it dog I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean
Come up off that green
Five niggaz or a fiend
Don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone
Leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And yo i'ma slave til' my home is a grave
I'ma pull paper, it's all about the papers
Bitches talkin' paper, then how they wanna rape us

(chorus 2x)

[dmx]
Look what you just started
Asked for it, you got it
Had it, should have shot it
Now your dearly departed
Get at me dog,
Did I rip shit
With this one here I flip shit
Niggaz know when I kick shit
It's gonna be some slick shit
What was that look for
When I walked in the door
Oh you thought you was raw
Boom! not anymore!
Cause now you on the floor
Wishin you never saw
Me walk through that door, with that 4 4
Now it's time for bed
Two more to the head, got the floor red
Yeah that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery,
It's goin' down in history
Niggaz ain't never did shit to me
Bitch ass niggaz can't get to me
Gots to make the move,
Got a point to prove
Got a make'em grove, got'em all like ooh
So to the next time, you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind, on gettin pussy and crime

(chorus 1x)

(gunfire!)

Talk is cheap muthafucka!
