I hate you as many as you are!

Enthroned on the highest chair, a little
Tiny peek at me and then back to your world
Playing for the staff that couldn’t care less
Singing as low as possible but

I hate the way you make me feel annoying
I hate the power you’ve got on my self esteem
Pieces of my heart shared with strangers
I hate you as many as you are!

This barmaid is a shame to her place, ignoring
That I have asked 20 times for a drink
Thirsty, watching you and your sweet glass of wine
But haven’t you seen the no-smoking sign
Swimming in my sweat it’s so fucking hot in here
Diving on the rocks you’re so fucking hard to reach
Is there a way to get any attention?!?

I hate you as many as you are!

You know it’s true myself can be the way to see
Words that wouldn’t make sense if you were listening to me
Please singer, sing us a song we all know by heart ‘cause
We’re only open to new radio stuff
I’m also entirely sure my place is not here
I would really enjoy switching places with you
Judging this girl who is only trying to pay her bills

Fuck you as many as you are!

I hate the way you make me feel annoying
I hate the power you’ve got on my self esteem
Pieces of my heart shared with strangers

I hate you as many as you are!
The sound’s bad, the voice is too loud, it’s not my kind of music
She’s always singing the same songs, sorry if I only know two thousand
Do you know this band? Well, you should, this is your kind of music
It’s not my fault if you got nothing else to do but be here 3 days a week
I hate the way you make me feel annoying
I hate the power I give you on my self-esteem
Between a drunk ass and me guess who’s the most annoying?!

Fuck you!
