Lost in your eyes
In your beautiful eyes
When you look at me
I realize

I'm feeling strong
Every day all night long
If you don't leave me here all alone

Lost in the rain
Walking under the rain
Did you call me
I hear you again

I will survive
Even just for a while
If you keep turning back in my life

Open your eyes
I live in you
I'm lost in you
If only I could

If you open the door
I'll love you more
Don't leave me girl anymore

(Come with me)

Lost in your eyes
In your beautiful eyes
When you look at me
I realize

I'm feeling strong
Every day all night long
If you don't leave me here all alone

Lost in your mind
Everywhere in your mind
When you make love with me
I can find

I can destroy any dark, any noise
If you trust in me
Right now in my voice

Chrous:

Come with me
