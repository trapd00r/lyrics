Stand up, take a bow
You're leaving so who's laughing now
Just yourself by yourself
No one else, there's no one else

Face the end
Walk out the door
You're leaving, giving up on us all
Just yourself by yourself
No one else here who can help

Now you wake up tired
So uninspired
To face the world
The world's on fire

Lay down on the floor
It's over, you don't care anymore
Face yourself by yourself
No one else here who can try

Wake up, wake up
To the world
The world's on fire

Where did we go wrong?
Fighting for so long

I didn't ask for this at all
When my back's against the wall
And my face painted for war
I didn't ask for this at all
