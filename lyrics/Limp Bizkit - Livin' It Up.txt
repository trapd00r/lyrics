(Life in the fast lane)
This is dedicated to you, Ben Stiller
You are my favorite motherfucker!
I told you, didn't I?

Drama makes the world go around
Does anybody got a problem with that? (yeah)
My business is my business
Who's guilty? Can I get a witness?
First things first
The chocolate starfish, my man - Fred Durst
Access Hollywood, license to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bringing on the dumpster funk
A microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rockin' so steady with the "he says, she says"
And don't forget about the Starfish Navigation System
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty-seven tons of new millennium
Dum ditty dum, where's it coming from
Missus Aguilera, come and get some
Oh no, which way to go?
To the dance floor in stewa-stereo
Pay me no mind
I seen the Fight Club about twenty-eight times

And I'm-a keep my pants sagging
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm-a keep a lot of girls on my beer wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck
Livin' life in the fast lane

Yeah! (Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
Yeah! (Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck in the fast lane

Take two (who-wah!)
Now who's the starsucker?
I'm the starfish, you silly motherfucker
Puff, puff, give the marijuana cig--oops
I don't even smoke, but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females, hemales
Sippin' Mums champagne from a seashell
I take a counterfeit, and pop his ass like a zit
With the Starfish Navigation System
No cheap thrills, baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run-of-the-mill fella
Spittin' out hella mic skills

And I'm-a keep my pants sagging
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm-a keep a lot of girls on my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck
Livin' life in the fast lane

Yeah! (Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
Yeah! (Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck in the fast lane

'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie
And it's so easy to run and hide
But it's not easy to be alive
So don't be wasting none of my time!

This world is like a cage
And I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think that anybody cares
It'll eat a hole (what)
Down inside of me (what)
And it will leave a scar (what)
Can anybody see (what)
That we gotta get it out
We gotta get it out
We gotta get it out
We gotta get it out
We gotta get it out
And I'm-a get it out
With a motherfuckin' microphone, plug it in my soul
I'm a renegade riot gettin' out of control
I'm-a keepin' it alive and continue to be
Flying like an eagle to my destiny
So can you feel me, hell yeah
Can you feel me, hell yeah
Can you feel me, hell yeah
If you feel me, motherfucker, then you say, hell yeah
Then you say, hell yeah
Then you say, hell yeah
I'm livin' life in the fast lane!

'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie
And it's so easy to run and hide
But it's not easy to be alive
So don't be wasting none of my time!

Yeah, bring it on
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck in the fast lane
