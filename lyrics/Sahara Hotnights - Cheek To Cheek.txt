Face to face cheek to cheek
Do you hear the pounding beat?
Don't care what's on my baby's mind
Face to face cheek to cheek
Let's leave it just like this
Right after all is said and done

Call me a cynic
I knew it all the while
Let's not put the blame
Why don't we say
There comes a time
Once you are in it
Trying your best to hide
And you count down ten to one
Because when on zero you can smile

Face to face cheek to cheek
Do you hear the pounding beat?
Don't care what's on my baby's mind
Face to face cheek to cheek
That's the sound of peace
Right after all is said and done

You called me bossy
I started to prize control
With a script tight in my hand
I began studying my role
I picked the games I set up rules alone
Now you pick from either watch
Or baby simply play along

Face to face cheek to cheek
Do you hear the pounding beat?
Don't care what's on my baby's mind
Face to face cheek to cheek
That's the sound of peace
Right after all is said and done
