He rushes to the cliff and scrambles down the rocks. It takes him a long time to get down to the water, trying to keep up with the current at the same time. As he nears the water's edge he sees John losing strength.

Struggling down the slope
There's not much hope
I begin to try to ride the scree
But the rocks are tumbling 
All around me

If I want John alive
I've got to ditch my fear 
Take a dive
While I've still got my drive 
To survive

Evel Knievel 
You got nothing on me
Here I go!
