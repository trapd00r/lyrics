Feel My Presence
Save you efforts
Just talk to me

Like a prayless heart, you kill me
Please talk to me
Say why am I different?

Hold me now, don?t bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
I see faces around me, 
Gathered here to laugh
When I try to speak to you

Are everything I feel, somehow
And you keep closer than you should, 
So help me now

(Hide away, Hide away, hide away, hide away?)

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is tragical
And I?m just caught in the middle, oh
I?ve got no direction, I wish you could help me

Hold me now, don?t bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
I see faces around me, 
Gathered here to laugh

When I try to speak to you

Are everything I feel, Somehow
And you keep closer than you should, 
So help me now

And I don?t think I know it?s better
To follow this and walk on through

It?s easy to say I?m sorry
Cus you always say ?Don?t Worry?
And I don?t think I know it?s better
To follow this and walk on through

(Hide away, Hide away, hide away, hide away?)

Hold me now, don?t bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
Hold me now, don?t bother
If every second it makes me weaker
Hold me now, don?t bother
If every second it makes me weaker
Hold me now, don?t bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
