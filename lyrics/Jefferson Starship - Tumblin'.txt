When love comes tumblin' down
Tumblin' down to the truth
And can't fall no more
Can't fall no more - oh baby, baby, baby
Don't be blue
I'll stand by you
And we'll get that feelin'
Just like before
Only more and more and
Love'll mean something again
Oh, baby, you know it can
Be just like heaven
It was heaven before - yes, it was
Oh, if you stand by me
I'll stand by you
And the feelin' it'll get
Stronger and stronger
Won't be much longer
Cause

This time this love's gonna grow


This time you'll never go
This time I'll love you so
This time everything we ever wanted
This time our love's gonna grow
This time I'll never let go
This time I'll love you so
This time everything that we could ever feel
In lovin'
I feel it's comin'
Now I know the meanin'
I'm through with all the driftin', the dreamin'

'Cause when love comes tumblin' down
Tumblin' down to the truth
It can't fall no more

Tumblin', tumblin', tumblin'/ tumblin', tumblin',
Tumblin'
Tumblin', tumblin', tumblin'/ tumblin', tumblin',
Tumblin'
Tumblin', tumblin', tumblin'
