[Chorus Ã¢â¬â Lloyd]
Red dogs hit my trap
Got me four a half a song been trapin' all day
Can't wait to get home,
Shawty in the bed she ain't got no panties on
Soon as I hit the door she already know it's on,
2 logs 2 shots of patron greygoose got her loose
A triple stack and it's on talking dirty on the chirp
Getting my grown man on
Get up in the guts
You know it's on 'til the morning

[Verse 1] 
Got one baby mama, no bitch, no wife 
Like pac, ya need a thug in your life (yeaÃ¢â¬Â¦)
A young nigga to straight come through and beat it up 
Let ya man be the freak, he can eat it up (ha haa) 
Shorty got that fire she ainÃ¢â¬â¢t let me down yet (nope) 
Got a Aquafina flow, call it well wet (damnn)
Baby good with her mouth, says the right things 
Got a head on her shoulders, she does the right things (ha haa) 
She a bad bitch, yaÃ¢â¬â¢ll ready know 
Face like Trina, and an ass like Jacki-o (ohh) 
Got a gangsta on a mission (mission) 
Best believe I know all the right positions (thatÃ¢â¬â¢s right..)
She like it slow from the front, fast from the back (back) 
Put the pound game on her, hit her from the back (Jeahh) 
IÃ¢â¬â¢m young and thuggin, I donÃ¢â¬â¢t give a fuck
He can make love to you, IÃ¢â¬â¢ma beat it upÃ¢â¬Â¦ 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2] 
Me & shawty in the coop, lord knows sheÃ¢â¬â¢s a star (star)
For some strange reason she likes to do it in the car (damnn) 
She ainÃ¢â¬â¢t the type that be running her mouth (nope) 
So I keep it gangsta with her, let her come to the house (eyy) 
Let her play matter wit slick, when we in the bedroom she like to play with the stick (yeaÃ¢â¬Â¦) 
know just how to handle her (howÃ¢â¬Â¦) 
No amateur baby, I got stamina (jeah) 
Jeezy in the deck, now she grindin to the beat (beat) 
Legs vibratin, now she messin up my sheets (ha haa) 
Got a fistful of hair, and a fistful of ass (ass)
She came first, I came last, roll tha grassÃ¢â¬Â¦(eyy) 

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 "Slick Pulla"]
We pull bad hoes, rip them, push them to the side 
Cuz real players, keep reserves when its clinch time 
Matter fact, my bottom bitch love to ride pine 
She know when daddy leave the block, that its cut time 
I'm in the trenches, getting riches wit my comrades 
We 4 hoes up, like slacks in the player path 
Pretty skin, silky hair, plus that ass fat (uh huh) 
Fresh kicks on your feet, ya IÃ¢â¬â¢m diggin that 
Slick consako, ya boys slingin wood bitch 
You want that straight drop dick
Come to the hood bitch
I like scout them ghetto hoes up in 20 grand 
Cuz them the ones be wit that freaky shit man 
2 drinks, 3 beans, now she rollin man 
The tool in her throat, IÃ¢â¬â¢m just tonsil patrollin man 
True pro's  with this shit, we ainÃ¢â¬â¢t new jacks 
We drill hoes and switch Ã¢â¬Ëem up like fitted caps

[Chorus]
