Inside every memory of you and me the rain begins to fall.
In an ocean of my fears I know you won't be leaving me at all.
All your everlastin words in dead old letters prophedied the end.
But I never ever stop believing that our waste souls are bent.

When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
When you call me I'll be there for you.
When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
When you call me I'll be there for you.

I'm remembering the scars and wounds I know you suffered from the rain.
Is there anything that I can do to free your soul from all the pain.
With your everlasting words you tried so hard to tell me that you're gone.
But I never ever start believing that you leave me all alone.

When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
When you call me I'll be there for you.
When you call me I'll be there to guide you.
When you call me I'll be there for you.
