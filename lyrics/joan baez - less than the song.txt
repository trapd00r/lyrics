I am less than the song I am singing
I am more than I thought I could be
Spent some time as a child in day dreaming
As a young one I sailed on the sea

So come stand by my side where I am going
Take my hand if I stumble to fall
It's the strength that you share when your growing
That gives me what I need most of all
That gives me what I need most of all

Diffrent minds, different ways
Diffrent reasons to believe
Some far journeyswe have taken
Some sweet dreams we've had to leave

And I want you to be happy
And I hope you always will
Or I cannot rest easy
Till all your dreams are real
Till all your dreams are real
