I’m a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
You’re the bird on the brim
Hypnotized by the whirl

Drink me, make me feel real
Wet your beak in the stream
[the] Game we’re playing is life 
Love’s a two way dream

Leave me now — return tonight
[the] Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name you will go astray
Like a killer whale trapped in a bay

I’m a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You’re the one who walks me
I’m your one-way street


I’m a whisper in water
[a] Secret for you to hear
You’re the one who grows distant
When I beckon you near

Leave me now — return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name go astray
Like a killer whale trapped in a bay

I’m a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You’re the intruder’s hand
I’m the branch that you break

[sung in Icelandic:]
Life is a necklace of fears 
Your uncried tears on a string
Our love will untie them — come here 
Loving me is the easiest thing
