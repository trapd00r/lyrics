I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, ho
Like the deserts miss the rain

And could you be dead
You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run

I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

I'm back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging round your old address

And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

And I miss you, ho oh
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
(And I miss you)

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
I guess you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you, yeah
And I miss you
You found some better place
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
The deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
