When I was just a little baby boy, my mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man, she used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it, 'cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more

These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you

Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma
Oh now he's raping his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover

You god damn right bitch and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn

Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you, you don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me

I said, you don't, wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (Haha)
I said, you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Bitch I'ma kill you, like a murder weapon I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em

I ain't 'Acid Rap' but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
Whoops is that a subliminal hint, no
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again

Eminem offend, no, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth

Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub, but that's normal' ain't it Norman

Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you, you don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me

I said, you don't, wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (Haha)
I said, you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Know why I say these things
'Cause lady's screams, keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things tweece

Twice, whatever I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink

Fuck that, I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in school to before school to out of school

I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache

You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knife-point, then you beg me to stop
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you, you hear me, answer me

Or I'ma kill you, you don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth, with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me, bitch I'ma kill you

You don't, wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you
I said, you don't, wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Spoken:
(Haha) I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you
