I know you'll never stay the same.
In time, most of us lose it.
But I'm hoping, just the same,
You'll shine and learn how to use it.


Speak to me, like the very first speak.
You are magnificent when you're innocent.
Laugh to me, like the very first laugh.
You are from heaven sent when you're innocent.


My hands hold you and you adore,
Blue eyes turn my direction.
Surprise in everything and your
Body moves in perfection.


Smile to me, like the very first smile.
You are magnificent when you're innocent.
Walk to me, like the very first walk.

You are from heaven sent when you're innocent.

You're innocent
You're innocent
You're innocent
You're innocent

Speak to me, like the very first speak.
You are magnificent when you're innocent.
Laugh to me, like the very first laugh.
You are from heaven sent when you're innocent.


Smile to me, like the very first smile.
You are magnificent when you're innocent.
Walk to me, like the very first walk.
You are from heaven sent when you're innocent.
