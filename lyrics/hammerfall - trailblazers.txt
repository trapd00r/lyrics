It's been a long way but now we are near
The midst of the fiery rain
We know the Thunder have summoned us all
To the place were innocence got slain

Behold the omens, the rivers run red
The autumn winds carry the dead
The final warning, the very last command
Shattered remains for the damned

We won't surrender
No never, we will carry on

From the Lake of Fire they have come
Fierce almighty legions, one by one
When the Flames of Glory touch the sky
Trailblazers do or die

We are the mighty, who soar through the air,
Creating our own destiny
Warriors once and Warriors to be
Forever our spirits fly free

We rode on lightning we shone like the sun
In a thunderous symphony
We fought them hard we fought them so brave,
Sending them back to their grave

The Hammer has fallen
The fire still burns in our hearts

From the Lake of Fire they have come
Fierce almighty legions, one by one
When the Flames of Glory touch the sky
Trailblazers do or die

The visions we gazed upon,
As the nightmare returned
On the uncaring slopes
The mark of the shadows still burns

From the Lake of Fire they have come
Fierce almighty legions, one by one
When the Flames of Glory touch the sky
Trailblazers do or die

From the Lake of Fire they have come
Fierce almighty legions, one by one
When the Flames of Glory touch the sky
Trailblazers do or die
