Look into my eyes, don't you trust me
yr so good you could go far
I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna
you could be a star
you could go far
you've got twistability
you fly hard, don't you wanna
you've got kissability
you could be a star, it ain't hard

yr driving me crazy, you smell so sick
yr driving me crazy, give us a kiss

look into my eyes, don't you trust me
yr so soft, you make me hard
I'll put you on a movie, don't you wanna
you could be a star, you could go far
you've got kissability
you sigh hard, don't you wanna
you've got twistability
you could be a star, it ain't hard

yr driving me crazy, you smell so sick
I feel so tired, you make me sick
yr driving me crazy, if I feel so sick
yr driving me crazy, give us a kiss

Look into my eyes, don't you diss me
You're so good, you could go far
I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna
You could be a star, you could go far
You've got twistability
You fly hard, don't you wanna
You've got kissability
You could be a star, it ain't hard

You're driving me crazy, smell so sick
You're driving me crazy, give us a kiss
