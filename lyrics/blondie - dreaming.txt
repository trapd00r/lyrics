When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure?
I'll have a cup of tea 
And tell you of my dreaming

Dreaming is free
Dreaming
Dreaming is free

I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real, or is it fantasy?
Real to real is living rarity
People stop and stare at me 
We just walk on by
We just keep on dreaming

Feet, feet
Walking a two mile
Meet, meet
Meet me at the turnstile
I never met him 
I'll never forget him

Dream, dream
Even for a little while
Dream, dream
Filling up an idle hour
Fade away 
Radiate

I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'll build a road and go 
Just to have some dreaming

Dreaming is free
Dreaming
Dreaming is free
Dreaming
Dreaming is free
Dreaming is free
