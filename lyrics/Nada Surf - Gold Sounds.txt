The way I see it
When I'm falling asleep
That the mountain's not too steep
Anyway I believe we're gonna get there
Get this thing into the air
Get it up into the air

Gold sounds
Gold sounds

You're always in my mind
Since before you were a child
And my love for you's entire
But it gets multiplied and not divided
Almost nothing is one-sided
Please accept I think you'll like it

We can grow
Through things we don't know

Gold sounds

You're always in my mind
Since before you were a child
And my love for you's entire
But it gets multiplied and not divided
Almost nothing is one-sided
Please accept I think you'll like it

Anchors away
We can float all day

Gold sounds
