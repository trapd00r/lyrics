So, if you're falling for a witch,
be careful
Cause she will make your heart go wrong
Yer, if you're falling for a witch,
be careful
You'll be enchanted by her song
You say she's a witch
Baby, I don't care
Cause she looks so good
With a red-red hair
You say she's a witch
But that's all lies
When I look so deep
In green-green eyes
Oh, babe, babe, don't you understand
I don't know what I'm doing
When she takes my hand
You say she's a witch
Baby, look at me
I say: "It's pure energy!"
So, if you're falling for a witch,
be careful
Cause she will make your heart go wrong
Yer, if you're falling for a witch,
be careful
You'll be enchanted by her song
Oh, if you're falling for a witch
She'd take you
Wherever she wants you to go
Oh, if you're falling for a witch
She'd break you
But, baby, you will never know
You say she's a witch
And she'd do wrong
But I like that heat
Which is on my own
You say she's a witch
But I don't mind
Cause she makes me live
When I'm just behind
Oh, babe, babe, don't you understand
She's leaving me to strange land
You say she's a witch
Baby, look at me
I say: "It's pure energy!"
