I can't pretend anymore
That I am not affected, I'm not moved,
I can't lie to myself that I'm not always thinkin' of you.

You make me strong,
You show me I'm not weak to fall in love
When I thought I'd never need, now I can't get enough.

I've always made it on my own,
I've always thought that I would keep control.
You changed everything I believe in
And now I just can't fight this feeling, baby.

I raise my hands and I surrender
'Cause your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me.
I raise my hands and I surrender
I don't wanna resist 'cause your touch and your kiss
Have shattered my defenses,
I surrender.

I have to admit that I...
I never thought I'd need someone this way
'Cause you open my eyes so that I...
I could see so much more.

I've always made it on my own,
I've always thought that I would keep control.
You changed everything I believe in
And now I just can't fight this feeling baby.

I raise my hands and I surrender
(I surrender, baby)
'Cause your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me.

I raise my hands and I surrender,
I don't wanna resist 'cause your touch and your kiss
Have shattered my defenses,
I surrender...

I surrender to this feeling in my heart,
I surrender to the safety of your arms,
To the touch of your lips,
To the taste of your kisses.

I raise my hands and I surrender
(Oh baby, baby...)
'Cause your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me.

I raise my hands and I surrender
(Oh baby, baby...)
'Cause your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without you...
I surrender...

I raise my hands and I surrender
'Cause your love is too strong and I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me
I surrender, baby.

I can't pretend anymore,
I can't lie to myself that I'm not always thinking of you.
