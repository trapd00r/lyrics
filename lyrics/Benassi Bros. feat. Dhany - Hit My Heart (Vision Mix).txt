Are you gonna hit my heart 
Are you gonna leave me once again 
Baby don´t you hit my heart 
Are you gonna break my heart 
Are you gonna make me cry again  
Baby don´t you break my heart

Hey boy It´s not a game 
You are the one to blame 
My love is not your toy 
You better be careful boy 

You told a million lies to me 
One day you said goodbye baby 
I gave you one more chance
So be still be baby 
(REFRAIN) 
Are you gonna hit my heart 
Are you gonna leave me once again 
Baby don´t you hit my heart 
Are you gonna break my heart 
Are you gonna make me cry again 
Baby don´t you break my heart 

I´m not that kinde of girl 
I know what I answer 
My trust in you was wrong darlin 
I won´t  do it anymore 

You swear that you still care for me 
You tell to come in again honey 
But you, It´s always the same 
Won´t you tell me baby 
REFRAIN
