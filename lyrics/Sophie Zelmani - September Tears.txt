There ain't so many people that really can make you cry
And there ain't too many things that really reach you inside
When it happens It feels like we all wanna die
And the best time for answers might be when we cry

Aren't we really really living, when we cry?
Aren't we really really feeling, when we cry?

People might say they don't pray but, still they hope
We hope though we don't belive or when we don't call
And then we die with the hope

Aren't we really really living, when we cry?
Aren't we really really feeling, when we cry?
