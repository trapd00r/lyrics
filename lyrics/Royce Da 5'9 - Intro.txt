I woke up this morning
And decided there's no such thing as me being in my prime
You go ahead and be in yours
I can always improve
I woke up this morning
And decided to always believe in myself
When you an addict it's easy for a motherfucker to just bring you down
You gotta rise above that shit
I woke up this morning
Distraction-free, no naggin'-ass bitches, no beggin'-ass niggas
I wanna go nowhere with you
I wanna drink a fuckin' lean, I'm a grown-ass man
I woke up this morning and decided I don't expect for you to understand my shit
If you're not hip-hop
I woke up this morning
With a clear conscience and a clear mind
I slept well last night
And now that I think about it
Man, I'm just thankful to God that I even woke up this morning
With all the shit that I've been through in my life I'm just thankful to God that I even woke up this morning
Lord, thank you for waking me up this morning
