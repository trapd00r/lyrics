Eminem:
Guess who?
Did you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus

Charmagne:
When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you (who can really blame you) we're the ones who made you

Eminem:
Back by popular demand, now pop a little Zan-tac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic is it grand
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands

Shady man, no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again

Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back, as nasty as he can
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
Now come in girl

Charmagne:
When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you (who can really blame you) we're the ones who made you

Eminem:
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley horse her
Sorry Portia, but whats Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness

Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenedrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend

Brit forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middlemen
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it wont be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention

And little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
Love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim

Charmagne:
When you walked through the door, (whoo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you? (who can really blame you) we're the ones who made you

Eminem:
And that's why my love, you'll never live without
I know you want me girl 'cause I can see you checkin' me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you

Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breast in my mouth (blup)
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin' like Elvis

Lord help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Lookin' like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about ta flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya

Can ya blame me, you're my Amy I'm your Blake
Matter fact, make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it, to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down, girl

Charmagne:
When you walked through the door, (wooo) it was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a - rock star (baby), everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player, (oh) who can really blame you? (who can really blame you) we're the ones who made you

Eminem:
So baby (baby)
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Oh, Amy
Rehab never looked so good
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha-ha, wooo
Dr. Dre, two-thousand and twenty
Yeah
