She was drowned in suicide
Faithless lover cast aside
This is how she came to be
Lorelei of the sea
Hopes destroyed, she wanted to find
Certain death peace of mind
Now you wonder who is she
Lorelei of the sea
Many tales I've been told of sailors having died
After seeing a mermaid known
As Lorelei
Faithless lover that is me
And she siren of the sea
So next time that the seagulls fly
Don't you cry sweet Lorelei

CHORUS:
Seagulls fly
When mermaids cry
Those tears won't dry
For Lorelei

The guilt is mine I was untrue 
The question is what am I to do
All I know is I got to try
Try to find sweet Lorelei
Make amends for what's been done
'Cause I believe that she's the one
And I will go where seagulls fly
Try to find sweet Lorelei

CHORUS

There she is I hear her cry
She's asking me if I will die
There ain't nothing I won't do
For you Lorelei

CHORUS
