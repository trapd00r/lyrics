Don't wanna sound ridiculous
but I think you know I'm sick of this
and I kinda think that we can bend, do you?
I'll try to be a better friend to you
you know I miss ya in my life
and I kinda think that I realise
that I was only lookin' out for me
instead of gettin' you the help you need

who do you think you are?
who do I think I am?
barely listening to my oldest
my oldest friend

oh my oldest, my oldest friend

I've given one, you've taken two
but this medicine has followed you
from the eastern coast and back again
so I tell you once but not again
that I only miss you in my life
and I hope you finally realise
that I'm only looking out for you
when I'm not afraid to see this through

who do you think you are?
who do I think I am?
barely listening to my oldest
my oldest friend

oh my oldest, my oldest friend

So wanna sound ridiculous
'cause I think you know I'm sick of this
and I kinda think that we can bend, do you?
I'll try to be a better friend to you
you know I miss ya in my life
and I kinda think I realise
that I was only lookin' out for me
instead of gettin' you the help that you need

whoa-oh, whoa-oh oooh, whoa-oh oooh
