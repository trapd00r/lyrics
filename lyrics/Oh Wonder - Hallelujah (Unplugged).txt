[Verse: Oh Wonder]
I heard it on the radio
On my way back home
That I'm gonna be someone
I guess it was a song they wrote
Saying, "Don't go slow
'Cause you're gonna be someone"
They were singing, "Hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
I heard it on the radio
On my way back home

[Pre-Chorus: Oh Wonder]
Some days I don't think my mama thinks I'm good enough
To be a superstar
But one day I will show her I'm a diamond in the rough
I'll be a superstar
'Cause there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it
Whether you like it or not
Yeah, there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it
Whether you like it or not

[Chorus: Oh Wonder]
And I'll be singing
"Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
Whether you like it or not
Yeah, I'll be singing
"Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
Whether you like it or not

[Pre-Chorus: Oh Wonder]
Some days I don't think my daddy thinks I'm good enough
To be a superstar
But one day I will show him I'm a diamond in the rough
I'll be a superstar
'Cause there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it
Whether you like it or not
Yeah, there's a crown
Covered in glitter and gold
I'm gonna wear it
Whether you like it or not

[Chorus: Oh Wonder & Choir]
And I'll be singing
"Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
Whether you like it or not
And I'll be singing
"Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
Whether you like it or not

[Verse: Oh Wonder]
I heard it on the radio
On my way back home
That I'm gonna be someone
I guess it was a song they wrote
Saying, "Don't go slow
'Cause you're gonna be someone"
They were singing, "Hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
I heard it on the radio
On my way back home

[Chorus: Oh Wonder]
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah
Whether you like it or not
And I'll be singing
"Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
Whether you like it or not

[Outro: Oh Wonder & Choir]
And I'll be singing
"Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
Whether you like it or not
And I'll be singing
"Halle-halle-halle-halle-hallelujah
Halle-hallelujah"
Whether you like it or not
