Well I'm feeling real sick - who's got the remedy?
My life - under your authority
Can't see straight - no visibility
Break it down - to the first degree

God damn think I lost my head again
Can't stop this way of thinking
God damn think I'm over the edge again
Gotta figure out how to bring myself back from insane

Well you're getting me sick - who's got the remedy?
My life's - no authority
I can't see straight - the dim reality
Break it down to the first degree
