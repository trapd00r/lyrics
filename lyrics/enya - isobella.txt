(English Adaptation
by Roma Ryan 
Out of morning and into midnight,
Through the sunrise and under moonlight.
Isobella, oh!
Isobella, dream of me.

Everything that comes from day
Comes into the heart to stay.
Love is in your name each day.

In the moment you come before me,
In that moment I see you only
Isobella, oh!
Isobella, dream of me.

Everything that comes from night
Comes within your shining light.
Love is in your name each night. )
