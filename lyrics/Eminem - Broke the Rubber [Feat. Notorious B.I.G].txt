[Starts off with the beat of 2Pac & The Notorious B.I.G.'s: "Runnin' (Dying To Live)".]

[Intro: 50 Cent {DJ Whoo Kid}]
Broke ass mothafucka...
Hehahahaha! {Whooooo! }

[Verse: {DJ Whoo Kid}]
Now mutherfucker I take a look at the kid,
Now take a look at the crib.
No! - I Take a look at the car,
I'm a motherfuckin' star!
It's kinda hard for me to practice, cause niggas ain't up to par!
And my paper stretch longer {GOD-... } than Abdul Jabar. {DAMN! }
Get hit with a leaner - and the grib of a lobster
With a pooched screen I gun a man with a chopper.
You played me you musta had a frying pan full of vodka
I rode a bike now I LAND IN A CHOPPER! [shot] {LLOYD BANK$! }
You should keep your head down if you got love for him,
Before you see his ass flying off the roof like Nutso in above the rim! [explode] {Whoooo! }
(50: "AUH! ") The kid is out for the gusto and I love to win (uh-huh!) (GGG!)
Driving the industry nutso I'm a rub it in;
You page me a trial every kid is spoiled (Snffff!)
Smell that nigga? - I just shit it on you! {DAMN! }
I pass bullets so the gun goes with me
And the bullets are the size of Mutumbo's pinky; (uh-huh!) {Whoooo! }
And they automatic which means they unload quickly
I hit these niggas with a Drum-role; 50 they make another song! (go ahead!)
Get a bitch pregnant, wrong! [shot] - I don't trust myself! (uh-uh!)
I walked into the hotel with the rubber on. (Bank$!) (50: "Haha! ")
Then I'm gone...
I ain't playing funny style, cause I ain't selling nobody; yo' shit - I wear my own! [explode]
{Whooooo! } The industry for me, some mutherfucking rap homie
Gimme a cheque of a couple mil. and jet! {NONE STOP! } (yeah!)
See heavy smoking is a thing I do (uh-huh!)
That's why my Weed supply could fill up the pouch on a kangaroo. {Whoooooo! }
We in the club with the daggers and razors too
I'm cool as ice water my earings are laser blue. (bling!)
You should cop a new vest
Cause if I got a tatoo for every nigga that past there wouldn't be room left. (damn!) {Whoohooo! }
And I'll be damned, if I [shot] spend my afternoon stressed,
When my sex partner is 5'9'' with baloon breasts. (go!) {SHADYVILLE! }
Ghost writing is a hobby kid, (uh-huh!)
So if a nigga shit sound like I wrote it I pro'ly did. [explode] (you know you are!)
And you can tell you flopped on your last tour
Cause your dressing room is the size of my bathroom! (haha!)
If I'm at the dealer I ain't browsing I'm buying (uh-huh!)
These rappers can't spend a $100, 000, they lying! (NO!) {Whoooooo! }
Damn near sold 100, 000 you crying! (NO!) - Tell you what!
Here's a Tech, shoot yourself in the neck! {POW! }

[Outro: {DJ Whoo Kid}]
YEAH!
It's Lloyd Bank$, nigga!
G-UUNIT! [shit]
Yaaaayo!
Come on nigga... {G-UNIT ALBUM... OUT NOW! }
