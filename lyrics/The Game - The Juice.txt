You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the

It been 10 years since you heard from niggas on the west side
Now we on the cover of the Vibe
A nigga shot me five times
I'm happy to be alive
And my mama told me
(You got the juice now baby)
My first album went 5 times plat
Looking for California, it was on my back
I was 23 when I had my first kid
And his mama told him when he came out
(You got the juice)
Like father, like son, uh
Top down, Mercedes throttle
Wrist looking like a nigga just played the lotto
I am to Compton what Ye is to Pablo
Run up on the car, just spray with hollows
I grew up in the six-trey Impala
Ain't make the league but I made the dollars
Recording my demo, knew Dre will follow
Remember Eve told me

You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the, you got the, you got the juice now baby

Left the Unit and the world went cray
I blame it on the California mind state
Too much weed, weather, women, chronic seeds, ass, titties
Can a nigga pour his Henny
Without niggas acting fake in his motherfucking face one time
'Fore I pull the .40 up out the waist line
I'm the first Compton nigga Dr. Dre signed
And Mary J told me at baseline
(You got the juice now baby)
Then my second album went plat too
And it was thug life with this Eazy tattoo
But I never forgot where I came from
Or where I got my name from
My grandma told me
(You got the juice now baby)
And here's something I can't forget
My mama brought a nigga up on that LA gangster shit
Your boy ain't never gonna change mama
Here's some change mama and a Range mama
She looked back and said

You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the, you got the, you got the juice now baby
You got the, you got the, you got the juice now baby

So much pressure applied
All this pressure applied
Pray, this pressure applied to our lives
Feels like we gon' bust, feels like we gon' bust
Over gestures you die
Ain't no question that I'm tryna make it out alive
But sometimes
Feels like I'm gon' bust, feels like I'm gon' bust
Feels like I'm gon' bust, yeah, feels like I'm gon' bust, oh
So much pressure applied
All this pressure, I'm fly
Greatest pressure, applied to our lives
We gon' bust, gon' bust
