So much for a movie ending romance,
Revise and rewrite.
I'm uninspired, the script is tired,
The cast is looking at me with murderous minds,
With murderous minds.

I've changed,
But you don't look a shade past the day I met you.
It's all over for me now, don't you see?
Just look at these pictures of me.

And look at me now.
These lines on my face betray me,
They're deeper lately.
Take a look at these bags under my eyes.

These lines on my face betray me,
They're deeper lately.
Take a look at these bags under my eyes.

So much for a movie ending romance,
Revise and rewrite.
The story of my life is plain to read,
In these pictures of me.

And look at me now,
Look at me now,
Look at me now,
Look at me now.
