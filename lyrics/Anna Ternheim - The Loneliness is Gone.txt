Can you keep a secret
I'm just as weak as you
Afraid of living without you
Afraid of dying out of love

It's a new thing I have for you
I'm alone
But the loneliness is gone

Some kind of space we live in
Emptiness grows from inside
On our own we are weightless
With you I stand my ground
Always be better half of me

It's a new thing I have for you
I'm alone
But the loneliness is gone
The loneliness is gone
