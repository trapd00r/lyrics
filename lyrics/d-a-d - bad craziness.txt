Straight out of frame'n'bend out of shape
Nothing's real x-cept the money that we made
Staring at the place where the 2 walls meet
Yeah! - Take a chair'n'have a seat...
Well, I should see it as a brand new start
But I'm all Adams apple'n'a f-f-f-fast beatin' heart
My nerves they twist'n'they jerk
See no drugs will do the work
And I'll tell you for free
How I started stopped bein' me
'Cause you won't believe what I believe when I'm alone
Bad Craziness
I got to tie my head to the TV'n'unplug the phone
Bad Craziness

See the shadows dancing' on the cieling
Say, do you hear what I hear?
Like a TV no one watches
My head's filled with Yeahs'n'Overmuches
Walking trails on my livingroom floor
I feel that life won't be the same as before
Like an x-plorer; lookin' for help
I'd be happy to find myself...
And join the temple of hope
To keep my balance on this globe
'Cause you won't believe what I believe when I'm alone
Bad Craziness
I got to tie my head to the TV'n'unplug the phone
Bad Craziness
I had 2 feet on the ground now I'm almost gone!
B-B-B-Bad Craziness
'Cause you won't believe what I believe when I'm alone
Bad Craziness ...

It's a bird, no a plane, it's a maaan insane!

You won't believe what I believe when I'm alone
Bad Craziness
I got to tie my head to the TV'n'unplug the phone
Bad Craziness
I had 2 feet on the ground; now I'm almost gone
B-B-B-Bad Craziness
Now you won't believe what I believe when I'm alone
Bad Craziness
Bad Craziness
Yeah!
Bad Craziness Bad Craziness
Anything for a good night's sleep
Bad Craziness
I'm counting nightmares instead of sheep
Bad Craziness
'Cause you won't believe what I believe when I'm alone!.
