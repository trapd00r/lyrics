Anyone who ever had a heart, 
should know what is like 
Anyone who ever been in love, 
should know what is like  

I've made up my mind  

'cause it feels like the first time,
I steal a kiss from a stranger, yeah  

Two people shouldn't be alone,
and girl we're running out of time
I've gotta know what's inside
a woman's heart, and inside of mine  

You've made up my mind  

Cos it feels...  

Just emotion away
Just emotion away
