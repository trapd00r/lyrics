The ride of a life time times the static attic vibe is what we provide for yo mind,
so you can step inside and wine and dine upon the lyrical find
that's steady rockin over calibrated fusion divine, hit rewind,
I'm givin ya'll a piece of my mind,
voice in time, and you know the style is f-I-n-e fine, we platinum lined,
all other stars be outshined,
by the 5 up in the pocket jumpin out from behind
The plan I devise will strengthen and strategize on
limitless endeavors to ascend the ladder of lies,
compromise you shouldn't, so realize they wouldn't,
attempt to fill it up so in a different size they put it..
while we on the topic let me get it out right here,
we're simply speakin to you in a format you wanna hear so clear your mind,
relax, the p's got the reins,
multistylamin injection pomeroy into your veins Boom,

it's the double-m ma-double r-o-n,
once again rushin' that adrenaline,
cause when I'm on the mic mc's disband they see guitar
in hand and they be like damn,
this band be blowin the spot and ya'll be knowin they hot
the train is mowing your thought therefore expanding the plot eh,
that's what happens and it ain't gonna stop eh you D,
we gotta gotta drop,

Back in this round two tell me what you're gonna do who me you can't see,
I'm invisible bendin' light like the predator, editor of the bs tip and I'm gon' settle
the words on a page in a rage I construct,
with my fury of though from your pride I deduct,
maximum props cause the blocks will erupt,
as soon as kids out in the street realize your sound is corrupt yo We vibratin' no waitin'
constantly matin with genetic strands of groove and funk,
we fat like bacon and butter over teflon so slippery when we get it on point like allouicious,
very viscous like omegatron bliss pump this,
through your stereo now, don't miss the gist,
shootin up from the sound,
cause mass production of sections of suction orifice connections and lacking lyric injection
can only lead to rejection.

Boom, the who's the had's the what's the bad's the mark's the shad the wig's the fad's,
we pole voltin' ya'll leavin' ya back to all the radio emcee's lickin' they ass, what? 
Chilling effect, slowing ya down shuting you up, a govern mental X-files cover up,
that's what happens and it ain't gonna stop eh yo D, we gotta gotta drop,


In unison breakin' no fakin' for goodness saken, 
shakin' all shoes of wak crews cuz news we be makin' we be changing the time,
rearangin' the shine but the music that we kick is still the absolute high,
P-O-M-E-R-O-Y, the Eskimo pie bring a qwest into ya eye,
people ask us why, the pimpin' nimble superfly, bite our style don't even try NEVER let the music die.
