Now I notice the streetlamp's hum 
The ghosts of graffiti they couldn't quite erase 
The blank-faced stares on the subway as the people go home 
The parks lay empty like my unmade bed 
The streets are silent like my lifeless telephone 
And this is where I live but I've never felt less at home

So I'm not unsympathetic
I see why you left
There's no one to know 
There's nothing to do 
The city's been dead 
Since you've been gone

Sometimes I stand on my roof at night 
And watch as something seems to happen somewhere else 
I feel like the breeze will pick me up and carry me away 
Out and over the iridescent grid 
Up and away from the bar fights and neon lights 
And out and away from everything that makes me what I am

So I'm not unsympathetic 
I see why you left 
There's no one to know 
There's nothing to do 
The city's been dead 
Since you've been gone

Oh I never had just whatever it is you want, baby 
And I really tried, tried and tried with all my might, it made me crazy 
To try to figure out what it is I've done wrong every time when
Everything I love, everything I hold dear 
Heads out sometimes 
All I ever say now is goodbye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
