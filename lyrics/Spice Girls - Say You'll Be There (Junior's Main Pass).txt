Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now, we're going 'round in circles
Tell me will this déjà vu never end, oh
And now you tell me that you're falling in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, eh
This time, you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring
This I swear
And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there

If you put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation
Then I guess I'll have to show you the door

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring
This I swear
And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there

I'm (I'm) giving you everything (I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring (All that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And (And) all that I want from you (All I want from you)
Is a promise (Is a promise you) you'll be there

I'm giving you everything
And all that I want from you
I'm giving you everything
And all that I want from you

I'm (I'm) giving you everything (I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring
Yes, I swear
And (And) all that I want from you (All I want from you)
Is a promise you

I'm
I'll give you everything
All that joy can bring
Yes, I swear
And
All I want from you
Is a promise you

I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring
This I swear

I'm giving you everything
And all that I want from you
