Featuring: Tony Bennett

[Tony]: Steppinâ out with my baby
Canât go wrong âcause Iâm in right
Itâs for sure, not for maybe
That Iâm all dressed up tonight

[Christina]: Steppinâ out with my honey
Canât be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockinâ wood

[Tony]: Thereâll be smooth sailinâ âcause Iâm trimminâ my sails
In my top hat and my white tie and my tails

[Christina]: Steppinâ out with my baby
Canât go wrong âcause Iâm in right
Ask me when will the day be

[Tony]:The big day may be tonight.

[Tonny]: If I seem to scintillate
Itâs because Iâve got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love

[Christina]: You donât have to ask me
I wonât waste your time

[Tony]: But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime, go

[Christina]: Thereâll be smooth sailinâ 
âcause Iâm trimminâ my sails
In my top hat and my white tie and my tails

[Tony]: Steppinâ out with my baby
Canât go wrong âcause Iâm in right
Ask me when will the day be

[Together]: The big day may be tonight., what a night!
