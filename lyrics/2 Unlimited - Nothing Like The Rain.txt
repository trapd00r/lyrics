Wou-ou, yeah yeah
Nothing like the rain
Yeah, check it out y'all
Nothing like the rain
Nothing like the rain
There's nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
To come and wash away, away the pain

Let me ask a question
Where do we go from here
Playing games to past the time, that's ok
'Cause time is on our side

There's nothing like the rain
Falling down again
To come and wash away the pain
There's nothing like the rain
Falling down again
To clear the air so we see again

Falling down again

If I make promise
I'll never let you down, no no
Love will always brake your heart, so they say
But we can turn that around
Oh baby
There's nothing like the rain
Falling down again
To come and wash away the pain
There's nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
To clear the air so we see again

And we won't give up
We won't give up
No we won't give in
Check it out y'all
When there's so much we can do
So much left to do
And we won't give up,
We won't give up
No we won't give in
When there is so much left to do

So much left to do, oh yeah
It's there- Can you feel it
A chance to change your world if you want it
You can give up a lot, but don't give in
Be ready for the break when it comes your way
Today I say, hey, be prepared
A break in the clouds, you will be heard
Raise your voice, stake your claim
After the storm, after the rain

There's nothing like the rain
Falling down again
To come and wash away the pain
There's nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain
To clear the air so we see again

And we won't give up
(We won't give up!)
No we won't give in
(We won't give in!)
When there is so much we can do
(Yeah, check it out yo)
And we won't give up
(We won't give up)
No we won't give in
(We won't give in)
When there is so much left to do

And we won't give up
(We won't give up)
No we won't give in
(Check it out ya)
When there is so much we can do
(So much left to do)
And we won't give up
No we won't give in
(No we won't give up)
When there is so much left to do

Nothin' like the rain, nothin' like the rain
Nothin' like the rain, nothin' like the rain
(Whispered:) Nothin' like the rain
