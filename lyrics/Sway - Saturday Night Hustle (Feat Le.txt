[Verse: Sway]
Living through the first, first, first
Getting up at 6 really hurts, hurts, hurts
But once I take shower I'm alert, lert, lert
I'm living proof that prayer really works, works, works
I never knew how much my words were worth
Until he brought me onto this earth earth earth
People listen to me because I work work work
Put on my jean plus which ever shirt works works
Then I'm

[Verse: Sway]
I'm so bloody fresh, so damn fly
In my imagine I'm the - guy
Some of these other rappers only rock it because I
Brought it to their forefront, brought it to their eye
Now alot of other friends try to holla at me
Wanting to give me, their clothes for free
When I'm L in a jacket in XL in a Tee
My puma's size 11 shoes 43
38 long (that's in the jeans)
My structure be strong (that's in my jeans)
Cashew machine
Catch my on stage scratching my (uhh oh)
Yeah and I'm so G'd up, I do this with my eye's closed and my feet up
And my hands tied balencing a tea cup
On the tip of my nose you rappers could never keep up

[Verse: Sway]
Yeah I'm a keep it real, a kid with out a deal
A rapper generated a quarter of a mil, just a second down chill
I ain't reach peak yet, still shine on the bill
With max keen a deal, max pain I am
I came to bang,
Not chase the groupies, I chase the grands
Rap pays my man, backstage I am
Nervous til I think of that great?, back pains my man
Untils I get old I says I am the best
So that says I am
I'm a alot, and I got more balls then camlet
When I'm on then your whole set dips like camlet
Plus I'm a boss I'm a boss, I claim I am
Camera on camera off
I'm the same my man
Can't be stopped until I'm off
I'm same I'm a keep improving, digital of analog I'm keep it moving

Ahhh ha
