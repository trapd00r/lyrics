Standing at a corner
You only make it worse 'cos you never try
Why don't you show me?
You'd better move it
You're getting on my nerves, getting nothing done

Hey, I wanna see some action
Or is it me you're waiting for

When you're down and out
Get it right
Get on up
For another round
Don't look back
And don't look down
Get your act together
Get it right

I thought I knew you
And all your troubles
Have you never had a set- back until now?
Should have warned me
Your split decisions
Make me fall apart every single time
