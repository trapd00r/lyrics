Deadly ace corn beef, stage thief's, base steal
Rewind it back, reference standard, reunited and stamps
Means of way to leave out-outta loud
Cost in love to lose in wings lost in the wind

Beam the pedal, make the radio, sit the glass row
Pay the patrol, raise the petrol
Keep the gas slow, wheel's the parol
Laid none is about the shit that reck key life
Lane aside on a mellow
Steerin' down on A and gear low
Being know about to go, get the dough and pimp di(?)sease life

Buried other days, they try to stay in touch
At least but i stay under the butt
