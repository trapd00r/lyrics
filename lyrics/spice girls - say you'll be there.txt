Oh, say you'll be there

I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring
This I swear

Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now, we're going 'round in circles
Tell me will this déjà vu never end? Oh

And now you tell me that you're falling in love
Well, I never ever thought that would be, eh
This time, you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'm giving you everything 
All that joy can bring 
This I swear (I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you 
Is a promise you will be there
(Say you will be there, ow)
(Say you will be there)
(Won't you sing it with me?)

If you put two and two together 
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation 
Then I'll guess I'll have to show you the door

There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid

I'm (I'm) giving you everything (I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring (All that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And (And) all that I want from you (All I want from you)
Is a promise you (Is a promise you)
Will be there
Yeah, I want you

Any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

I'll give you everything, on this I swear
Just promise you'll always be there

I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (All that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (All that I want from you) 
Is a promise you (I want you to promise to)
Will be there  (Always be there)

I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (All that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (All that I want from you) 
Is a promise you (I want you to promise to)
Will be there (Always be there)

I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (All that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (All that I want from you) 
Is a promise you (I want you to promise to)
Will be there
