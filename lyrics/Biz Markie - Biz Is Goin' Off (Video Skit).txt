"I! - am the magnificent..."
{*Biz beatboxes a scale, repeating the last note*}
"I! - am the magnificent..."
{*Biz: BOOM, ah one two, ah one two - followed by clicks*}
"I'm the {?} most honored, storied, sound of soul!"
{*Cool V scratches: "Go off, go off!"*}

(Verse One)
Hey to everybody and, people that say partyin
It's time to hear a funky rhyme from me the Biz Markie again
As I just display 'em, the way I like say 'em
The stutter steppin style that I use to amuse and HEY
I'm the original, hellified king-ing
For freaky sound, for throwin' down, and you know that I'm bringing
The crowd to enjoyment, by what I do
Like {*ah-oww-oww WAHHAZOOW, boom, ah one two*}
I keep the people cheerin, because of what they hearin
Movin and groovin, to a devestatin sound that's glarin
Because they're in the mood for me
The B-I-Z the Emmezah-Emmezah-A-R-K-I-E
The party rippin, never trippin', king of crowd pleasin
I can turn it out without a doubt in any season


I entertain crowds, a million and thous'
Homeboys makin' noise, as I do browse through a girl's blouse
Say the funky rhyme to make the girls get naked
I can turn it out, with different sounds on my record
That I say give 'em, as y'all exault the rhythm
The magnificent record maker of Prism

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin' off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin' off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin' off
The Biz {*"Go off, go off!"*}

(Verse Two)
Ha ha ha ha ha! Check out this bizarre
Rappin' style used by me, the B-I-Z
Emm-A-R-K-I with the E and, you will be agreein
A brother ain't a brother unless he is say like G'n
Up with his technique and, keep the people freakin
Like me the B
