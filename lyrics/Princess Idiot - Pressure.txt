[Verse 1: Verbal]
She's an ice princess, and I confess that
I'm impressed she could be so cold
She don't know that I envy that
And if she ever left me, she could get me back
She's an ice princess, and I'm convinced that
I'm her prince, baby, please, don't go
She don't know that she got a spell on me
And if I left her, she wouldn't dwell on me
She's an ice princess, and I'm convinced that
Every day that passes, she likes me less
But she loves me more, she must be torn
Like the gown that she wears, there must be thorns
In the crown that she wears, she must be scorn
She must be sore from the burden that she bears, bears
And all the pressure that she carries
Arms tired from the treasure that she buried
Ice princess, should I get dressed to
Getting that bath tub and give you a back rub, love?
She tried to hit me, but she missed me (missed me)
And then she kissed me like she missed me
Ice princess, I'm convinced that
Every day that passes, she likes me less
But she loves me more, she must be torn
Like the gown that she wears, she must have thorns
In the crown that she wears

[Hook]
I found the way
I found the way further, the way further
I found the way
I found the way further

[Verse 2: Verbal]
She must be scorn
Must have been born with a flower in her hair, hair
And a sparkle in her eye
So cold, tears harden when she cries
She's an ice princess that dyes her lips a
Certain shade of blue with the wine she sips
And I kiss her, like I'm the only one who gets her
But everybody wants her, my little ice sculpture
Ice princess, 'bout 5'6
With a four-inch heels, giving me the chills
Cool, like the other side of a pillow
Waiting for me to come and climb in her window
Ice princess, since I invest
All my time in her, I've been writing less, but
Writing better, twice as clever
And that's why I had to go and write this letter
Dear ice princess

[Hook]
I found the way
I found the way further, the way further
I found the way
I found the way further

[Outro: Verbal]
Ice princess, can I confess that
I'm impressed you could be so cold
You don't know that I envy that
And if you ever left me, you could get me back
You're an ice princess, and I'm convinced that
I'm your prince, baby, please, don't go
All I know is you got a spell on me
And if I left you, you wouldn't dwell on me
She's an ice princess
