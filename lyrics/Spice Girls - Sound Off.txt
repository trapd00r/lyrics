We're the Spice Girls, yes indeed
Just girl power is all we need
We know how we got this far
Strength and courage and a wonderbra

Could this work with only one?
Just with me, I'd have no fun
Would this work with only two?
We need more for what we do

Would this work with only three?
Three's a crowd, bad company
Would this work with only four?
No way girl, we need one more

Listen up, take my advice
We need five for the power of Spice
Give it up!
Give it out!
Take a stand!
Better shout!

1-2-3-4-5 Spice Girls!
