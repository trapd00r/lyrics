Untouched I'm not lying I'll snipe you faster than a nigga that's been caught wired I start processes minalical alenal, freeze mixed wit vykinen and make a hell of addidoe speak unrelevent leave enough medicine that can stop me from swelling your mouths, worse than telekents I can sock whores that's wit enough force to crack the back of their, skeletons fuck having remarshalled, be better off being suicidal and four fitten look it how's your horseman but not they final organs, snitches are foe and when they see me "folks are quick to point their fingers
