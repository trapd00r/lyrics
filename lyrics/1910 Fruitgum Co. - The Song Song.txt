I got love in my tummy and I feel like a-lovin' you
Love, you're such a sweet thing, good enough to eat thing
And it's just a-what I'm gonna do

Ooh love to hold ya, ooh love to kiss ya
Ooh love I love it so, oh love you're sweeter
Sweeter than sugar

Kind-a sounds funny but your love honey
And honey, I love you
