There's a place where a kid without a cent 
He can grow up to be president
A magic kingdom filled with Barbie dolls
If you've got the time we can make it a good time

Americanos - Blue Jeans and Chinos
Coke
Pepsi and Oreos - Americanos
Movies and heroes in the land of the free
You can be what you wanna be

They know how to advertise
Sell you anything at any price
Need it or not
That's what you got, yeah
Take no bull from anyone
We just wanna have some fun
We got the Queen of Soul
Created to Rock'n Roll, yeah!

Americanos - Blue Jeans and Chinos
Coke
Pepsi and Oreos - Americanos
Low riding Chicanos in the land of the free
You can be what you wanna be

Satellite stations across the nation
That's cable TV for you and me
I'm cleaning kitchens
Washing pots and pans
Everything's organized from crime to leisure time
High schools and swimming pools
King sharks and fools
