"Get It Right"
(feat. Precise)

[Precise]
Morning
Some of y'all may think 
That this next track
A little risky for a Luther joint
But all you gotta do is listen to get it
Get it right
Alright, ch'all, lets start from number one
And get down till it's done

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu
The Pre to the C-I-S-E do

[Luther]
Let's get this thing to workin'
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start it
We all could use the change

[1] - Do it till we get it, get it right
Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right
Do it till we get it
Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

[Precise]
Get all up in your back and down your spine
Got to keep it on track like the A train line
To the junction out in Brooklyn
What's your function
Keep you lookin' once again
As I punch in those lines like the SV-1200
Precise on the mic, you
But we gon' get top shot at the party
Started rockin'
And I got first dibs on the dark skinned kid

[Luther]
And I know just how to do it
To make it really nice
There's no mystery to it
Do it till you get it right

[Repeat 1]

[2] - Feels so good to get it
Get it
It's so good to get it
Get it, get it right
Feels so good to get it
Get it
It's so good to get it
Get it, get it right

And oh, don't give up now
We can make it, we can take it right to the top
Come on and never stop
Oh, and let's reach for the sky
And if we keep believing we can never go too high
Why don't we give it a try
Come on and keep reaching up
And don't you worry
No, you won't use up your stuff
No way to get enough
Do it till we get it right
And even if it takes from morning till way into night
We got to

[Repeat 1]

Till we get it
Ain't no doubt, "Cise" is gonna turn it out
Do it till we get it
Stay with it and get it right
Never stop, Luther take ya to the tpo
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

[Precise]
How y'all feeling tonight
Better hold on tight
Throw your hands in the air If you're getting it right
What we got you'll like
But it's not quite the regular jam
Luther and Precise
How y'all feeling tonight
Better hold on tight
Throw your hands in the air if you're getting it right
What we got you'll like 
But it's not quite your regular jam
Luther and Precise

[Repeat 2]
