Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause I'm driving home to you
A terrible song on the radio
Babe, what else is new?

You don't want to talk
You don't want to touch
You don't even wanna watch TV
You say I can't see the forest for the trees
So burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause God knows where I've been
Officer please, don't check my breath
That ain't my only sin

You don't want to talk
You don't want to touch
You don't even wanna watch TV
If you can't see the forest for the trees
Just burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all of the wreckage
When we met, you'd never expect this
And you said, maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
We don't deserve
We don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause I'm driving home to you
Terrible song on the radio
Baby, what else is new?
Been hiding my scars in broad daylight bars
Behind laugh tracks on TV
If you can't see the forest for the trees
Just burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all the wreckage
When we met you'd never expect this
And you say, maybe we don't deserve love
Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all the wreckage
When we met you'd never expect this
And you say, maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
We don't deserve
We don't deserve love
(We don't deserve love)

Mary, roll away the stone
The man that you love
Always leave you alone
Well go on Mary
Roll away the stone
The man you love always leave you alone
You hear your mother screaming
You hear your daddy shouting
You try to figure it out
You never figured it out
Your mother's screaming
That you don't deserve love
If you don't deserve love
And if I don't deserve love
Could we deserve?
Come down off your cross
And tell me!
It's always the Christ-types
Mary, roll away the stone
The one that you love
Always gonna leave you alone
Particularly the Christ-types
Mary, roll away the stone
The one you love
Always leave you alone
It's always the Christ-types
You're waiting on
