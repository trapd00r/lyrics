Oriental!
Hey-ho!
She's gonna be there climbing the stair
Flag waving up in the air
She's gonna be there, jungle somewhere

And boy - take your eyes away from her
And boy - lay them on another girl
She's a teaser Japanese
She's a teaser Japanese
She's a teaser Japanese
And boy - you're gonna get burned

Queen of arts!
Hey-ho!
Eyes of black meet eyes of blue
Beast and beauty, wave goodbye
Sayonara moon up in the sky

And boy - take your eyes away from her
And boy - lay them on another girl
She's a teaser Japanese
She's a teaser Japanese
She's a teaser Japanese
And boy - you're gonna get burned

Hey-ho!
