Sit down by my table
I'll let you sit lonely
If you've got a question
You are free to ask

If I had met you
When you still were growing
And not after all stories
And when you already
Have lived your life

I would have known
About your ferrows
And maybe about your loving
I could have seen in your eyes
If we had lost it yet

How different
It would have been
To have something to say
How good I would feel
To be with you today

Sit down by the table
Drink the wine
That's been aging
Lose your head into something
I'll be quiet
Like an old friend

How different
It would have been
To have something to say
How good I would feel
To be with you today
