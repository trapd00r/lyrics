If you want my love so fine
Sweet as heaven so divine
Close your eyes
It's me you'll find
Deep inside your dreams tonight

You won't have to kick and fight
To know my love feels oh so right
When you think I'm out of sight
I'll be deep inside your dreams tonight

You won't have to travel
On a moonbeam or a star
Or a rocket ship to Mars

Don't become unravelled
If you think I'm very far away
Come close I'll say

You don't have to feel uptight
Or make a wish with all your might
Just think of me and shut the lights
I'll be deep inside your dreams tonight
Deep inside your dreams tonight
