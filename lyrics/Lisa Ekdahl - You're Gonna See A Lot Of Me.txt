I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you
I'll make you love me, wait and see
Both day and night and night and day
You're gonna see a lot of me

I'm gonna haunt you, I'm gonna haunt you
Oh what a pest I'm gonna be
Both day and night and night and day
You're gonna see a lot of me

I'll be the spoon in your coffee
The knife that butters your bread
If I sound a little bit off it
That's because because because
you've gone to my head

If you're in China, I'll go to China
I'll never never let you free
Both day and night and night and day
You're gonna see a lot of me
