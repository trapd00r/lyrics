How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough
To know when it's time
Time to let go

Sing

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I ask for a sign
>From a sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

Oh, I can not hide the way I feel inside
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
If I gave you one more try
To these rules will you abide
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

Life is too short
To be tryin' to play some games
Take some time and you think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way
Why do you have to play
With my mind all the time

Sing
Ooh just help me sing it
