What would you say if I asked of you
- out of loneliness, out of loneliness
What would you say if I asked of you
- out of loneliness, out of loneliness
Could I be with you
Can I be with you

It's warm inside the night club
Your face is lit up by a disco light
I don't want to go home alone, not tonight
I have a picture of a man who used to sit in that chair
I will go anywhere
Just as long as I'm with someone
You will do, just take me home for tea

If I told you my stories and sang you my songs
Would you laugh at me
Would you pity me
What would you say if I asked of you
Not out of accident, out of loneliness
Would you shelter me
Will you shelter me

I will be gone when you wake up
No awkward breakfasts, I swear
And don't you look for me, because I could be anywhere
In someone else's house
In someone else's arms
With someone else to warm the pain away

What can I ask of you
What would you want from me
What would you say if I just fell asleep
