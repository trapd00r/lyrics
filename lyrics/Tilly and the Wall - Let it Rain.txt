"Get into the groove boy you've got to prove your love to me"
Played on the radio as we drove down south to see our families
You were lying there in the passenger chair sound asleep
I could recall a time when evenings were bright and thick with love
And all the city streets and their lights they were so mysterious
Oh life it was so wonderful it would shine just like fire
How we sat on the backs of our cars and laughed into the morning
I thought you'd come and go
I never thought you would stay
And I'm sorry if I tried to push you away
But the edges they fold and you suddenly find you are buried beneath
A blanket of snow you had no idea was even falling
Now you're sitting on a ouch inside your home feeling cold
Mothing is clear, all your thoughts they have become so hard to find
With a question mark always slumped at the end of these awkward lines
All the simple words we loved to speak are no longer audible
And I never thought with you and I this would be possible
I can feel the world coming apart
And I need you by my side with your delicate heart
So please don't leave me no don't you run
Don't be frightened by the storm so bold and brave
Just let it rain
