I don’t understand why I’m leaving you
I don’t understand what I’m doing
Must follow what has gone from you
Over sea it is moving

I don’t know what’s gonna meet me there
I don’t know where I’m going
All I find is that my heart’s not here
If I stay, you’ll be lonely

The sail got wind in it and
I need to see where it goes
Yes the wind took my sail, and I
Need to go where it blows

I don’t understand how I can be leaving you
I could not see that happen
Yesterday my world was to love you
But now something
Took my heart on the shipping

The sail got wind in it and
I need to see where it goes
Yes the wind took my sail, and I
Need to go where it blows
