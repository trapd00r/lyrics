"So many people around me

Seem to fell so lost and alone

Someone's always forgotten

Tell me why, why must it be so

But someone up there

Must have seen me and decided

"Now it's her turn"


My turn to meet someone

Who knows what I need

It looks like my lonely days

Are finally over


Cos' you're my ticket to heaven

You're my angel of love

Darling, stars explode when I'm moving

Close to you, yes it's true

And I just can't get enough

When you take me to heaven with you


I've been searching all over

You've been here, right here all along

And God knows where I'd be

If you hadn't set me free

With a love so deep and strong

I'd been living like a leaf in a storm

Never knew love so warm

Until I landed in your arms


Baby, you are my lucky star

My four-leaf clover

It looks like my lonely days

Are finally over


Cos' you're my ticket to heaven

You're my angel of love

Baby, stars explode when I'm moving

Close to you, yes it's true

And I just can't get enough

When you take me to heaven with you


You're my angel of love

Baby, stars explode when I'm moving

Close to you, yes it's true


Ticket to heaven baby

You're my angel of love

Moving, close to, close to you
