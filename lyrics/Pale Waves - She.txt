My baby don't touch me like they used to
Should I dare change my hair?
Is it the clothes I wear?
I was fine living my life just kissing you
Thought we could be so much more than this

Are you getting off with someone else?
Don't you lie, I can tell
Does she make you feel as good as I do?

I take my clothes off
I'm just staring at myself
You wasn't satisfied enough
So you fucked somebody else
I feel pathetic in so many ways
How can you just stop loving me in a matter of days?
You're breaking my heart, babe

Are you getting off with someone else?
Don't you lie, I can tell
Does she make you feel as good as I do?
Are you getting off with someone else?
Don't you lie, I can tell
Does she really taste as good as I do?
(Does she really taste as good as I do?)

Are you getting off with someone else?
Don't you lie, I can tell
