I haven't seen your face round since I was a kid
You're bringing back those memories of the things that we did
You're hanging round and climbing trees, pretending to fly
D'Yer wanna be a spaceman and live in the sky?

You got how many bills to pay and how many kids?
And you forgot about the things that we did
The town where we're living has made you a man
And all of your dreams are washed in the sand

Well, it's alright, it's alright
Who are you and me to say what's wrong and what's right?
Do you still feel like me? (do you feel like me?)
We sit down here and we shall see (we shall see)
We can talk and find common ground (common ground)
And we can just forget about feeling down (ah)
We can just forget about life in this town

It's funny how your dreams change as you're growing old
You don't wanna be no spaceman, you just want gold
All the dream stealers are lying in wait
But if you wanna be a spaceman, it's still not too late

Well, it's alright, and It's alright
Who are you and me to say what's wrong and what's right?
Do you still feel like me? (feel like me?)
We sit down here and we shall see (we shall see)
We can talk about common ground (common ground)
And we can just forget about feeling down (ah)
We can just forget about life in this town
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)

Ah (Ah)
