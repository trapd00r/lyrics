Dancin' and movin'
Just keep your body groovin'
Rock it and shake it
Just let your body make it... x4

Did you ever think about my love
When you're not there
When you just walk walk walk away

I know why it happened to me
I broke my promise
Sets me free
Open your eyes and you'll see oh my life
Baby take me forever together tonight

Did you ever think about my love
When you're not there
When you just walk walk walk away

I know why it happened to me
I broke my promise
Sets me free
Over the night oh I'm searching for life
Baby we are together together tonight
