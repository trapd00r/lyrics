{Verse 1: RatedXT}
I been up next (next)
I been tryna' flex (yuh)
Balling so hard (hard)
Feeling convexed (VEX)
I need that new deck
Her pussy so wet (wet)
Hard in that bitch (Bitch)
Like im dipset (ayy yuh)

Ain't trynna hit yet
Ain't give her dick yet
I'm feeling burned out
Like a cigarette

Been the best in Raleigh, now its garner
I'm fucking yo bitch, im such a charmer
Kill your whole team like Jeffrey dahmer
I ain't gonna stop, until i conquer

I'm o.d and i'm o.t
Wrist froze, neck cold like some ac (burr)
I fucking hate me
As of lately
I been trynna stack my money like mcgrady
Or maybe K.D, or William Macy
I ain't gonna stop till the reaper make me

[Chorus]
Tryna' go worldwide hoe ( you know)
Tryna' make our dreams go go (oh oh)
We ain't gonna stop no no
Always motivated let's go
Essketit

Wrist and my fit stay fitted
Whole team get cream, stay wit it
And we ain't gonna stop till we get it
Yeah, We ain't gonna stop till we get it

[Verse 2: Neal]
I'm a young nigga
Finna' take my shot
Don't get in my way, or you'll get popped
I don't wanna flop with this hip hop
So I gotta grind hard, make my rhymes hard

Saw my momma' cry, so i hopped in the driver side of the rap game
Damn it's a shame
Your song ain't got soul, when you chase fame
I'm a young nigga, rap for fun

So call me lame if you want to
My style unique like a shitzu
I shit on you, with these racks, these stacks
This stack of cash I got here relaxing at my pad
While you sit here on yo' ass
Mad cause you running outta cash

I'm gonna smoke this grass and let the time pass
As this money grow
Keep yo' hoe
I'm the one that got a loyal chick in the cover
You would jug my rhymes
Worldwide catch me in London, in the foreign
On the driver side

[Chorus]
Tryna' go worldwide hoe ( you know)
Tryna' make our dreams go go (oh oh)
We ain't gonna stop no no
Always motivated let's go
Essketit

Wrist and my fit stay fitted
Whole team get cream, stay wit it
And we ain't gonna stop till we get it
Yeah, We ain't gonna stop till we get it
