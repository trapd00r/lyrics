I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop them
Quickest damn gunslingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9"

Eminem
I don't speak
I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person
I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room
Possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said

Royce da 5'9"
Yo, who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic
Whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kiss the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is helly
Getting treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man
Disgrace the race of a atheist
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a Patriot
One track sliced without swords
I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay overworked
It's like the Nazis and the Nation collaborating
Attempting to take over the Earth

Eminem
'Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Royce da 5'9": Shit, me neither
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
Royce da 5'9": He's insane
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
'Cause I can't find a decent vein

Royce da 5'9"
The disaster with dreads
I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny
Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred
Man until they joint chains
While slipping bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on the flag and burn it
Murder you, then come to your funeral
Service lobby, and strangle your body to confirm it
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze
Dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs
Somehow MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough to cast a avalanche
And bust 'til volcanoes erupt

Eminem
Hello? (Billy?)
Hey yo what's up? (We're coming to get you)
Stop, they know it's us
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well I'm out now (Shit)
And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up
And I ain't gone leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three 'shrooms
And you won't see me
Like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

Royce da 5'9"
'Cause this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful
See you in Hell for the sequel
Eminem: We'll be waiting
See you in Hell
Wall Street
Eminem: Dope
Royce da 5'9"
Slim Shady
See you in Hell for the sequel
Eminem: Bye-bye
Bad Meets Evil
What?
Eminem: Until next time

Jeff Bass
And so that's the story of when Bad Meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on to this day
Shush
Wait, d'y'all hear that?
