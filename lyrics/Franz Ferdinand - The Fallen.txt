So they say you're troubled, boy
Just because you like to destroy
All the things that bring the idiots joy
Well, what's wrong with a little destruction?

And the Kunst won't talk to you
'Cause you kissed St. Rollox adieu
'Cause you robbed a supermarket or two
Well, who gives a damn about the profits at Tesco?

Did I see you in a limousine?
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened?
Turn the rich into wine as you walk down the mean
Well, the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us, never judge us
Yeah, we're all...

Up now and get 'em, boy
Up now and get 'em, boy
Drink to the devil 
And death to the doctors!

Did I see you in a limousine?
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened?
Well, five thousand users fed today
Oh as you feed us, won't you lead us
To be blessed

So we stole and drank champagne
On the seventh seal, you said you never feel pain
"I never feel pain, won't you hit me again?
I need a bit of black and blue to be in rotation."

In my blood, I feel the bubbles burst
There was a flash of fist, an eyebrow burst
You've a lazy laugh and a red white shirt
I fall to the floor, fainting at the sight of blood

Did I see you in a limousine?
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened?
Turn the rich into wine, walking the mean
Be they Magdalene or virgin- you've already been
You've already been and we've already seen
That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us, never judge us 
To be blessed

La la la la la la la

So, I'm sorry if I ever resisted
I never had a doubt that you ever existed
I only have a problem when people insist on
Taking their hate placing it on your name

So they say you're troubled, boy
Just because you like to destroy
You are the word, the word is 'destroy'
I break this bottle and think of you fondly

Did I see you in a limousine?
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened?
To the whore in a hostel or the scum of a scheme
Turn the rich into wine, walking the mean
It's not a jag in the arm, it's a nail in the beam
On this barren Earth, you scatter your seed
Be they Magdalene or virgin, you've already been
Yeah, you've already been
And we've already seen that the-

Whoo hoo
Whoo hoo
(x4)

You've already been, we've already seen
That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us
Oh, if you judge us
We're all damned
