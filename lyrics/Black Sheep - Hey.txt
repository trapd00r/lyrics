Hey, are you going to that place again
Why can't you stay at home
We all miss you everyday, do you feel all alone

Will I see you in heaven next time I call
You could be my seven if you don't fall
I can see it coming

Do you feel all alone?
I could be what you need

Hey you, what you gonna do
Why can't you leave this place
You can go somewhere else, so you could find your way

Every night you pray and lay your eyes away
Because you feel and I know, you wanna feel it too
You're nothing in between
Get away, you got your attitude, I'm sure you feel it too
The only thing you want is to not be alone, I can see it coming
