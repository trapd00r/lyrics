I'm just calling to say that finally I've lost countingOn how many broken dreams and wasted hours waitingWith a feeling of being somewhere to fill the spaceJust to leave once again knowing you're still hesitatingNo for an answer was not what I was hoping forI'm sure I could have taken it if you had told me beforeI dressed up in armour to dare follow you homeNow I let you believeMy nerves are out of steel and my heart out of stoneSick of the dips and the kicks and what comesWith the price of your companyKisses won't stick and like water praisings run off of meDoing whatever I please as if you were serving a royaltyWhen you say I'm sweet with my needs all I hear is you pityingWaking up in the middle of comedy and tragedyDesperately trying to spot some kind of loyaltyIs it all in my mind is it dragons and demons and fantasiesThat your righteous ambitions would only be phrases and charity
