Maybe it was no one's fault
I know it wasn't mine
And now that you've moved along
I guess I'm next in line

I thought we had the same ideas
But you, you proved me wrong
I've been played the fool before
But never for quite so long

So what now? Do we shake hands
And go our separate ways?
Or do I open my mind
And follow you into the haze?

No, I'll see you tomorrow
Same channel, same time, same place
I'm not going anywhere
'Cause I quit your fucking race

Betray

Goddammit, we were supposed to stay young
And now it's over, it's finished, it's done
Normal expectations, they were on the run
But now it's over, it's finished, it's done

It's over, it's finished, it's done
The end
