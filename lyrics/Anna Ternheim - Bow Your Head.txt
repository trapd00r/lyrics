Let's give it up for the rain
Heavy fall and a halo
Hours of holding the time
Like a stone in the palm of your hand
Lovely days by your side
Not even once, I never saw signs of trouble

Bow your head
Bow your head

Let's give it up for the fool
Words falling carelessly
Each joke holds a belief
For sad people like you and me

Bow your head
Bow your head
Bow your head
For all the loveliness
Let's take a walk on the beach
Feel the sand beneath our feet
Fall asleep in the shade
After a swim in the ocean
Get dry on sandy rocks
Not even once, I never saw
Signs of trouble

Bow your head
Bow your head
Bow your head
For all the loveliness
