If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no you can't disguise

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand there's a reason why
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart let's give it a try

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, no you can't disguise
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you

So tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me, tell me
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
Can't disguise
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
