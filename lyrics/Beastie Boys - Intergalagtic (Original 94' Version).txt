Well, I'm intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

Well the spice is the worm and the worm is the spice
I'll battle any alien when I'm on the mic
Like the Great Gazoo when I'm on the one
I phase motherfuckers when my mic's on stun
Satellite dish, spaceship communications
Gravity bonin', space fornication (yeah)
I'm getting stupider, when I'm on Jupiter
On Uranus, and that's just heinous
And my name is Mike D and
The first man on the moon with the three wood teeing
I was suspended in animation just the other day
Well I was in the night kitchen on the Milky Way
Because I'm getting funky with dilithium crystals
Lieutenant Uhura! *this is Kissel*

Warning! Warning!
We have intruders on sector G-7, level 9. Warning!

Now I'mma break it down with the Dr. Spock shit
Pinch ya buck naked leave ya in the cockpit
I'm like the cover of Jimmy Smith's 'Stay Loose'
Well I be breakin' in space in my gravity shoes
I got tickets to Interzone, so won'tcha beam me up
Hurricane's in orbit with *the scratchin' cuts*
I do-doodle on the paper like my name was scheme
Your galaxy is my bombin' theme
Well I'm worth your while, while you're while I'm worth
*Planet Rhymeon is my place of birth*

I fall like Shawn Kemp from the Supersonics
I got the coded double kick with the phat catonics
I'll be in the crator and you know I slapped it

Planetary, intergalactic

Battlestar one, in G-Son
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone

So Mario, rock the universe
So Hurricane, rock the universe
So Money Mark, rock the universe
So Bobo, rock the universe
So Awol, rock the universe
And everyone, rock the universe
And everyone, rock the universe
And everyone
