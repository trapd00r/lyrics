Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin' but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep (Oh, oh, oh)
Crazy, but it feels all right
Baby thinking of you keeps me up all night

Oh, oh, oh

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep (Oh, oh, oh)
Crazy, but it feels all right
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels all right
Every day and every night

You drive me crazy (You drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep (Oh, oh, oh)
Crazy (You make me feel all right)
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy (You drive me crazy, baby)
Yeah-eah, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
Crazy, but it feels all right (You make me feel all right)
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
