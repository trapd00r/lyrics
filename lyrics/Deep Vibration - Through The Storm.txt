When I look into your spirit
And the spirit never lies
There's a feeling that I can't explain
Deep inside, deep inside

Feels like I've known you forever
Since the origin of time
I've been with you in eternity
In my mind, in my mind

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride

You and I on Earth together
Can't you see it's no surprise
I know it from the first second babe
As I looked in your eyes

I could only dream of heaven
When I gaze into the sky
But I know I found my angel here
In this life, in this life

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
We will ride

(Ride, ride)
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride

I have loved you since the dawn my love
Through the storm my love we will ride
