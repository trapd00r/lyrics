Sometimes my love may be put on hold
Sometimes my heart may seem awful cold
These times come and these times go
As long as I live, all you need to know is

This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had
And all that's next
'Long as my heart's beating in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget

Often a heart tends to change its mind
A new day decides on a new design
A new day gets set on another way
As long as I live, all I've got to say is

This old dog ain't about to forget
All we've had
And all that's next
'Long as my heart's beating in my chest
This old dog ain't about to forget
