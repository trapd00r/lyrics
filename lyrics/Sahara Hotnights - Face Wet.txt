Time to let her know
About the short way to go
Time to let her know about the
Time to let her know
About the short way to go
Time to let her know about the, yeah

She comes down to the sound of .....
Jesus didn't think like her at all
She buries herself and cries her face wet
While everyone's looking
She committed a crime
And she admitted, I love my ego
But love was just too fond of ....
To give her what she needed

It is
Time to let her know about the short way to go
Time to let her know about the
Better had days coming up
Whenever she wants them to
Time to let her know

There's nothing to tell you my friend
She seems to be young so imature
Tries to grab control of life
With some hands that are way too small
And when it sometimes its useless to try
So we're stuck behind the sun
Oh yeah she is so sad
But no one really do care

It is
Time to let her know about the short way to go
Time to let her know about the
Better had days coming up
Whenever she want them to

She's just one of us
Who thinks that all shoes
Are the worst ones to walk in
She's just one of us
Who thinks that oh mine
Is the most troubled mind
She's just one of us
Who has faith in words like
Clever, nice, pretty
She's just one of us
Who gets tortured in self-pity

It is
Time to let her know about the short way to go
Time to let her know about the
Better had days coming up
Whenever she want them to

Time to let her know about the short way to go
Time to let her know about the
Better had days coming up
Whenever she want them to
Time to let her know
