Little girl does your mama
Know you're out tonight?
And if she did would she die of fright
Just to know you're out with me

Little girl do you think that I'm a fool?
And if you do, does it change your mind?
Or will you love me all the time

I'm so much older than you
You don't know what I'm going through
I only know that this feeling inside
I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide

Little one I guess that we had better go
I know, I know, I know, baby don't you cry
I'll see you soon my little one, yes I will
