You locked the door, don't know why
You had to keep it all inside
Just had to smell that sweet perfume
And watch the stars, the soul, the room

Some other summer
Some other summer
You will do better
Oh, the crash will make you stronger
Some other sunshine
Some other shoreline
You will do better
Oh, the burning

You catch your heart, you did it fast
No one wants the pain to last
And all the beauty gathered round
Your tainted dream went down the ground

Some other summer
Some other summer
You will do better
Oh, the crash will make you strong
Some other sunshine
Some other shoreline
You will do better
Oh, the burn makes you strong
Some other summer
Some other summer
You will do better
Better, better, better
Some other Friday
Some other Saturday
You will do better
Oh, the burning makes you strong

(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa)
(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa)
(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa)
(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
(Whoa, whoa, ah)
(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, ah)
(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa)

Some other summer
Some other summer
You will do better
Oh, the crash will make you strong
Some other sunshine
Some other shoreline
You will do better
Oh, the burning makes you strong
Some other summer
Some other summer
You will do better
Better, better, better
Some other Friday
Some other Saturday
You will do better
Some other summer

Some other summer
Some other summer
You will do better
Oh, wooh
Some other sunshine
Some other shoreline
You will do better
You will do better

Some other summer
Some other summer
You will do better
Some other summer
Some other Friday
Some other Saturday
You will do better
