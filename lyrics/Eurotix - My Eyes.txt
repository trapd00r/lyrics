Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you Hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
Touch me not, touch me not,
Oh, come back tomorrow;
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Shies from the sorrow

I am puzzled as a newborn baby
I am troubled as the tide
Should I stand amidst the breakers?
Or should I lie with Death my bride?
Swim to me
Swim to me
Oh, come let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
