Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows

(My story)
Went from dancin' on table tops
To makin' labels pop
For tha love of tha money
So I could cop everything
From icy rings to drop tops
Now I'm on top
But to look back on my reality
Happy I stopped lettin' niggas rule my world
Impressed by niggas tryin' to school this baby girl
I was fuckin' too early
15 knowin' money was green
Puffin' too early
Body big not grown
Knowledged up too early
Thought it was cute to flirt with older cats
Up in they face
Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in the space
My mommy was my shelter but I broke free
Learnin' that the streets was harder
Than I thought they'd be
Wantin' to be grown- rebellin'
Ain't no tellin' where I'd be- pussy sellin'
Never would i
Instead I wore a g-string
Thought never could i
Thougth I had to to be grown beginning of my life

Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Ooh
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)

Yo closed my self down held myself in
Exposed my myself alone no one helpin'
What am I to do but cryin' on that night
No one in the house knew TV was my life
Who was I to tell and what would they think of me
No one understood the pain that was sent to me
Broke down from the things men would say to me
Sellin; dreams to a naive kid- I blame me

But I never really had someone to tell me what to do
Teach me that I'm better than just pussy that's true
Teach me that the future was written already waitin'
So respect myself and life not to be consumed with hatin'
Do positive and positive would happen
Stay positive and positive was rappin'
It was like my brain was clouded with unnecessary shit
But I chose to see through the negative and make hits

Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Ooh
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)

Yo yo now I'm 20 years old and look where I'm at
I thank the lord every day and pray there's no turnin' back
I wannna keep my family happy and that's that
See tears in my mother's eyes from platinum placks
See things that I've done I don't regret
I just learn from mistakes in the past knowin' that
I had to earn respect and earn trust
In school was never given
The way you find out about life is simply livin'
To be strong stay strong let nobody crush you
Your body is your temple young girls
Don't let him touch you
He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you
Don't settle for second let him put no one above you
I did a lot of things in my life I take back
Gotta take from the good and the bad collect that
Cause it helps to build who you see now respect that
Young black and strong keep me in your tape deck

Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Ooh
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows (heaven only knows)
Ooh
