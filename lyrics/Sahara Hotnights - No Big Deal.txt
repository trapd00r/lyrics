Now I'm gonna let it show
You've got me down
But I won't stay low
I'll make my point
I'll rub it in
I'll watch you slip out of your skin

You're no big deal
Out of style and out of class
Know what I mean
Your name will never last

I can't wait 'til I get back
Into action and attack
Doesn't matter what you say
Hey, what's your mission anyway

You're so afraid of losing it
But you're more afraid of showing it
No good manners, no social skills
Just vanity and overkill
