She she came from the land of the cotton
Land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
And She worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun

Oh, but she sure could sing
Oh, she sure could sing

Then He looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided
He'd help her some
And he didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
For deep inside his heart he knew
She was the only one

Oh but she sure could sing
Yeah she sure could sing

She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prayed every night to the Lord up Above
Singing Hallelujah oh hallelujah

They use to walk singing songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure
She had to go away
And she never knew what her life had to give her
And never had to worry about it
For one single day

My but she sure could sing
Oh yes sure could sing

She had faith, she had believing
Led all the people together in singing
And she prayed every night to the lord up above
Hallelujah oh hallelujah

She she came from the land of the cotton
Land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
And She worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun

Oh, but she sure could sing
My, she sure could sing
Oh, but she sure could sing
Oh, but she sure could sing
