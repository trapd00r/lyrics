If I give you my love
Don't refuse it
Won't wear it out
If we use it

It's something special
So don't abuse it
Once you've got it
I promise you won't lose it

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough
Of my good love
Open up and let me in

Too much of a good thing
Let my love take control
When you're with me there'll never me
We're gonna do it, let's get to it

Don't tell me to slow down
Or take it easy
I want you right now
And completely

If I give you my heart
Maybe you'll see
You will never need
A love in place of me

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough
Of my good love
Open up and let me in

Too much of a good thing
Let my love take control
When you're with me there'll never me
We're gonna do it, let's get to it

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough
Of my good love
Open up and let me in

Too much of a good thing
Let my love take control
When you're with me there'll never me
We're gonna do it, let's get to it

We're gonna do it, let's get to it
We're gonna do it, let's get to it
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do

Too much of a good thing
You can never get enough
Of my good love
Open up and let me in

Too much of a good thing
Let my love take control
When you're with me there'll never me
We're gonna do it, let's get to it
