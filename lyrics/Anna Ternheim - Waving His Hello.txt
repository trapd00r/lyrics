When it all falls
Where will you be
How should I know
He said to me

The sky is my roof
The time is my sea
I rise with the waves
I fall with the leaves

When it all goes
Who will get to kjeep
The rhymes and the chords
Memorize his love songs

The lines and the poems
The letters he wrote
To a dear friend
Many years ago

Waving his hello
Waving his hello

When it all falls
Who will you hold
When the paper walls
Makes the silence grow

Always in the same coat
In sighs of smoke
Nodding his head
As we both hurry on

Waving his hello
Waving his hello

Waving his hello
Waving his hello

Come long lost dreams
Forgotten days
I think of you
When I see his face
When I see his face
