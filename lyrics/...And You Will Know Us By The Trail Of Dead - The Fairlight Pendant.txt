How much fun
To be drifting along
With the weight of the sun on my head
Not covered in sad
As I sketch with my pen
And I brace for the troubles ahead
Slow
Like the weight of the bow
Takes you on as you pull the string back
Don't be fooled by the light
...
As your head opens into their time
You will pay
You will pay for your new soul
Down
Through a hole in the ground
Let the ferryman carry you back
To the winter queen's home
In the shadow abroad
Where you learn to become one of them and
You
... shoes
In the house of the dead
Makes the ferryman sigh
... in his eye
And he lets you return back to the time
You will pay
You will pay now that you came
You will pay
You will pay for your new soul
