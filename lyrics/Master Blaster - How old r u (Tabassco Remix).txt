Get your hands up, people!

Master Blaster!

Now, how old are you, where is your harbor
Have many things to do, open the door
Yes, I live so true, without my lover
But tell me if the sky is blue, how old are you?

Now, how old are you, where is your harbor
Have many things to do, open the door
Yes, I live so true, without my lover
But tell me if the sky is blue, how old are you?

Pump-pump-pump pump it up!
Falling for the light no more!
Get your hands up, people!

How, how, how, how ...
Now, how old are you, where is your harbor
Have many things to do, open the door
Yes, I live so true, without my lover
But tell me if the sky is blue, how old are you?
