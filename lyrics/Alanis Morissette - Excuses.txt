Why no one will help me I'm too dumb I'm too smart
They'll not understand me I'm lonely they'll hate me

There is not enough time It's too hard to help me
God wants me to work no resting no lazy

These excuses how they've served me so well
They've kept me safe they've kept me stuck
They've kept me locked in my own cell

I'm too far from home it takes far too much energy
I cannot afford to, no one will ever see me

These excuses how they've served me so well
They've kept me safe they've kept me stuck
They've kept me locked in my own cell
These excuses how they're so familiar
They've kept me blocked they've kept me small 
They've kept me safe inside my shell

Bringing these into the light shakes their foundation and clears my sight
Now my imagination is the only thing that limits the bar and its' rise to the heights

No one can have it all see I have to, they want me to
I can't let them down I will never be happy

These excuses how they've served me so well
They've kept me safe they've kept me stuck
They've kept me locked in my own cell
These excuses how they're so familiar
They've kept me blocked they've kept me small 
They've kept me safe inside my shell
