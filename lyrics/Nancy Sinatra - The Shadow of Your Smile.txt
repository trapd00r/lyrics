The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
That lights the dawn

Look into my eyes oh my love and you will see
All the lovely things that you are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
And all the joys that love can bring
That's when I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

A wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips girl
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that your love can bring
I would be remembering
The shadow of your smile

Now when I remember spring
And all the lovely joys your love can bring
I would be remembering
The shadow of your smile
