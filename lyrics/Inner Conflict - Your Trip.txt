Infection on the spirit - One`s so clean and pure 
Now has been invaded - By something obscured 
Tongues are spoken widely - Message from the dead 
Enter transformation - to a State of no return 

Sicker - The only thing your body`s turning 
Vomit paints the floor - in blood 
Disease - That won`t come out through bible treatment 
The seed has begun - to grow 

"Infected soul" 
Bitings in your gut, spikes nailed in your soul, shakes are getting worse 
Rotting deep inside - demonic - standing petrified 
You start to suffer inner conflict 
Bleeding you scream in agony - your world is now at one with it 

Your body`s turning weak, a suicidial need, is tearing you within 
In the mirror you see - "a rotten corpse" 
Still you are alive - and breathing - robber of life 
You painful suffer inner conflict 
You try to keep your sanity - the force crave what`s left of it 

[Solo : Karlsson] 

Spewing - You start to choke on blood and innards 
This life soon will turn to - Death 
Cramping - Within your self theres heavy movement 
Something want`s to exit - you`r soul 

Labour - You feel it`s coming out there`s no escape or hiding - Panic now is total 
Gasping - Your innards coming with it, you are puking bowels - Launching birth through sickness 

Starring - Before you lays a figure of unknown description - Shaped through inner conflict 
Helpless - Watch it disappear into the world your leaving - Sleep forever soulless
