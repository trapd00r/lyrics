Far and far down Arkansas
There lived a squatter with a stubborn jaw
His nose was droopy red and his whiskers grey
He could fiddle all the night and all the day
Came a traveler down the road
Ask if he could find an in
Can I find an in
Come on can I find an in
Far far down Arkansas
Here comes a government man
Talkin' to my pa
He told 'em I gots to go to school
I got to learn to be a gosh durn fool
Far far down Arkansas
I was a squatter with a stubborn jaw
My nose is droopy red
And my whiskers grey
'Cause the magical mystery tour
Has taken me away
Taken me away
Far and far down Arkansas
I was my mother
And I was my pa
A gov'meant man and a-whiskey still too
And everywhere I'm a-lookin' at you
Far and far down Arkansas
Are you stubborn
Look at your drooping jaw
Look at your drooping jaw
Smile
