You could come around once a year
Like a Christmas ghost
Or hold me down like an anchor, baby
But you can't do both

I can't be your father figure
But I could be your friend
Watch me burn my candle crazy
At both ends

Nothing's gonna change here anytime soon
Catchin' fish in the mornin', get drunk before noon
Watchin' little brown bubbles floatin' in the spoon
Could be soakin' in a warm bath or back in the womb
Anytime, anytime soon

Used to want to be an astronaut
But I was just a kid
Spent my days in a batting cage
Where a robot pitched

Once you were my blushing bride
I was your nervous groom
But now we're just more comfortable
Sleepin' in separate rooms, oh

Nothing's gonna change here anytime soon
Make a bed for the roses, hope that they bloom
I don't know if it's safe, but I just assume
I won't play in the majors or walk on the moon
Not anytime, anytime soon

Spin me a tornado, honey
Cry me a monsoon
Let's just get through the holidays
And the terrible twos

Christmas has passed
It's just yellow snow
Sometimes you gotta hear somethin'
That you already know, whoa

Nothing's gonna change here anytime soon
When it's all unpredictable, I can still count on you
Lookin' for the mailbox with the red balloons
I'll be late to the party and I have an excuse
'Cause no one likes breakin' bad news
It's nothin' I'm wantin' to do
Not anytime, anytime soon
