[Chrous: T.I]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said "it's over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Its stupid how I go in knowing everybody knowing that i'm
Sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join
Others sworn, under oath or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing they were this hot
Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off (so)
Better that than pissed on, i'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on, ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's you can see me in the night time
I get rich off livin' life, he check the check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind (mind, mind)

[Chrous: T.I]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate, 
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape 
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left. 
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face 
Nights over goodbye, hoe 
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over 
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover 
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up, 
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her, 
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up. 
She must've took me for some high roller. 
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy u a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder. 
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya 
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars 
You get your eyes swole up i'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote

[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit roller, curatin closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Yeah life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Peso, euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me tote in anything
All you gon' see is BANG!
Its so nice where I kick it
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
Its all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro this road we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
Imma stick this whole pad 
Full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock i'm racing in doubling time it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like theres an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon tell me that A&W aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg

[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne i remain
All alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came
They were gone fo' they came
Now, I don't wanna hang
I slapped fire with the rap gods
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why

[Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold

[T.I]
I bet the knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote

[Eminem]
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go

[T.I. & Eminem]
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said "it's over with" thats all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote
