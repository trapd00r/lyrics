What do you think of me?
Are you quite proud of this make-believe
The come down, that hangs around everything
You can admire in that girl
She's so... damn... beautiful

What do you see in me?
Are you quite proud of this make-believe
The feelin' that hangs around everything
You once admired in that girl
You're so... damn... beautiful

I will see you rise again
And I will feel you fly again
You're so wonderful
I will be there by your side
You're so wonderful
I will be there by your side
You're so damn beautiful

You're so damn beautiful

What do you see in me?
Are you quite proud of this make-believe
The feelin' that hangs around everything
You once admired in that girl
You're so damn beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

I see before the race you've run
And jump ahead too far
Your laughing eye again

You're so damn beautiful

You're so damn beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
