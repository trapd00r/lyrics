Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to 1
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

We Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

We Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride we ride, it's 'til the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(when we ride we ride it's 'til the day we die)

We Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

We Ride, when we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die
We Ride, When we ride we ride
It's 'til the day we die

We ride
