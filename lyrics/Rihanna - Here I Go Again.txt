Na na na na na oh na na na na na na na na

It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside

It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby here I go again

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize this happenin'
Baby here I go again

Here I Go Again

Still remember how you make me weak
How so hard to find the words to speak
I just can't excape the memories
I tried but I just can't break free
But I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin' back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that
