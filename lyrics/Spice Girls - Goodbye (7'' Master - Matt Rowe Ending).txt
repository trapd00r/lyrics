Listen, little child, there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
You know there's a better way for you and me to be

Melanie B:
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me

Goodbye, my friend 
I know you're gone, you said you're gone, 
But I can still feel you here
It's not the end 
I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear

So glad we made it 
Time will never change it, no, no, no
All:
No, no, no, no

Just a little girl, big at the kind of love
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world (Melanie C: Into the world), 
What a revelation
She found there's a better way for you and me to be

Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby

The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way

Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby
