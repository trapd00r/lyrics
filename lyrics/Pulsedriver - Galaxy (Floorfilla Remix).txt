I'm floating through the universe
Searching for a better world
Searching for another place
Beyond time, beyond space
Travelling through the galaxy
With no bunderies, no gravity
All is quiet and peaceful
Still longing for eternety

Travelling to the galaxy
With no bunderies, no gravity
All is quiet and peaceful
Still longing for eternety

(Ah)

Travelling through the galaxy
With no bunderies, no gravity
All is quiet and peaceful
(Ah)

(Ah)

I'm floating through the universe
Searching for a better world
Searching for another place
Beyond time, beyond space
Traveling through the galaxy
With no bunderies, no gravity
All is quiet and peaceful
Still longing for eternety
(Ah)

(Ah)
