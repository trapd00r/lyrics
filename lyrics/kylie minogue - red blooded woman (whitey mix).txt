Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
(Yeah)

Count backwards 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Before you get too heated and turned on
(This guy)
You should've learned your lesson all in times before
You've been bruised, you've been broken

And there's my mind saying, "Think before you go"
Through that door that takes me to nowhere
(Yes boy)
I stopped you all romantic crazy in your head
Do you think I listen? No, I don't care

'Cause I can't focus, I can't stop
You got me spinning round, round, round, round
(Like a record)
I can't focus, it's too hot
(Inside)
You'll never get to Heaven
If you're scared of getting high

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
I wanna keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you
(Yeah)

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
I wanna keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you

My concious saying, "Get down off the streets"
It's too dangerous and deadly
(Yes boy)
Has got you talking round in circles got you see
All for the sake of sexy
(Loving it)

And as my friends say, "Stop before you fall"
I don't wanna pick you up again
(Yes boy)
He's got you all romantic and crazier each day
Do you think I listen? There's no way

'Cause I can't focus, I can't stop
You got me spinning round, round, round, round
(Like a record)
I can't focus, it's too hot
(Inside)
You'll never get to Heaven
If you're scared of getting high

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
I wanna keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
I wanna keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you

Let me keep freaking around
Red blooded women
It's too hot inside
And you'll never get to Heaven
If you're scared of getting high

La la la la la la la la
(Freaking around)
La la la la la la la la
(Freaking around)
La la la la la la la la
(Freaking around)
La la la la la la la la
(Freaking around)

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
I wanna keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you

(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
And I'm a red-blooded woman
What's the point of hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
I wanna keep turning it down
When this girl wants to rock with you

Wanna rock with you
