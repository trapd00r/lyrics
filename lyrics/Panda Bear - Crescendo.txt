Back of the drawer

Is this the day
Noble relative

Picked up the drop
My only way

Once in a way
I thought it better off

Once in a while
My only spy

Don't mean it's crazy
Don't get wet from rock

This is the day
Noble relative

Yeah

Witness the crowd
Into the stew
Ripple with friends
That ripple with you
Head for the gaps
Keep a tool in your hand
Given a chance
As the flat tire flaps

Go where the angels go

This Monday morning
