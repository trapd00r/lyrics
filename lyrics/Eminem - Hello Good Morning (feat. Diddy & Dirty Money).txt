[Rick Ross:]
Hello Good morning tell me what the lip read
pretty face, thin waist with the sick weave
first time fish tailing in the 6 speed
real bad boy tell em come and get me
I'm at the fight, been kinda like Bellmen
only took the trip to the truck twice
unpacked the Mac 11 and air max’s
stuff six figures in my damn air mattress
uh, I’m in love with large bills
a dime with a fat ass, thin waist and tall heels
yeah, it’s the teflon Don,
hundred carrots in the charm tryna give it back to Sean.

[Diddy:]
Hello, Good morning

Hello, Good morning
Hello, Good morning
Know you’ve been waiting for it

[Dirty Money:]
Cause I’ve been leaning on the bar
looking cleaner than the star

25 on the bank I be stunting on their ass
and they mad cause the bitch won’t stop

[Diddy - Dirty Money - Chorus:]
Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie

I ain’t coming out for less than a 100 thou
man, the last time I checked I was bubbling out
got to turn down shows, out in Dublin now
wait wait hold on, maybe they didn’t get that here
like 11 hundred horses when I switch that gear
swerve on them sorta like I missed that dear
press that little button on the sit back chair
bitch I do it cause I get it
I got billion dollar credit
if you got a million dollars you could put it up in bet it
I just be like hello hello but I never could salute them
young money I do it for the yout dem!

[Diddy]

and I’m the one that you wanna be with
but right now baby you dreaming
wake up and turn the lights off

[Dirty Money:]
Cause I’ve been leaning on the bar
looking cleaner than the star

25 on the bank I be stunting on their ass
and they mad cause the bitch won’t stop

[Chorus]
