Over a night
I got yours and no others
Now we will make a life
Of thouse hours
I got yours
On a misty height
 
So by the morning
I knew all about treasures
Where it was going
Nothing but measures
I got yours
In front of the fading sun
 
During the day we would talk about
Moving
You said I was late
But that you knew I was coming
I got yours
In the enlightened night
 
And later this evening
I was so full of you
Now I only have things
I must not ever lose
I'm yours
So let every morning come
 
Just after midnight
You said now I can't go
Back where you can't follow
I must stay with you
I'll be yours
Forever will be the shortest time
 
Over a night
I got yours and I love you
So light and so easy
I love you I love you
I'm yours
I am yours
