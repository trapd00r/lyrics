And when it hurts for me
I've never felt so empty
Then the rain has its way
Falling
Falling

Those summer mornings
You kissed me out of my next dream
Then without warning
It goes away

And then it goes
And then it goes
And then it goes

Searched to find you somewhere
As winds began to sway
Got in my car and just
Driving
Driving

Those summer mornings
I danced inside your warm embrace
You hear me calling
And now you're gone
