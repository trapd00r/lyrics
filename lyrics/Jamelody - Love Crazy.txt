I don’t know you as I should, no 
To be here talking, love love mmmmm 
This may not be what I need, but 
I think I’m way past reasoning 
Some say that love unreturned 
Ain’t nothing more than a obsession, but 
I believe you’re feelin’ me, cos 
This attraction is just too strong 
You got me in dem 

Crazy love, love 
I don’t know what to do 
But I know that it’s true, true 
Crazy love, love (Crazy) 
Crazy love 

Boy I know you’re holding back, oh 
Your sheepishness is a thin disguise 
You could tell a thousand lies, but 
Hell, I can see it in your eyes 
Why’re you so afraid of love, did 
Somebody hurt you and break your heart? Well 
Love’s a gamble, sometimes lost, but you never give in, cos 
This time may be your time to win, to miss, it could be 

Crazy love, love 
I don’t know what you’ll do 
But I know that it’s true, true 
Crazy love, love (Crazy) 
Keeps me up through the night 
You’re just there on my mind
