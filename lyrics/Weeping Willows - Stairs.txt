What will happen when I die
Will I pay for all My crimes
Because sometimes I did fail, although I tried to try
Will You remember me this way 
or will the picture change
It's too late to go back; oh it's much too late
when I was young I didn't care, I was busy crawling down the stairs

With the voice I thought was mine 
I didn't sing, I mime two words that almost rime
well those where confusing times  
Will You remember Me this way or will the picture change
It's too late to go back; oh it's much too late
When I was young I didn't care, I was busy crawling down the stairs

Please don't forget Me when I'm gone, 'cause my life must have some work
And please forgive me if im wrong 
'cause I didn't mean to be all wrong

I didn't mean to be
No, I didn't mean to be
I didn't mean to be all wrong
I didn't mean to be
I didn't mean to be
No I didn't mean to be
