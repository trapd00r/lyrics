Yes,
1996, Disfunctional member of the Alkohaliks family
It's XZIBIT, Bring it live, one time, like this

Sometimes I wonder if it's all worth my while
Xzibit stay versitile
With Million Dollar lifestyle
And I could feel it as a child growin' up
The niggaz that was real and the niggaz that was scared as fuck
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
So ease off the trigga talk, you ain't killin' shit
It's not affecting me or the niggaz that I'm chillin' with
I don't believe the hype or buy a Woof tickets
Nigga you make a gang of noise and never sing like a cricket
I guess that's why we never kick it
A lot of niggaz are soft and get tossed tryin' to fuck with the liquid
How many niggaz do you know like this?
Always claimin that they're riding but they really turn bitch
It don't make sense
Either you're a soldier from the start
Or an actor with a record deal tryin' to play the part
Like that

It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Extra large
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Paparazzi (2x)

I don't need no lights no cameras
Just action god dammit
Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
Emergin from the fog with my fucked up dialogue
Try to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And niggaz you spent it on, would not give a fuck
Now that's deep, how deep, It's deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous
Big Bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, Vandelous
Yo, not to be trusted
So how the fuck is you hard
Not being scared by the boulevard
I'm pulling that card and sayin' Gin motherfucker
Flowin like liquid, soak it in motherfucker
I'm breakin it down, my sound surrounds like death
From the West
Puttin' whole counties to the test
It's all in perspective
Break a one-nine copy
This is for the niggaz gettin' caught up in the Paparazzi

It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Extra large
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Paparazzi (2x)

Niggaz smoke stress and cross dress
But I just played it back
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams
For a contract
Real tightly rolled, fuck 'em all how I feel
I made a cool half mil
Before I had a record deal
Therefore you look and stare like it's magic
But too much of anything can make you a addict
When devils be startin static, bring out the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate, but wait
Who dare to cross this path
Yo, I'll do ya like math
Cut with glass, make a blood bath
So on behalf of all niggaz I get drunk with
Smoke them blunts with
I dispose of your punk shit
Keep it all in perspective
Carbon Copies gettin' caught up in the Paparazzi
Once again, It's the liquidation crew, and we return for you
Like this

It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Extra large
It's a shame
Niggaz in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Paparazzi (2x)
