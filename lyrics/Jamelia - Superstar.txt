People always talk about
ey-o ey-o ey-o
All the things there on about
Ey-o ey-o ey-o
Write it on a piece of paper (Paper)
Got a feeling I'll see you later (Later)
Theres something 'bout this
Lets keep it moving
And if its good lets just get something cooking
Cause I really wanna rock with you
Im feeling some connection to the things you do
You do, you do...

(Chorus)
I dont know what it is
That makes me feel like this
I dont know who you are
But you must be some kind of superstar
Cause you got all eyes on you no matter where you are
You just make me wanna play

Baby take a look around
ey-o ey-o ey-o
Everybodys getting down
Ey-o ey-o ey-o
Deal with all the problems later (Later)
Bad boys on their best behavior theres something 'bout you
Lets keep it moving
And if its good lets just get something cooking
Cause I really wanna rock with you (With you)
Im feeling some connection to the things you do
You do, you do

(Chorus)
I dont know what it is
That makes me feel like this
I dont know who you are
But you must be some kind of superstar
Cause you got all eyes on you no matter where you are (Where you are)
You just make me wanna play

I like the way your moving
Ey-o ey-o ey-o
I'm just gettin to the groove and then
You just make me wanna play
If you just put pen to paper
Ey-o ey-o ey-o
Got that feeling I'll see you later (Later)
Ey-o ey-o ey-o

Make your, move
Cant we get a little closer?
You, rock it just like your supposed to
Hey! Boy I aint got nothing more to, say
Cause you just make me wanna play!

I dont know what it is
That makes me feel like this
No, no, gotta be gotta be a superstar!
All eyes on you
Ohh Now!
'Coz You just make me wanna play!

(Chorus)
I dont know what it is (I dont know)
That makes me feel like this (I dont know)
I dont know who you are (I dont know)
But you must be some (Gotta be a superstar)
Cause you got all eyes on you no matter (No matter) where you are
You just make me wanna play

I dont know what it is
That makes me feel like this (I dont know what it is)
I dont know who you are (That makes me feel like this)
(Idont know who you are) But you must be some kind of superstar
Cause you got all (All) eyes on you no matter where you are
(No matter where you are)
You just make me wanna play
