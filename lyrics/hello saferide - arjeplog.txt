The obstacles we build for ourselves, my love! 
Creating decisions to make, my love! 
When really, it could be this easy: 
you and me, and house, and food. 

Your roots are stuck in the dirt of this land, 
my questions all answered in the firmness of your hand,
I buried some hatred in the snow on the porch,
and when it comes undone, I will understand. 

And the wind in the trees are like: sch-uuung, sch-uuung.
And the trains that pass by are like: sch-du-dung, sch-du-dung.
And you and me are like: come on, let's go out for a walk. 

And our feet in the snow are like: tsch-ooo, tsch-ooo. 
And the choir in my chest is like: oooo- oooo.
And the Stockholm insecurity is like: I don't exist. 

Night dawns on us now, my love! 
We finally found a way to lie, my love!
Without an arm getting numb in the middle of us, my love. 

Don't you get scared of those people now 
who look you in the eye and smile at you now.
Yes, they condemn you, but they won't tell!
And that's just how it goes, my love. 

And the wind in the trees are like: sch-ooo, sch-ooo.
And the trains that pass by are like: sch-du-dung, sch-du-dung.
And you and me are like: take your coat on, let's go out for a walk. 

And the tears in our eyes when we ski fast in the forest,
but the choir in my chest is always stuck on the chorus. 
And I know it's in me to get away from all of this. 

Though I like this the best, I always liked this 
the best. 

The obstacles we build for ourselves, my love. 
The time we spend making decisions, my love. 
There's a longing in me for things that yet haven't occurred.
So I'll return to you, city, again and again.
