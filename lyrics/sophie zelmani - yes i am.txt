I am tired, yes I am
I'm a coward, yes I am
Now I understand
how long I've been a canting woman
You say, that something's wrong
Today, and many more will come
Though I really longed
I want you to leave me alone

I had to ask my friends
our excuses never ends
I'm just a lazy, bored adult
to selldom there are good results

I think about this all the time
I can admit how bad it rimes
I want you, yes I do
