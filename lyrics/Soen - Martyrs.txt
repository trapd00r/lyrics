Leave your hope for truth, in the hands of faith
Let it lead the way
None of us is whole, madness shapes our fate
We're the ones to blame

The thinking mind is singled out
The fool is royalty and
Never will let you evolve

Our laments echo silent, hidden to their eyes
The wordless ghost of mankind
Tongueless criticize

The masses voice is silent
Lost within our walls
They're waiting for a mistake
To provide our fall

Spirit of the water, let the sky fall down on me
Suffocate the fires lit to harm
Hear the prayers calling and embrace our fallen sons
Heal the open wound that bleeds the earth

Shepherd of the elite, guiding light of vain
Idol of its prey
Give your servants hope while they beg for change
And so they'll obey...

We are made for dreaming, for wandering the earth
For what we have is all we need
Framed inside a system
Made to praise the tame
A leash to keep our will restrained

Drowning in the shadow, of the wonders we have built
We are
The ashes and the seeds
Spirit of the water, let the rain pour down on me
We know
Our essence is the key

Spirit of the water, let the sky fall down on me
Suffocate the fires lit to harm
Hear the prayers calling and embrace our fallen sons
Heal the open wound that bleeds the earth
