When I get out of bed
(You know I miss You)
When I ride in my car
(You know I miss you)
In a traffic jam
(You know I miss you)
All the way 'round town
(Yeah 'cause know I miss you)
Sit starin' at work
(You know I miss you)
Yeah all day it hurts, because they left me
And I go out get drunk
(You know I miss you)
Come home pass out
(Yeah because know I miss you)

Chorus:
I say a prayer for you to come back
(to come back)
For you to come back (yeah!)

Like a motherless child
(You know I miss you)
Like a junkie strung out
(You know I miss you)
I hit the wall all night
(Because I miss you)
Til the lights go out
(Yeah becasue I miss you)
Like a preacher without the congregation
Like a rebel wondering where the wave went
Unlike you, I've never been patient
Times standing still
(Because I miss you)

You know I miss you x2
Because I miss you
Yeah because I miss you

Chorus

Yeah because I miss you
