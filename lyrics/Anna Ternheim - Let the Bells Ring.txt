Not a word from you, I'm waiting
Do you get my letters, I get non
I've been everywhere to find you
Cause I refuse to belive you'r gone

I've been through every stage of waiting
Fury and anger, indifference and hate
Deep down I know that I still love you
I always have and I always will

So I keep on searching until I find you
Writing these letters every day

Cause I refuse to belive you left me
Cause you'll never leave
Nor stop loving me
Cause I would hurt you beyond belief
