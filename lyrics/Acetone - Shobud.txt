All the hours
All the days
Keep everyone you know
In a case

In your window
Now you see
All of the things that will come
In between

Morning
In the morning

All you wanted
And you need
And everything you know you'll
Never be

Where the time goes
Now you see
All of the things that will come
In between
All of the things that will come
In between

Morning
In the morning
