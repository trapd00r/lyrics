I've got war on my mind blood on my hands
And love on my head
So open your hands open your mouth
Let it be said
You know I've got it mad in my mind
Don't waste my time it's not going to change
So say what you want spit it out loud
Into my face

And I'll pay no attention
No attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention

They're gonna tell you where to walk
When to smile and just what to say
They say have your own fun
Make your own mind
And don't make no waves
But if you got a handful of change
Don't throw it away it's gonna come
So say what you want, suck all my
Suck on my brain

And I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention

No attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
No attention
I'll pay no attention
No attention
I'll pay no attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention
No attention

They're gonna tell you where to walk
When to smile and just what to say
They say have your own fun
Make your own mind
And don't make no waves
But if you got a handful of change
Don't throw it away it's gonna come
So say what you want, suck all my
Suck on my brain

And I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
