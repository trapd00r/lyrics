There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and I
A world of shadows and rain
He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery â€” Yeah!
He's got your Chains of Misery

There's a prophet in the gutter in the street
He says "You're damned!"
And you believe him
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear
He smelt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery

It's only love that holds the key to your heart
It's only love

He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery
He lies to you he won't let you be
He's got your Chains of Misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your Chains of Misery
He's got your Chains of Misery
