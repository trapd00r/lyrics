Hold...
This morning to you
All night I flew
Here I go...
Open the floor

Open the mirrored sky
Catch these feelings falling by
Clean your mouth out
With words that don't hurt

-The fall won't be too long-

Clear you'll find me
Standing by
Clearing here a place to die
Hold it
Oh, I'm holding
I'm holding on...

I hold it
I hope
I hold
Aha!
