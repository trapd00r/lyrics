[Intro: News talk]

[Verse 1:]
So this is it
This is what I wished for
This isn't how I invisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought that this shit would be different
There's something changed the minute
I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it,
Smell it,
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit!
I just wanted a lil' bit
Then it turned me into a monster
I became a hypocrite,
Concert after concert
I was raking in the doe,
Rolling in green
Had the game hammed up like a sewing-machine
But I was losing my freedom,
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
It just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it,
Every cd critics gave it a 3,
And then 3 years later they're go back and re-rate it
And called the Slim Shady LP the greatest,
The Marshall Mathers was a classic,
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the calibre to match it,
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic
And 8 years later I'm still at it,
Divorced,
Re-married,
A felon,
A father,
Sleeping pill addict.
And this is real talk,
I feel like the incredible hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk.

[Chorus:]
So be careful what you wish for,
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do,
Waiting cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I said be careful what you wish for,
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do,
Waiting cause it might just come back on you tenform

[Verse 2:]
I got a letter from a fan that said: he's been praying for me,
Everyday and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy,
Cause I don't read every,
Letter I get!
But something told me to go ahead and open it,
BUT,
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local,
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at,
I've already told you
ATLEAST
A thousand times in these rhymes,
I appreciate the prayer
But I've already got god on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite stand-point
Man, boys gotta look NUTS,
And that's the only word I can think of right now,
Won't know how to describe the shit,
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it,
Just watch what you wish for cause I got this shit!

[Chorus:]
So be careful what you wish for,
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do,
Waiting cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I said be careful what you wish for,
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do,
Waiting cause it might just come back on you tenfold
