It’s such a small place you came from
It’s so far the other way that you’ve gone
Across the bridge past the still waters
Towards the white clapboard  towers
To say a prayer in a place where
You were hoping someone might hear

Might as well be
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
Might as well be
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
Away

Sometimes you go too far
The things you do will they break your heart
Have you forgotten what is real
Is this the only way you can feel
Across the bridge past the still waters
Towards the white clapboard  towers

Might as well be
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
Might as well be
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
Away

Your not sure
If you’ll ever be
This high again

Your not sure
If you’ll ever be
Be this high again

Your not sure
If you’ll ever be
Be this high again
 
Might as well be a million miles
A million miles
Might as well be a million miles
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
A million miles
Away
