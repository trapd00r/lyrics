Pleading graces for the youth
For making us make up the truth
Loading faces sounding forced
We felt the hole without a source

Grip the apple, stomp the snake
Clip our nails, give them a break
Give my life back within reason
Can my mind get over what we've become?

Do you know how to take this?
Is this our real life?
How easy is it to have fun?
Is this a movie?

Where I'm not bleeding
In a dream, I held the power of the sun
Give my life back if you believe us
Within reason
