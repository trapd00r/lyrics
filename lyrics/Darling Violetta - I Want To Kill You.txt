I... want... to... kill... you
When you least expect it
I'll bash your brains in
When you least expect it

You're afraid of flying
Afraid of losing your mind
But I don't want to know you
Now there's no time

It's both a lovely and a fearful thing
To be captured by all of your feelings
I breathe into you
Into you

You run to me and
Don't even know my name
Desire's slowly becoming
Your great escape

You let me wonder
Now I'll let you burn
I promise nothing
But still you return to me
I breathe into you
I breathe into you
You are real

I am walking through the morning
Dandelion stares in my eyes
I wish you were caught by now
I'm afraid of what they'll find
Take the box of magic
Lay it in the back of your mind
Can we wash in the morphine
After we eat we'll be fine
You're the lonely lovers
I've only known a few
Take me within and you'll know what love is... easy
Let me watch you dance
Let me watch you sleep
Kiss her with your tongue
And you'll crawl to me again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
I breathe into you
I breathe into you
You are real
I breathe into you
I breathe into you
You are real
