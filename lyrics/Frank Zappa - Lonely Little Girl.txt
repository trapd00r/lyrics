You're a lonely little girl
But your mommy and your daddy don't care
You're a lonely little girl

The things they say just hurt your heart
It's too late now for them to start
To understand the way you feel
The world for them is too unreal

So you're lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely little girl

All your children are poor unfortunate victims
Of systems beyond their control
(Where did Annie go when she went to town?
Who are all those creeps that she brings around?)
A plague upon your ignorance and the gray despair of your ugly life
All your children are poor unfortunate victims of lies
