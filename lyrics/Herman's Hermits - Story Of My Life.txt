Someday I'm going to write
The story of my life
I'll tell about the night we met
And how my heart can't forget
The way you smiled at me

I want the world to know
The story of my life
The moment when your lips met mine
And that first exciting time
I held you close to me

The sorrow in our love was breakin' up
The mem'ry of a broken heart
But later on, the joy of makin' up
Never never more to part

There's one thing left to do
Before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife
So the story of my life
Can start and end with you

The sorrow in our love was breakin' up
The mem'ry of a broken heart
But later on, the joy of makin' up
Never never more to part

There's one thing left to do
Before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife
So the story of my life
Can start and end
Can start and end
Can start and end with you
