Put me in the car JoJo

It's Pac
Heh heh, yeah, maybe it's the thug in me
Yeah, that type of shit
You know what time it is
Maybe it's the thug in me
By Age thirteen I was buck wild
Good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood
Never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man
I had shatter fools
That's till I put my eyes on you
God damn sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home
Get you all alone
In my bedroom baby can we bone?
And get it on?
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby
Come and bite me
But do it lightly
Cause that excites me to ?let it pop?
And if you lick me right
I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga
Though I like the way you scream when your loving me
I'm going deep it's the thug in me
So what you saying girl...

Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me (In me)
That I wanna put in you (Put in you)

Thug nigga like me
Need a thug lady like you
I got alotta thug in me
That I wanna give to you, girl

Moan baby when we bone, its on
It's so strong niggas in the next room will come
I got your head swinging
Tongue kissing
As I hit it from the back
With the bed ringing
Give me space
As I lick your face
Stick the place
Synchronized so I grind when they kick the bass
Love fucking in the morning
I get you wet and bust a sweat
Then I'm gone
Left you on your own
Girl tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded I'm cold do it real nice
That's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull your hair
While we fucking in the chair
When you loving me up against the wall
You can have it all
Just try
Bet my kiss, can get you high
Don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts
When I'm loving you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you


Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned I'm like a storm with my own thunder
I make the room rumble
In and out
Long stroke
Hold your breath, now close your eyes deep throat
Did you like it?
Ew, I'm excited
'Cause it's a party in my bedroom your invited
C'mon now let me see you shake your rump
Tell me, how long will it take to come?
Having fun, do it one on one or we can all get involved
First y'all do me then I fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay
Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, mother fuck a cash game
I got you going wild, 'cause I'm loving you
Drugged out with this mother fucking thug in you


(Laughing)
I don't wanna talk
I don't want no explanation
I don't got no mother fucking explanation, you know what I'm saying
It's just the thug in me
You don't be asking me why I'm I be pulling your hair
Or why I fuck so mother fucking thuggy
It's that thug passion, know what I mean?
No mercy
What you scared of ? (I ain't scared)
Didn't you come over here to get fucked? (yeah)
You ain't come over here to get stroking and all that bullshit
You came over here to get fucked
I fuck you thug style baby
You leave my house sayin' Tupac game served you
Don't have me crossed up in that bullshit (okay)
Turn over (okay baby)
Baby it's the thug in me (yeah)
