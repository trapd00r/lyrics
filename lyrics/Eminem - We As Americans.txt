*Glass smashing*
*Dog's barking*

There's an intruder, in my house
He cut my phone-line, can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me, when I shout

A couple o' cocktails, will send me to jail
There's a couple of cops, hot on my trail
But this time when I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher, and a Pit Bull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit, foolin' with me
Quit foolin' with me, bitch you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be
An issue when you're me, and which you're gonna see
In the long run, Im'a be the wrong one
You wanna harass, with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass
Where was you at, last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bare arms
What I'm 'posed to fight wit' bare palms
Yeah right, they comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns, we as Americans

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

I make bookoo bucks, wear bookoo vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I could've been next, to fly over the cuckoo's nest
But you know who, with an "S" tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed' it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it 50/50 on 50, it's funny
We got a buzz spreadin' quicker than making paper airplanes out of a 20
Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said, but I said precedents
In the standards, and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
The shit should've been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, one bastard
I'm too old to go an' cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit, I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time they got the fuckin Au-to-ma-tic
Ain't no one Gon' test this Mon', clack click

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

(SSHHH)

I got a secret, if you can keep it between us
I tuck 2 Nina's under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my Long Johns, under my Sean Johns
When runnin' with the long arm or the long long gone
Im'a do five years no less than that, o questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gone even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' gimme my semi but I got my weed back

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We as Samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans
