Every night I sit here by my window (window)
Staring at the lonely avenue (avenue)
Watching lovers holdin' hands
And laughin' (ha ha ha)
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

Memories are all I have to cling to (cling to)
And heartaches are the friends
I'm talkin' to (but you got me now)
When I'm not thinkin' of just how much
I love you ('bout I love you, too)
I'm thinkin' the things we used to do
(Used to do, thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' about the things we used to do

I still can hear the juke box softly
Playin' (playin')
And the face I see each day belongs to you
(Belongs to you)
But there's not a single sound 
And there's nobody else around
But that's just me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(We used to do, thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park (things)
Like a kiss in the dark (things)
Like a sailboat ride (ya ya)
What about the night that we cried
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' about the things we used to do
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to
You got me thinkin' 'bout 
The things we used to do (I hope so)
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
