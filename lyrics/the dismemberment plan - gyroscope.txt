She's wearing too much lipstick tonight 
A little black dress a little too tight 
Tries to make small talk but it drips with spice 
She knows that he's coming, it's really all right 

Nobody here could know how she feels 
Not getting drunk and she hates wearing heels 
Tries to stand but the room seems to bend and reel 
Her friends all keep asking why can't she just deal 

If she spins fast enough then maybe the broken pieces of her heart will stay together 
But ain't no gyroscope can spin forever, yeah
If she spins fast enough then maybe the broken pieces of her heart will stay together 
But ain't no gyroscope can spin forever, yeah

He says it's over, it's such a release
It's finally happened and he's making his peace 
The reminders don't bother him in the least 
The Jekyll and Hyde shit will finally cease 

His eyes on fire and his hands kind of shake 
Like his voice is ready to break 
You kind of wonder how long this boy's been awake 
Or just how much less sense one person can make

If he spins fast enough then maybe the broken pieces of his heart will stay together 
But ain't no gyroscope can spin forever, yeah
If he spins fast enough then maybe the broken pieces of his heart will stay together 
But ain't no gyroscope can spin forever, yeah

Happiness is such hard work and harder every day 
And it can kill you, but no one wants to be that tacky about it
If you spin fast enough then maybe the broken pieces of your heart will stay together 
But something I see lately makes me doubt it
