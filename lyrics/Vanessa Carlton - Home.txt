Some people live in a house on a hill 
And wish they were some place else 
There's nobody there when the evening is still 
Secrets with no one to tell 

And some I have known 
Have a ship where they sleep 
With sounds of rocks on the coast 
They sail over oceans five fathoms deep 
But can't find what they want the most 

And even now 
When I'm alone 
I've always known 
With you 
I am home 

And some live in towns 
Cardboard shack on concrete 
All blustered, and bustling life 
They search for the color 
They never quite see 
â€˜Cause it's all white on white 

And even now 
When I'm alone 
I've always known 
With you 
I am home 

And even now 
When I'm alone 
I've always known 
With you 
I am home 

For me it's a glance
And a smile on your face 
A touch of your hands 
And an honest embrace 

For where I lay, it's you I keep 
This changing world 
And fall asleep 
With you all I know is 
I'm coming home 
Coming home
