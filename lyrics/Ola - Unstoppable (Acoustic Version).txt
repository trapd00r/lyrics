I’m looking for your voice
Kimi no koe ga kikoeta kigashite
Hitori tachidomaru hitogomi no naka

I’m looking for your touch
Yakusoku wa mou kitasareru koto wa nai to
Namida wa kitto kidzuiteru

I’m looking for your heart
Oto mo tatezu kokoro wa hanarete yuku no
Setsunasa dake ga furitsumoru

I’m looking for your love
Hito wa daremo ienai kizu wo kakaete
Naze aruki tsudzukeru no darou

I believe afuredasu namida wa
Never be alone
Kienai negai wo utsusu deshou

I believe tadoritsuku itsuka wa
Never cry again
And i’m holding on shinjite’ru
Believe in love

I’m looking for my fate
Futari no mirai nante todoketa datta no*
Ima wa mou wakaranai kedo

I’m looking for my faith
Uso wa itte mo tori muite no ano sora wa
Atarashii asa hakobu no ne

I’m looking for my dream
Meguri atta kioku wa kitto yuku ne no*
Terashite kotae wo kureru no

I’m looking for my love
Kanashimi sae sayonara sae kono mune ni
Hajimari wo tsuretekuru kara

I believe tomaranai namida wo
Gonna smile again
Hikari wo atsumete kagayaku no

I believe meguri au kanaradzu
Gonna find my way
‘Cause i’m moving on shinjite’ru
Believe in love

I’m looking for my step
Mune no oku ni ienai kizu wo kakaete
Sore demo aruki tsudukeru no

I’m looking for my smile
Donna toki mo furiyamanai ame wa nai
Sashikomu hikari shinjiteru



TRANSLATION :

I’m looking for your voice
I’ve got this feeling that I heard your voice
I stopped, alone, in the midst of a crowd

I’m looking for your touch
There is nothing that a promise can bring now
You’ve noticed my tears for sure

I’m looking for your heart
The loneliness only thickens
When I let go of my silent heart

I’m looking for your love
Why can a person with unspeakable hurts
Bear to go on?

I believe The overflowing tears
Never be alone
Reflect our indelible wishes

I believe I’ll reach it someday
Never cry again
And I’m holding on I believe
Believe in love

I’m looking for my fate
Our future was supposed to be decided (?)
But now, I can’t tell

I’m looking for my faith
Speaking lies a bird faces that sky
That will be bringing a new tomorrow

I’m looking for my dream
I remember our fateful memories
I’ll give you the shining answers to them

I’m looking for my love
I was willing to take even sadness, even goodbyes
From the very beginning

I believe The unstoppable tears
Gonna smile again
Gather the brilliant light

I believe We will meet for certain
Gonna find my way
‘Cause I’m moving on I believe
Believe in love

I’m looking for my step
There are unspeakable hurts in my heart
But still, I walk on

I’m looking for my smile
A ceaseless rain will never come (?)
I believe in the ray of light
