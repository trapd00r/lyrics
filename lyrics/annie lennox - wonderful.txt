I want to have you, 'cause you're all I've got
I don't want to lose you, 'cause it means a lot
All the joy this world can bring
Doesn't give me anything
When you're not here

Idiot me, stupid fool
How could you be so uncool?
To fall in love with someone who
Doesn't really care for you
It's so obscure

But I feel...
Wonderful
Yes, I feel...
Don't you know I feel...
Wonderful

Come on!
God, it makes me feel so blue
Every time I think about you
All of the heat of my desire
Smokin' like some crazy fire
C'mon here, look at me where I stand
Can't you see my heart burnin' in my hand?
Do you want me? Do you not?
Does it feel cold, baby does it feel hot?

I want to hold you and be so held back
Don't want to need you, but it's where I'm at
Thinkin' about you everyday
How come I was made that way?
It's so surreal

But I feel...
(You know it makes me feel so, you know it makes me feel so)
Wonderful
Yes I feel...
(You know it makes me feel so)
Don't you know I feel...
(You know it makes me feel so)
Wonderful

God, it makes me feel so blue
Every time I think about you
All of the heat of my desire
Smokin' like some crazy fire
C'mon here, look at me where I stand
Can't you see my heart burnin' in my hand?
Do you want me? Do you not?
Does it feel cold, baby does it feel hot?

It makes me feel so blue
Every time I think about you
All of the heat of my desire
Smokin' like some crazy fire
C'mon here, look at me where I stand
Can't you see my heart burnin' in my hand?
Do you want me? Do you not?
Does it feel cold, baby does it feel hot?
