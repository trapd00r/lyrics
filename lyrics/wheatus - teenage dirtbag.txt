Her name is Noel
I had a dream about her
she rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh how she rocks
In keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

Cause Im just a teenage dirtbag baby
Yeah Im just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

Her boyfriends a dick
And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
And he drives an Iroc
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me

Cause Im just a teenage dirtbag baby
Yeah Im just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin
Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin

Man I feel like mold
It's prom night and I am lonely
Low and behold
She's walking over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am
And why does she give a damn about me

She said I've got tickets to Iron Maiden baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
Im just a teenage dirtbag baby like you

Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin
Yeeah dirtbag, no she doesn't know what she's missin
