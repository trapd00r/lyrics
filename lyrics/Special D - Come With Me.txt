Come with, come with me,
Come with, come with me,
Come with, come with me...

At the end of every week each one of us becomes a freak
Tonight the DJ makes us move under the sweat drops from the roof
It's time to let the bass beat hard, to know we all spend now apart
Just activate your energy, let's sing the song and come with me

The speaker system brings the sound, and light effects are spinnin' 'round 
All the people on the floor, they shake their bodies, cry for more
Never let this feeling go and let the music take control
Forget your problems and be free, enjoy this moment, come with me!

Turn it up, up, up, up, up, up!

Come with, come with me,
Come with, come with me,
Come with, come with me
Come, come, baby, come with me
