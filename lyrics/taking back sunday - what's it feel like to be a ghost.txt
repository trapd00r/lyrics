Then you said a little more about your dreams like that was my call (My call)
"If you would only listen"
Bypassed everything and went straight for the neck
(I study)
We're studied
(Up nightly)
Dragged you out into the streets before you buckled at your knees (You buckled at your knees)

"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"What's it feel like to be a ghost?" Ah
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)

This is quick but not quite painless,
It sits perched on your arm.
Tacky and irrelevant (So what?)
A permanent reminder that, oh Christ
(I study)
We're studied
(Up nightly)
Dragged you out into the streets before you buckled at your knees (Buckled)


"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"What's it feel like to be a ghost?" Ah
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)

I said "So look closely, there might be something you like"
"What was it like?"
(Oh and I...)
I look so close but it's been months, who knows if I will get this right...
(Oh and I...)
Look so closely, there might be something you'd like
What was it like?

Oh and I...

"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"What's it feel like to be a ghost?" Ah
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Are you up for, are you up for...)
