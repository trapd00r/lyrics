If it weren't for your maturity
None of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years
I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention 
You wouldn't have been successful, and
If it weren't for me
You would never have amounted to very much 

Ooh this could be messy, but
You don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody, and
Overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast-forward to a few years later
No one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee
And I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of protégé
And one day you'll say you learned all you know from me, and
I know you depend on me
Like a young thing would to a guardian
I know how you sexualize me
Like a young thing would and I think I like it

Ooh this could get messy, but
Ooh, you don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast-forward to a few years later
No one knows except the both of us
I've more than honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

Just make sure you don't tell on me
Especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves
And not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world
'Cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done-up properly
I might want to marry you one day
If you'd watch that weight and keep your firm body

Ooh this could be messy
Ooh I don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast-forward to a few years later
No one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this
