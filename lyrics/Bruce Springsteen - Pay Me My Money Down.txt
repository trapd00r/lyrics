I thought I heard the captain say
Pay me my money down
Tomorrow is our sailing day
Pay me my money down

Pay me, pay me
Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail
Pay me my money down

As soon as the boat was clear of the bar
Pay me my money down
He knocked me down with a spar
Pay me my money down

Pay me, pay me
Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail
Pay me my money down

Well, If I'd been a rich man's son
Pay me my money down
I'd sit on the river and watch it run
Pay me my money down

Pay me, pay me
Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail
Pay me my money down

I wish I was Mr. Gates
Pay me my money down
They'd haul my money in a crate
Pay me my money down

Pay me, pay me
Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail
Pay me my money down

Well, forty nights, and nights at sea
Pay me my money down
That captain worked every last dollar outta me.
Pay me my money down

Pay me, pay me
Pay me my money down
Pay me or go to jail
Pay me my money down
