Pounding, it starts again
Hurting, oh, where do I begin?
Screaming, they dance around my head, hoping they'll make me end up dead

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?

Feeling fucked-up again
(I've gotta do this right)
I can't fucking give in
(I've given my goodbyes)
Can't I ever win?
(I'll scream with all my might)
Here it comes, again

Silence, it goes away
Patience, oh, really should I stay?
Trying so hard to get ahead, failure is often where I'm led

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?

Feeling fucked-up again
(I've gotta do this right)
I can't fucking give in
(I've given my goodbyes)
Can't I ever win?
(I'll scream with all my might)
Here it comes, again

Oh, I must hold on
Oh, I won't be gone
Oh, I won't stop now
Oh, I don't know how

Why I can't hold on? 
(Here we go again, again, here we go again, again)
Why I can't be gone? 
(Here we go again, again, here we go again, again)
Why I can't stop now? 
(Here we go again, again, here we go again, again)
Why I don't know how? 
(Here we go again, again, here we go again, again)

Here we go again, again
Here we go again, again
Here we go again, again
Here we go again, again
Here we go again, again
Here we go again, again
Here we go again, again
Here we go again

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?

Feeling fucked-up again
(I've gotta do this right)
I can't fucking give in
(I've given my goodbyes)
Can't I ever win?
(I'll scream with all my might)
Here it comes, again
