Hey mister DJ
Put a record on

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But please don't tell me to stop

Please don't (ah)
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
Don't you ever
(Give it up, do as I say)
(Give it up, do as I say)

Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
(mm, mm)
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
(mm, mm)
Erotic, erotic

Mm, mm
Something's coming over
Mm, mm
Something's coming over
Mm, mm
Something's coming over me
My baby's got a secret

Mm, mm
Mm, mm…
Mm, mm (you're frozen)
Give yourself to me
Mm, mm (you're frozen)
You hold the key

Do you know
What it feels like for a girl
Do you know
What it feels like in this world
For a girl
You'd love to know what it's like, wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted why, oh why
The show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye…

(You recognize my voice?
It's Madonna
You can hear me?…)
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper
The further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter
The more that I know

The deeper, the deeper, the deeper I go
You've got to just
Let your body move to the music
Music, music, music, music

Music makes the people
Come together, yeah
Music makes the borgoisie and the rebel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Then I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel…

(Laughs)
