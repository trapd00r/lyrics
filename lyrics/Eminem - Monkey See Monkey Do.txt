Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ay yo 50
Whut I tell you
We ain't even have to say shit
They did it
Ha ha

Monkey see monkey do
They'll never make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon always say and do
What the other one do
So let 'em come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see monkey do
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come
Now here they come like we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check mate motherfucker
Game's over we won
Tweedle dee tweedle dum

Doesnt take much
For me to race up and stank up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You don't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Like smearin bloodstains with a paint brush
I can't explain what it is my brain does
But however it works its insane just plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that's dangerous
It's a whole combination of things
It takes nuts
And I'm not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
I'm paitently waitin for the day
I'm anxious
To see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
You're drunk you ain't tough
Whatever you drank musta just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talkin' motherfucker this ain't drugs
You wanna pop shit
Wake up
Then make up
Fuck that
It's to late chump now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calibur that nas and jay does
Opens up his jaws to say somethin' to rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
Till I peel the pain off
I never been shot but I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain
When they tried to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don't stop
Only thing that I wait for is the day that I don't gotta report to probate court
Cause ima give you all the reason to hate more
'Cause I've been holdin' my tongue till I got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list
It just ain't ja
And ima read the motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft cause 8 mile
When I come back
I'll be shootin more than just paint balls
Trust me

Monkey see monkey do
They'll never make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon always say and do
What the other one do
So let 'em come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see monkey do
Tweedle dee tweedle dum
If they really want it bad enough well then it gon' come
Now here they come like we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check mate motherfucker
Game's over we won
Tweedle dee tweedle dum

Fuckin' dummies
This ain't chess
You playin' motherfuckin checkers
This shit is all day man it's too easy
We playin' chess you playin' checkers
You bout to get your motherfuckin asses jumped
Fuckin' punks
And by the way
We ain't just talkin' to one person
We talkin' to every-motherfuckin-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bringin' it to anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don't pick up the ball if you don't wanna play man
It's all fucked up now
What the fuck am I s'posed to do now?
Huh?
What the fuck am I s'posed to do?
Haha
Yo we out
