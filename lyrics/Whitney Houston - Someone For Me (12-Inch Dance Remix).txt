(Someone for me...) 
(Someone for me...) 

I'm here alone on a Friday night, waiting here beside the phone;
The TV, radio, and me really ain't been getting along...
Mm, I wish that I could fly away, to party to the break of day,
And there I'll be sure to meet the guy that would be special to me...

Then Mama comes and asks me why am I dreaming, sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun? It's the only way I'll ever find someone for me,
While I am young and seventeen...

Someone for me! (Someone for me...)
I've got to find someone, someone... (Someone for me...) 
I've got to find someone, yeah!
Whoo!

Now there's a party down at Angie's house, with people packed against the wall;
I'm sitting in a corner here, trying to make some sense of it all...
And when I least expected meeting a guy I see in my dreams,
Here he is walking up to me, and asking if I'd like to come and dance with him;
I think I found someone for me...

Someone for me! (Someone for me...)
I've got to find someone, someone... (Someone for me...) 
I've got to find someone...

I need somebody for me, I need somebody for me, someone...

And so I'm finding out that dreams you believe in can come to be...
And now I'm looking up to find that joy and happiness can come to you and me;
At last I found someone for me...

Someone for me! (Someone for me...)
I need somebody for me, I need somebody for me, someone... (Someone for me...) 
Someone for me, someone for me, someone! (Someone for me...) 
Someone! Someone! Someone! Someone! Someone! Someone for me! (Someone for me...)
Somebody! Somebody! Somebody! Somebody, yeah, yeah! Hoo! (Someone for me...)
Oh! I need somebody for me, I need somebody for me, someone... (Someone for me...) 
Someone for me, someone for me, someone! (Someone for me...) 
Someone! Somebody! Someone! Somebody! Someone! Somebody for me! (Someone for me...)
Someone! Somebody! Someone! Someone for me... (Someone for me...)
Oh, oh... I need somebody for me...
