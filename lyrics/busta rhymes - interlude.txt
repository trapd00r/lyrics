Yes, indeed, yes, indeed out this motherfucker
Back with the right foot steppin' in first
And the left foot steppin' in after

I go by the divine attribute of bus-a-bust-down-some'n
Otherwise known as 'Busta-Motherfuckin'-Rhymes' out this bitch
Yknahmean? 'Cause when I'm in the spot

I let a bitch start kissin' up
And muh'fuckers love the way that I be pissin' up
On muh'fuckers, muh'fuckers need to chill, relax
What they need to do is listen up, muh'fuckers

So as we begin to get you addicted
To the shit that's 'So Addictive'
Make sure you got your peoples witchu
You know one of your peoples that stay sober

You know to make sure you get home safely
'Cause we about to take it there, muh'fuckers
Miss-E, 'Misdemeanor' Elliott, 'So Addictive'
