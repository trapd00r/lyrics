We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall
This time we got no-no-no-no future at all
They wanna ke-ke-keep us down but they can't hold us down anymore
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall

When we hit the bottom, then it goes up
Climb to the top with you
We're gonna be the breaks, once whoever waits
Ya I could be talking to you
They tryna hate, hate, hate
But we won't change, change anything at all
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall

They think we just dropped out
Living at my mom's house
Parents must be so proud
They know it all
They don't speak our language
They say we're too savage
No, no we don't need them anymore

We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall
They don't speak our language
They say we're too savage, ya
No, no we don't need them anymore
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall

So we're going no-no-no-no-no-no nowhere
But we they don't know know know is we don't don't care
We're gonna keepin' on, keepin' on going till we can't go no more
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall

When we hit the bottom, then it goes up
Climb to the top with you
We're gonna be the breaks, once whoever waits
Ya I could be talking to you
They tryna hate, hate, hate
But we won't change, change anything at all
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall

They think we just dropped out
Living at our mom's house
Parents must be so proud, they know it all
No, hey don't speak our language
They say we're too savage
No, no we don't give a- anymore

We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall
They don't speak our language
They say we're too savage, ya
No, no we don't give a- anymore
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise till we fall
