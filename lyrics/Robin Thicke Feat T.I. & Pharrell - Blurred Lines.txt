Okay, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature

Just let me liberate you (hey, hey, hey)
You don't need no papers (hey, hey, hey)
That man is not your maker (hey, hey, hey)
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl!

Hustle gang homie! 
Let's go, I said rock! 

One thing I ask you
Let me be the one you back that ass up to (come on)
Go from Malibu to Paris, boo
Yeah, I had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you

So hit me up when you passing through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on, even when you dress casual
I mean it's not almost unbearable

In a hundred years not dare would I 
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

So I'm just watching (just watching)
And waiting (and waiting) for you to salute
The true big pimpin' 
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
But I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'!
