It's making me do things,
I don't want to do.
It's poisoning me, weakening me,
You can't see.
It's lessening, like you.
I'm still listening.
Still listening.

Rescue me,
Won't you, won't you?
It's getting so late, uh
I can't see
I'm begging you;
I'm still listening

I believed you.
Oh, I wanted to.
And it was wonderful,
So beautiful,
All gave in.
Release me.

Rescue me, won't you? ohhhuuu
It's getting so late, uh
I can't see.
I'm telling you;
I'm still listening.

I believed you.
Oh, I wanted to.
But it's poisoning me, weakening me.
You can't see.
It's lessening.

Rescue me, won't you?
It's getting so late,
I can't see.
I'm telling you;
I'm still listening.

I'm still, still, still, still, still
Still, still, still, still, still
Listening, listening, listening
Still, still, still, still, still, still

You're not listening!
