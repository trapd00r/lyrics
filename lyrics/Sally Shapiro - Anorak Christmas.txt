The first time that I saw your face
On a cold December night
It was a Tuesday on a gig
With a band that we both liked
The first time that I heard you
Say your name and I said mine
I fell in love
And ever since
You've been here on my mind

Please don't go
I love you so
I want to kiss you
I need to kiss you

The weekend's over
And I feel the strangest way because
I can't remember my own name
But I do remember yours
There are no words in any language
For feelings just like this
Will I end up by myself
Or in the perfect kiss

Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
