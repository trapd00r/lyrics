He´s travelling from town to town He´s preaching what he can
No evil spell can bring him down Cause he´s a holy man

He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man
He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man

When he rode into Jerusalem The people said: Hello
They screamed at him: How do you do? And he said: I don´t know

I´m a holy man, I´m a holy man I´m a holy man, I´m a holy man

And the stones, they knew And the trees, they knew
And the girls an boys They whispered it, too

He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man
He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man
They build three crosses upon a hill
The sky was overcast
The earth did quake a little bit
Some birds fell down at last
And the water knew
And the fire, too
And the winds, they blew
Be true, be true
He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man
He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man
He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man
He´s a holy man, he´s a holy man
