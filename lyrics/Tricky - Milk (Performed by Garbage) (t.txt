(Note: this is a slower version of the garbage track with both parties
Involved singing all the lines, part of a rthyhm track starts then buckles
And diappears.)

I am milk
I am red hot kitchen
And I am cool
Cool as the deep blue ocean
I am lost
So I am cruel
But I'd be love and sweetness
If I had you

I'm waiting (x2)
For you
(x2)


I am weak
But I am strong
And I will use my tears to bring you home

I'm waiting (x2)
For you
(x3)

I am milk

And I am cool
Cool as the deep blue ocean

I'm waiting
For you

(Till fade)
