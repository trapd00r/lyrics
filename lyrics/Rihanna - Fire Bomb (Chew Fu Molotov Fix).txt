Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm going
I gotta get where I'm going, take off my mask to breathe

You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the breaks was the last to leave
That's the thing
Where I'm going, I don't need my brakes

Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
'Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire so I won't have to burn alone
Then you, then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold but baby, know it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful when its through, it's the other half of me

I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing
Where we're going, we don't need no brakes

Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
'Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire so I won't have to burn alone
Then you, then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby, we were killing them
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning the world called the police

Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy, 'cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing

The lovers need to clear the road
'Cause this thing is ready to blow

I just wanna set you on fire so I won't have to burn alone
Then you, then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
