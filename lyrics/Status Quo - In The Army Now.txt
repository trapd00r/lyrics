A vacation in a foreign land
Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Now you remember what the draft man said
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

You'll be the hero of the neighbourhood
Nobody knows that you left for good
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Smiling faces as you wait to land,
But once you get there no one gives a damn
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Hand grenades flying over your head - - - - - -
Missiles flyin' over your head if you wanna survive,
get out of bed 
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army, now

Shots ring out in the dead of night
The sergeant calls : "Stand up and fight!"
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

You got your orders standing to shoot on sight
Your finger's on the trigger but it don't seem right
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now

Night is falling and you just can't see
Is this illusion or reality
You're in the army now
Oh, oh you're in the army - now
