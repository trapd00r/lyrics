All the drops on his cheek
Are frozen up
Watch his heart
Turning into rock
Walks for hours
Burning desire
Soft and deep and
Counting shades of quiet
Living in your fire, Living as fire
Test myself like a nuclear site
I'm tired of my insides
Put my filters on

I'm a flashlight, I'm a flash of light (x6)

I fly to hit the sky
Flying so high I look down at the sky
I look down at the sky

Feast your eyes on my little petal
Put my firefly on the mantel
Had to pass you by without flying
How do I say goodbye to a firefly?
How do I say goodbye to a firefly?

Flashlight, I'm a flash of light
I'm a flashlight, I'm a flash of light (x3)

I fly to hit the sky
Flying so high I look down at the sky
I look down at the sky
I look down at the sky


Easier to look outside
All these needs
No tears spill all over
Shake away to
To stare over

I'm a flashlight, I'm a flash of light

Oh my firefly (x4)
How do I say goodbye to a firefly? (x3)
How do I say, say, say, say, say
How do I say goodbye to a firefly?
How do I say goodbye to a a a firefly?
