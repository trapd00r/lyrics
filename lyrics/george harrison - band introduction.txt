I'd like to introduce you to a few people up here
Everybody here came on very short notice and some people even, uh, cancelled a few gigs to try and make it and nobody is getting paid for anything
Uh
We got on drums, Ringo Starr
Also on drums, Jim Keltner
There's somebody on bass who've many people have heard about, but they never actually seen him, Klaus Voorman
We've got a whole lot of guitarists
Uh, Mister Jesse Ed Davis, an old friend of mine, Mister Eric Clapton
And then, thank you, thank you
Somebody, I'm sure you all know by now, on piano, Leon
Stand up, Leon
I don't know if they're coming through on acoustic guitars, if you're hearing them, but it's, uh, an Apple band, Badfinger
And again, a whole lot of uh, singers out there
The singers, um, are all from all different parts of the world and different bands, uh
And just give them a big hand
I don't know what to do
And the Hollywood horn players over there led by Jim Horn
And have we forgotten anybody? Oh, yeah? We've forgotten Billy Preston
