Get down get get get down
'Cause the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
Get down
The bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
'Cause the bomb and the funk is about to get down

Up from the roof - 100% proved
B.O.Dubb - giving it nuff
Push and a shove - burning hot
You're brain starts to rattle and you're nerves get shocked
You get scared but it's just the take off
It's all funky like the odor in you're underarm
Loosen up 'cause we're about to make your head nod
And all you freaks grab a hold of your nuts
Here we come the one's on the run
Came back for more 'cause we just ain't done
It's the funk addictive like skunk
Gotta have some and put the rest to the trunk
We deliver the brand new formula
It won't be long till everybody wants a
Piece of this you ask what it is
It's the way of the flow that throws away you missories

Yep yep with yep and a yep yep
U don't stop 'cause we come with a kingstep
So make a room, make a room, make a room now
'Cause the bomb and the funk is about to get down

Get down get get get down
Get down
'Cause the bomb and the funk is about to get down

Straight ahead - levels onna red
You want action well that's what you get
It's a effect of direct approach that you cope even if ya ruffneck
The ingredients - hard funk dividends
Make you move even if you don't wanna dance
We bring the heat and cut you up open
There'll be no pretending I'll leave the mic smoking
Operation bigger than the bang-
The freestyler nigga with an other dope jam
You go damn - taught we couldn't hang.
Now here's how it goes I make you understand
These lyrics combined with spirit
Spread all around all the major cities
You can't avoid the new sound boy
It's right here like the real MC coy

Yep yep with yep and a yep yep
U don't stop 'cause we come with a kingstep
So make a room, make a room, make a room now
'Cause the bomb and the funk is about to get down

Get down get get get down
'Cause the bomb and the funk is about to get down
Get down get get get down
Get down

We renovate you're whole mind state
Our boogie is the bomb sure to stimulate
But be cautious take small doses
We don't want you to hyperventilate
The speakers kick the riddim and the riff
Right on point - no question if
You feel the shakes - transform aches
Ain't nothing wrong the whole place vibrates

Yep yep with yep and a yep yep
U don't stop 'cause we come with a kingstep
So make a room, make a room, make a room now
'Cause the bomb and the funk is about to get down
