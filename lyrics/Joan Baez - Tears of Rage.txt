We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside, yeah
And put us on our way
Oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
Could treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot, yeah
Always tell him, "No"?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief

We pointed you the way to go
And scratched your name in the sand
But you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand
But I want you to know that while we watched
You discover no one would be true
That I myself was among the ones who thought
It was just a childish thing to do
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low
And life is brief

It was oh so very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief
