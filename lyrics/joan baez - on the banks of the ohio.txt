I asked my love to take a walk
To take a walk, just a little walk
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the old Ohio

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the old Ohio

I held a knife against her breast
As in my arms she pressed
She cried, "Oh, Willie, don't murder me
I'm not prepeared for eternity"

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the old Ohio

I started home 'tween twelve and one
I cried, "My God, what have I done?
Killed the only woman I loved
Because she would not be my bride"

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the old Ohi
