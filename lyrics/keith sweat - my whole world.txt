I wanna kick it off something, girl, like this to you
Yeah, come on
Here we go

My whole world has turned around (Mmm, hmm)
Ever since you walked into my life (Mmm, oh'oh'baby)
My whole world has turned around (My, my, baby)
Ever since you walked into my life (Let me kick it like this to you)

No more lonely days [No more lonely days]
And no more, girl, lonely nights [No more lonely nights]
Ever since I met you, baby, oh, yeah
Everything is, oh, so right, oh, my baby

My whole world has turned around
Ever since you walked into my life (Ever since you came along, oh, yeah)
My whole world has turned around
Ever since you walked into my life (Yeah, let me kick the second verse)

You got everything, baby [You got everything]
Any man could want from a woman, oh, yes, you do [Oh, yes, you do]
Girl, let me lay my everything, baby, baby [I wanna lay it on you, girl]
My everything right down on you

My whole world has turned around (My)
Ever since you walked into my life (Ever since you walked into my life, baby)
My whole world (My whole world) has turned around (My whole world)
