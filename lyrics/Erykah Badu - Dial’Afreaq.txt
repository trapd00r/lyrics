Scientists found the cause of the world sudden dying population of bees is related to cell phones
The bees sense cell phone signals transmitted when the phones ring
Causing them to emit heavy buzzing noises
This frequency confuses the bees, making them fly erratically
Bees use the earth's magnetic field as a compass, but their navigation is now compromised by cell phone radiation
Making it impossible for them hoes to find their way back to the hive
It is unlikely that the world will ever, ever, ever relinquish the convenience of cell phones
