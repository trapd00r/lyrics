At a time when the world seems to be
Spinning hopelessly out of control
There's deceivers and believers

And old in-betweeners
That seem to have no place to go

Well it's the same old song
It's right and it's wrong
And livin' is just something I do
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hands on the wheel
Of something that's real
And I feel like I'm goin' home

And in the shade of an oak
Down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Settin' sails, spinnin' tails
And fishin' for whales
With a lady that they both enjoy

Well it's the same damn tune
It's the man in the Moon
It's the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

And I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hands on the wheel
Of something that's real
And I feel like I'm goin' home
