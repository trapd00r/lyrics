You always lived in the fumes
Of your own fantasies
Just like an old perfume,
Which lingers on your skin
 
Let's stop smoking boy
You always do, whatever you want
Tired of smoking boy
You always said you'd stop
But you never could, you never could
 
I wanna be healthy like this Australian girl
That I've met one day
Late in a corner cafe
She was drinking green juice
And talking about the hammam,
Where she's gonna go tomorrow
With all her cool black friends
 
Let's stop smoking boy

Late in a corner cafe

And talking about the hammam
