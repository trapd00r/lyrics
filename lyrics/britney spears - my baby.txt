Tiny hands, yes, that's you
And all you show, it's simply true
I smell your breath, it makes me cry
I wonder how I've lived my life

'Cause without you
How did I get through?
All of my days without you?
Now living with you, see everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby, my baby, my baby

With no words at all, so tiny and small
In love I fall, so deep, so deep
My precious love, sent from above.
My baby boo, God I thank you, God I thank you

'Cause without you
How did I get through?
All of my days without you?
Now living with you, see everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby, my baby, my baby

'Cause without you
How did I get through?
All of my days without you?
Now living with you, see everything's true
My baby, it's you
(My baby, it's you)
My baby, my baby, my baby
