Oh, God where have you gone?
Why did you leave me all alone?
I'm slowly dying

The traitor stabbed my back
So what I ask you know it's to give me a chance
To get my revenge

Just send me an angel from the sky
To dry my tears of pain
An all the blood I shed today
Won't be in vain

I'm still reminded of his face
How he came to me with all his grace
The Devil's kiss...

He promises gold an peace
And all the things I always dreamt for years
And now I lie here

Just send me an angel from the sky
To dry my tears of pain
An all the blood I shed today
Won't be in vain

Until the light embrace my soul
Until you come
To give me rest

Tonight I'm here
Before my wings will fall broken
Please fly to me
Give me a new reason to live

Just send me an angel from the sky
To dry my tears of pain
An all the blood I shed today
Won't be in vain
