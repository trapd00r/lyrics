uess who's back?!?!

ommy! We're home!!

ay hello to my little friends

J Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill

verybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!!!


Verse - Eminem]

verywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck

ourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was

0, Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us

hey pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does

rom New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles

e've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust

ou may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us

t's funny, I guess money does have its advantages

nd it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched

t's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much

t's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch

e just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it

ause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that

ou fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at

hat you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it

o one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit

nd they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it

he noise from (?) be drowned out by the crowd

nd you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing

ill the club closes, and clears out

nd that's when they see you flatened

obody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping

nd you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping

t ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off

nd it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off


Chorus - Eminem]
