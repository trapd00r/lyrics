I was a loser then but I'm a winner now
I'll do it all again 'Cause now I know how
How everything in life comes down to this
At last Survivin' and livin'
Determined not to give in, and

I'm still alive my life is rolling on
Gently from day to day memories will fade away, yes
I'm still alive the agony is gone
And my mind is slowly wakin' qnd my heart has ceased its achin'
I'm still alive

I took so many blows (I took so many blows)
I cried a sea of tears
And only heaven knows (And only heaven knows)
How I could stand the fear
I think of all the nights I lay alone and scared
All shattered and cryin' and thinkin' I was dyin'
But,

I'm still alive My life is rolling on
Gently from day to day memories will fade away, yes
I'm still alive the agony is gone
And my mind is slowly wakin' and my heart has ceased its achin'
I'm still alive
