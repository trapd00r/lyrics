"The Dogg Pound and the LBC, your baby is awaiting you..."
[Girl]:
That's that damn Snoop Dogg again, he ain't nothin' but a fuckin' pimp
[Boy]:
Man snoop you got a bad curve, when I grow up I wanna be just like you
[Snoop]:
Look here little homeboy, let me tell you somethin',
Don't let me ever hear you say you wanna be like me,
You could be a doctor, a lawyer, a football player, a laker, anythin',
Just don't never let me hear you say you want to be like me,
You hear me?
[Boy]:Yah Huh
[Snoop]:Now take these dollar$ and go giv'em to your brothers and sisters
And you run on to school
[Boy]:Thanks Snoop.
