Are u listenin is anybody listenin
walk into a room and u can smell the Clive Christian scent
alot of niggaz is threatened by my position in
thriller bars u think im writing wit jon grisham pen
i need ros√© never mind the price in
know we brought cake to the party no icing
no ice on big phantom no license
fuck if your feeling me as long as yo wife is
no one in my city got a pocket like drizzy
i can rock fitted jeans cuz my credit card skinny
its pitch black and colors all incidental 
and ms. wrong sorry u aint know its my potential
fuck yall rappers and your self-proclaim status
i can only see green now happy St. Patty's
i know waitin on a last quote 
check the soundscan and u can see that im the last hope


By the way im jewish and turnin 22
gets depressing wen u see yo favorite rappers goin thru it
tryin re-invent themselves showin no improvement
gettin crushed by this lite skin young and on sum new shit 
40 just recorded and we'll drop this here
cuz im tryin fuck meagan fox this year
and if u got a style is the cop u gear
u in my age bracket and u not my peer
yea fuck u really no about a ??? couch
frontin sheets perfect touch u a clean house
wide awake but a nigga living yo dreams out
lookin like a photo shoot eveytime the teams out 
and is the realest nigga still I 
a women could love me 2 death but ill still die
so im about us now 
smith and wesson flow u should tell them boys duck down
