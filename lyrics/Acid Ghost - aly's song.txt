I don't think i should call you a friend
You're just someone i know
But i don't wanna know
Know you anymore

Crazy thoughts
Through the night
Forget it all
Out of your sight
Wish i could be
In your mind
Instead I'm
Out of your sight

I didn't need you
You didn't care
I should've left you
It wasn't fair

How can you do that
Broke my heart
You played me
From the start
