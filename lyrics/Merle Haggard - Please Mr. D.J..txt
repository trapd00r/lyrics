Hello Mr. D.J., won't you play a song for me?
The girl I love just said goodbye and I'm blue as I can be
Oh please Mr. D.J., play that song I heard you play
And send it out to someone who broke my heart today

You won't have to call her name, she'll know it's meant for her
Play me that song of sadness and I'll be grateful to you sir
Oh please Mr. D.J., play that song I heard you play
And send it out to someone who broke my heart today

You won't have to call her name, she'll know it's meant for her
Play me that song of sadness and I'll be grateful to you sir
Oh please Mr. D.J., play that song I heard you play
And send it out to someone who broke my heart today
