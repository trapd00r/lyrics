What have I done?

You are my everything
My head, my heart, my mind, my wing
I could give all again
I'm never short of anything with you

The jokes, the laugh, the teardrops too
The games, the fun, the travels too
Yes I'll go through it all with you*
All good things now come from you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard
For you?

I give my everything
My head, my heart, my mind, my wing
The past the present tomorrow too
I'll spend my final day with you

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard
For you?

I hope you feel the way I do
I hope you give yourself up too
I'm damned to feel the way I do
What have I done to fall so hard
For you?

* Acoustic version: "Yes I will do them all with you"
