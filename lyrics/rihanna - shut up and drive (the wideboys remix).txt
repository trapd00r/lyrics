I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

Cos I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys-

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

I got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got all the drive but a whole lot'a boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy I wish you would

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

Cos I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys-

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Cos your Maybach, ain't got what I got (get it get it)
Don't stop, it's a sure shot
And your Ferrari, huh oh, boy I'm sorry
I ain't even worried
So step inside and ride
(ride, ride, ride, ride, rideâ€¦)

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Got you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
Got a ride that smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy then we can go all night

Cos I'm zero to sixty in three point five
Baby you got the keys-

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)
