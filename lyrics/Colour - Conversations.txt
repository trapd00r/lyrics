Is your favourite colour blue? 
And do you always tell the truth? 
Do you believe in outer space? 
I'm learning you 

Is your skin as tan as mine? 
Does your hair flow side ways? 
Did someone take a portion of your heart? 
Now I'm learning you 

And if you don't mind can you tell me all your hopes & fears 
And everything that you believe in 
Would you make a difference in the world 
I'd love for you to take me to a deeper conversation 
Only you can make me.... 

I've let my guard down for you 
And in time you will too 

And if you don't mind can you tell me all your hopes & fears 
And everything that you believe in 
Would you make a difference in the world 
I'd love for you to take me to a deeper conversation 
Only you can make me.... 

And if you don't mind can you tell me all your hopes & fears 
And everything that you believe in 
Would you make a difference in the world 
I'd love for you to take me to a deeper conversation 
Only you can make me.... 

Deeper conversation with me ( x3 ) 
Deeper conversation.... 

Does your name rhyme with mine?
