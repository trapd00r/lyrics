(Spoken) Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky.1

Ooooooooooooooooooh

Did did did did you see the frightened ones
Did did did did you hear the falling bombs
Did did did did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky

Ooooooooooooooooooh

Did did did did you see the frightened ones
Did did did did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long-gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye
