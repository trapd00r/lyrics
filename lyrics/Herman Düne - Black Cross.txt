I'm waiting for the good luck to come down on me
I'm waiting for the good luck to come down on me
I'm waiting for the good luck to come down on me
I'm waiting for the good luck to come down on me
I'm sitting at the crossroad, looking at the black cross
I'm here at the cross road, looking at the black cross
I'm sitting at the crossroad, sunny day luck
I'm sitting on a dead log, looking at the black cross
And I know when the rider will come
And I know when the rider will come
Proud like a king, riding on a dead horse
Proud like a king, riding on a dead horse
And I hold a ring in my dead hand
And I hold a ring in my dead hand
