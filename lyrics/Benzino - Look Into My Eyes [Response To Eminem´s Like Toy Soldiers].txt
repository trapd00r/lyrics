Look into my eyes and you will see: (My Struggle my pain)
My life my pain and the things that made me (made me who I am)
There's no other place that I would rather be (Benzino) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me...

(Benzino Speaking)
This one's for the world, my people
U think you know me? U have no idea who I am, This is my story
It's not about the magazine (no), about my baggy jeans (no) and my braidz (no) and my jewelery (ah ah), the money: nah, (non of that) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me

(Verse one)
It wasn't long ago when it all began
Standin' in the graveyard while they buried my men
It's when I first understood how this game was played
Either kill a nigga quick or you might get played
Street was never was that big, the hood's even smaller
Grew up in the projects that moved the four quarters
Pop's went to prison, I knew about the system
Every Sunday morning, me and mom's paid a visit
He was heavy in the streets maybe mafia connected
All I'm gonna say he was very well respected
They called me raydog, yeah that's Titos son
I met a lot of great men for many years to come
I'm gettin' money on my block all night
Runnin' with a bunch of niggaz born to fight, Nigga!
Boston was the first on the east to really bang out
Niggaz wanted streets while them automatics rang out

Look into my eyes and you will see: (My life my pain)
My life my pain and the things that made me (There's no other place)
There's no other place that I would rather be (That's right) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me...

(Verse two)
Now fucking with these niggaz on the other side of town
The allmighty spalms, we the hottest click around
Jewelery was heavy niggas rolled thirty thick
Artillery was heavy niggas, Jake standn' on my dick
And I'm squeezin all types of guns, what eva
Mom's keeps cryin', but that's the life of thugs
And that's the life I love, I'm addicted to it
Street life, real thug niggaz makin' rap music
I met Dave at the radio, he cool
Started the source mag, always had to be in school
It was one piece of paper then they grew in to a book
But I had my own paper, cause my block was a look
I caught I couple of Benz, I'm fighting court cases
It was news at eleven, or in the news papers
Investigation federal, I knew it from the start
I knew that jealousy and envy tore my crew apart

Look into my eyes and you will see: (My life my pain)
My life my pain and the things that made me (There's no other place)
There's no other place that I would rather be (That's right) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me...

(Verse three)
If money is the root of all evil then burn it
Or get up off you ass mothafucka and earn it
I moved to New York, It was time to make it happen
Dave is my dog and yeah zino's still rappin'
I walk trough the valley of death with no fear
I'm holding Dave down till the niggaz's outta here (beleve that)
I breath fore my niggaz disease, holding in
Exhale all the anger that I'm holding within
To many people in my life, never coming back (no)
It's never where you from, it's only where standin' now
Got a few good niggaz, a box of ammunition, that's all I really need for me to carry out a mission
If Eminem wanna squash beef tell him call me (where you at?)
Meet him any where, he can bring his whole army (Bring em')
The day will soon come when the world recognize
Zino is the realist, since Pac been alive

Look into my eyes and you will see: (My life my pain)
My life my pain and the things that made me (There's no other place)
There's no other place that I would rather be (I didn't chose this life) I didn't choose this life, this life chose me...(yeah yeah)

(Benzino Speaking)
Yeah Troy you did it on this one nigga, believe that, yeah the Arch nemesis
In the hood me and you, yeah believe that, this is my story
