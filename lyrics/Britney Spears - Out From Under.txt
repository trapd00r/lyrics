Breathe you out, breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me you're the one who could've been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears

Try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

So let me go, just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us grow deeper and much darker everyday
Watch me now, and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you

Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I told a thousand times

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

From under, from under
From under, from under

And part of me still believes when you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes we can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye forever

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
That maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under

I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under

From under, from under
From under, from under
