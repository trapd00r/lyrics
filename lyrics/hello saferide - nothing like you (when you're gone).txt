I swear: I felt it again
the tingling of the first night again
Us moving slowly, Merle Haggard, the fading sun
Well, there's nothing like you when you're gone

I wear your sweatshirt again
The one with the cast of Falcon Crest on
The one I forbade you to use time and again
Well it's sad, I keep putting it on

A friend stopped by and said as quoted:
"I can't believe that we're here again
Have you forgotten the women, the drinking, the Blues of the Eighties collection
Oh my God, you're wearing your Lorenzo Lamas again"
M-hm

Yes, I am lonesome again!
Yes, I am crying again!
Yes, you are getting this letter again
Because there's nothing like you when you're gone

Never as tender and never as well dressed
never as handsome and never as good in bed
never had such good taste
never as much like me
Well, there's nothing like you when you're gone
