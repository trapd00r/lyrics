Lover, lover, let's pretend we're born as innocents
Cast into the world with apple eyes
To wish, wish dangerous, my dear, delirious
To try and leave the rest of us behind

Shot full of diamonds and a million years
The disappointed disappear as if they were never here

Kiss, kiss all of this, the hiss that we had missed
And understand what can't be understood
Sear those thoughts of me, alone and unhappy
I never liked me anyway

If by chance or circumstance, we should fall, don't be so sad
Shot full of diamonds and a million years
The disappointed disappear like they were never here

In a dream, we are connected
Siamese twins at the wrist
Then I knew we had been forsaken, expelled from paradise
I can't believe them when they say it's all right

Words can't define what I feel inside
Who needs them?
Caught with this virus of my mind
I give in to my disease of my needs
To my disease of my needs

She really loves to break, her dad says it's okay
She really loves to break, and give it all away
Her mom says she's a flake, what more can she be?
She really needs to break, and give us all away

She gave it all away
She gave it all away
She gave it all away
We really love the U.S.A.
