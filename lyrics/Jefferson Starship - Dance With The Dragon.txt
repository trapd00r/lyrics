All right
It makes you wanna get away,
You know you got to stay.
Looking for love, but you know it ain't easy.
Looking for freedom and everybody needs it.
All the young dudes, in jail,
Will remember when the laws are finally changed,
And they'll wonder, 'bout Oscar,
Who spent five years in a Texican jail.
What do you say?
What about you?
Baby what-cha gonna do, 'bout Mary Lou?
She died in Santa Rita, Billy shot it out in Alameda.
It makes you wanna get away,
You know you got to stay.
Lookin' for love but you know it ain't easy.
Dance with the dragon it's the year that it breathes.
Oh slow fire. slow fire,
'Nam vets, scared yet,
Heroes dreams and broken bayonets.
No choice,
No voice,
I got to find a reason for my heart to rejoice.
Yankee Doodle get it up,
And stick a feather in your hat.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
And call it macaroni.
Yankee Doodle get it up,
And stick a feather in your hat.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
And call it macaroni.

I wanna get away,
I know I got to stay.
Lookin' for love, but you know it ain't easy.
Dance with the dragon it's the year that it breathes
Slow Fire. Slow Fire.
All Right.
Dragon year,
So clear,
The sound of wings burnin' in my ear.
Is it the rising sun,
Is it the settin' sun?
Dance with the dragon 'til the year is done.
Yankee Doodle get it up,
And stick a feather in your hat.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
And call it macaroni,
Yeah Yeah Yeah.
I can see by the smile on your face that you know what I mean.
If you can hear me, won't you come near me whenever you can?
And it all gets down to love.
Love is hard.
Love is hard.
Love is hard.
Love is hard.
