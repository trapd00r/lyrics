Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive... and the world turning inside out Yeah!
And floating around in ecstasy 
So don't stop me now, don't stop me
Cos' I'm having a good time having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky 
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity 
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva 
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me 
I'm burning through the sky Yeah! 
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you 

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time 
I'm having a ball, don't stop me now 
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call 
Don't stop me now (because I'm having a good time) 
Don't stop me now (yes I'm having a good time) 
I don't want to stop at all

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course 
I am a satellite I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload 
Like an atom bomb about to 
Oh oh oh oh oh explode 

I'm burning through the sky Yeah!, two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit 
I'm travelling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you 

Don't stop me, don't stop me 
Don't stop me, hey hey hey! 
Don't stop me don't stop me oooh oooh oooh (I like it)
Don't stop me don't stop me 
Have a good time good time 
Don't stop me don't stop me Ah 

I'm burning through the sky, Yeah! two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you 
Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball don't stop me now 
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call 
Don't stop me now (because I'm having a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes I'm having a good time)
I don't want to stop at all
