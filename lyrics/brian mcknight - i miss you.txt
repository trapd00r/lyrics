I can't remember why we fell apart,
from something that was so meant to be.
Forever was the promise in our hearts.
Now more and more I wonder where you are.

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
I miss you.

Still have your picture in a frame,
hear your footsteps down the hall.
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane.
How I wish that you would call to say....

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
I miss you.
I miss you.
I miss you.

Lonelyness and heartache.
Crying myself to sleep.
Wondering 'bout tomorrow, 
won't you come back to me,
come back to me.

Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind, anytime?
I miss you.

I miss you
