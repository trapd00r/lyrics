Wish I could lay down beside you
On a blanket in a park somewhere
With some music and some wine maybe
Your gentle arms around me

I wouldn't wish for anything more
Except that time would stand still

And I pretend
You were mine
And you'd never ever leave
And I would make you feel
The only place to be
Is where there's music, some wine and me

What if I could hold your hand and kiss you
And you'd feel nothing except we felt this right
You'd forget about time and spend the night
There, on a blanket in a park

And I pretend
You were mine
And you'd never ever leave
And I would make you feel
The only place to be
Is where there's music, some wine and me

And I pretend
You were mine
And you'd never ever leave
And I would make you feel
The only place to be
Is where there's music, some wine and me

And I pretend
You were mine
And you'd never ever leave
And I would make you feel
The only place to be
Is where there's music, some wine and me
