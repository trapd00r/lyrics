Charlotta making lasagna
With Mia above the clouds
Charlotta making lasagna
With Mia above the clouds
But you could have waited

You could have locked yourself up
For ten years or so
And when you finally came out
There would still be new chances for you

Charlotta running around with Felicia
Charlotta running around with Felicia
But you could have waited

You could have locked yourself up
For ten years or so
And when you finally came out
There would still be new chances for you

I look for moves and I search for breaths
And it leaves me
Thinking about death

I look for moves and I search for breaths
And it leaves me
Thinking about death

Beautiful sky
My car and we leave town for a while
You are a yellow surprise
Noticing water is friendly sometimes
But you could have waited

You could have locked yourself up
For ten years or so
And when you finally came out
There would still be new chances for you

But you could have waited (waited)
But you could have waited (waited)

I look for moves and I search for breaths
And it leaves me
Thinking about death

I look for moves and I search for breaths
And it leaves me
Thinking about death

Waited
Waited
Waited
