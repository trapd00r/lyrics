If travel is searching,
And home, what's been found...

If travel is searching,
And home, what's been found...

I'm not stopping.

I'm going hunting.
I'm the hunter.
I'll bring back the goods,
But I don't know when.

I thought I could organize freedom...
How Scandinavian of me!
You sussed it out, didn't you?

You could smell it,
So you left me on my own,
To complete the mission.
Now I'm leaving it all behind.

I'm going hunting.
I'm the hunter, I'm the hunter.
I'm going hunting.
I'm the hunter.
I'm the hunter.
I'm the hunter.
I'm the hunter.
I'm... the... hunter...
