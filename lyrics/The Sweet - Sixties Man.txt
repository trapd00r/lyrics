Take me now, I think I'm a simple man
Just need some loving and an easy living plan
But everyday now someone pulls my line
Shakes me up, says "Hey you gotta get in time"

Sunny days are over and gone for good
Shape up boy, you ain't working like you should
Well I know now I'm a man out of his place
Don't have a 1980's kind of face

'Cause I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
Woodstock nights, oh, where are you?
Strawberry Fields and San Francisco too
'Cause I'm a sixties man at heart and baby so are you
'Cause I'm a sixties man at heart and baby so are you

Flower power, you never knew much pain
Sitting 'round, loving in and loving out again
Oh, the seventies, I found I hardly knew
They left me high and dry and now I know why

'Cause I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
Woodstock nights, oh, where are you?
Strawberry Fields and San Francisco too
'Cause I'm a sixties man at heart and baby so are you
'Cause I'm a sixties man at heart and baby so are you
'Cause I'm a sixties man, Bob Dylan, oh, where are you?

I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
A sixties man at heart like you

'Cause I'm a sixties man, at last, I know it's true
A sixties man at heart like you
