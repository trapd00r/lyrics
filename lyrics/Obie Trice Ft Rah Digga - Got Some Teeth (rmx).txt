WOO!
Damn ...
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?
(*Crashing noise*)

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more focus, old pro's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, so a Heineken beer
Pull her to the side and invite here to "Cheers"
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepared for a player? You're workin with a MONSTER (*yelling*)
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind till your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to gape
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait
Let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight
Till your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin booty cheeks
C'mon

So this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
She caught me starin'
And my homies darin me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla 'cause I got a lot of dinerio
The DJ's playin' Obie song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't wanna be headin home
With some double D's full of silicone
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clowned me outside
Till I popped the trunk and they found me outside
Bustin' at the bitches screamin "off to they rides!"

So this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

Okay rolie polies everywhere (*horse naying noise*)
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literal (*crunching noise*)
-Ly, like a box of Cheerios
Carrot cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order 'cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split (*feet running away noise*)
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place to date
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes

(Obie Trice - talking)
Word to mother, that god damn okra and beans
Got ya Oprah in jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, I don't touch

So this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

(Outro - talking)
Haha, haha, ha
You gotta have teeth baby
It just wouldn't look right
Look, me big lips ...
You no teeth, it wouldn't work
You know what I'm sayin'
Haha ha, yeah
I'm feelin' good
Shady Records man
Obie Trice
C'mon
