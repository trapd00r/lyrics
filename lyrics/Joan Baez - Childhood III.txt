In the woods there is a bird
His song stops you and makes you blush

There is a clock that never strikes
There is a swamp with a nest of white beasts

There is a cathedral that goes down, and a lake that comes up
There is a little carriage abandoned in the copse
Or that goes running down the road beribboned

There is a troupe of strolling players in costume
Glimpsed on the road through the border of the woods
And then, when you are hungry and thirsty
There's someone who chases you away
