Missed the common life we had
Monday mornings and quiet nights

Being bored
Feeling fine
Was it gift if you ask me now
I never knew
When I had you

All the same
Whomever's to blame for this
I call love by
Your name

I take it's no use
That I miss you
Still calling love
By your name

You want apartment outside town
I miss Saturdays when your kids came by
Fussing hard to accept
But who can choose the love they get
I thought I could
You never measured up
Your life wasn't good enough
But who am I to judge you now

All the same
Whomever's to blame for this
I call love by
Your name

I take it's no use
But I miss you
Still calling love
By your name

All the same
Whomever's to blame for this
I call love by
Your name

I take it's no use
But I miss you
Still calling love
By your name
