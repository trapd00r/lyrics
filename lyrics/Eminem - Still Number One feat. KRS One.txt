[king tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture yâall
Brought to you by the woooorrrllld famous wake-up show!

[rza]
Bobby steels, stapleâ tails, mcâs get your lips stapled
Project killa hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You canât escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an m-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up!

[tech n9ne]
When I woke-up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the gâs in cali locâed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the drummonds, killer clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This big tech from the midwest, leavin mcâs lipless
On the wake-up show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? potna, you canât fuck wit the sniper
Your flowâs premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ainât nobody tighter
Sway & tech heard me flow and itâs sealed
Now I got swedish women yelling tech n9neâs filled

[eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cuz yâall canât see me like maseâs eyebrows (where you at? )
Climped out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
Hey thatâs my couch, bitch!
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While Iâm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
Youâre tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
Iâd rather just hump a slutâs leg wit my nuts shaved
And sway & tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man thatâs never gonâ fold
Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas tech & sway so you can wake-up
The x-man, catch me doin drills in the danger room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

[pharoahe monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as borris kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head wonât fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal? 
O, huh, c now like omar credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the wake-up show wit sway, tech and dj revolution

*dj revolution scratches*

[kool g rap]
I sway the tech wit the tech and sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sectâ arrays
Wake-up show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
Dj revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-ak
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decoraâ
Until the head of jake investigate

[jayo felony]
What? sway can give it to you, but whatcha gonâ do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but whatcha gonâ do? 
Rev can give it to you, but whatcha gonâ do wit it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what!

[chino xl]
Yo yo chino makes the world go âround
Fuckin up entire record companies like harrel did to motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama thatâs brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, thereâs nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like tony rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harrassment like tisha camp-bell
Youâre wack like will smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like jonbenet ramsey
Now who the master to beg? your demo gets passed on the regâ
You shouldnât have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
Iâm wake-up show reppin wit sway & tech
My tecâs like tekken, the industry weapon
Iâm chino x, bring krs in

[krs-one]
De de de de de de da di day, krs-one comin wit the tech & sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But Iâm willin to bet, on a sway & a tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what sway & tech do
Iâll be back but for now just sackle!
Fresh, for ninety-nine you suckas!!!
