im in heaven when you kiss me
show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
im in heaven when you kiss me
show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland

You capture me with a stare
I'll follow you anywhere
You lead me into temptation
I guess you need to enjoy
I'm like a kid with a toy
I'm losing my concentration
One kiss from you and I'm on fire
Your touch is all I desire
One look and you take me higher
You know I couldn't resist
Ya I miss...every time I'm with you 
Every time that we kiss

CHORUS:
I'm in heaven when you kiss
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I'm in heaven when you kiss
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I go crazy when you kiss me
Show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
You know I couldn't resist 
Ya I miss... every time I'm with you 
Everytime that we kiss

I dream of you every night
Feels like I'm losing my mind
The feelin's just getting stronger (ger, ger, ger, ger)
My head is spinnin' around
You play with me but I'm bound
I can't resist any longer

One kiss from you and I'm on fire
Your touch is all I desire
One look and you take me higher
You know I couldn't resist
Ya I miss...every time I'm with you 
Every time that we kiss

CHORUS:
I'm in heaven when you kiss
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I'm in heaven when you kiss
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I go crazy when you kiss me
Show me how you miss me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
You know I couldn't resist 
Ya I miss... every time I'm with you 
Everytime that we kiss

You know that I'm hypnotized
Each time I look in your eyes
You know I couldn't disguise
And I couldn't resist everytime that we kiss

CHORUS:
(I'm in)I'm in heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
Ooh it's heaven when you kiss me
Heaven when you kiss me
You were sent to me from Wonderland
I go crazy when you kiss me
Baby don't resist me
Take me with you back to Wonderland
You know I that I'm hypnotized... by your eyes
And I just can't resist 
Everytime that we kiss

You know I that I'm hypnotized... by your eyes
And I just can't resist 
Everytime that we kiss (kiss, kiss, kiss)
