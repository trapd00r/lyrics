Who wants to know
The thoughts of the one
They care for the most
Places they go

When their eyes are closed
I would be cautious
That's my one promise
I will be cautious

If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
Keep me in the dark
Keep me in the dark

I could love you
Like no one has
Not like the first time
I'll get close enough

If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
Don't shut out the light
If you have someone else in mind
Keep me in the dark
Keep me in the dark
Keep me in the dark

I will be cautious
That's my one promise
I will be cautious

Keep me in the dark
Keep me in the dark
