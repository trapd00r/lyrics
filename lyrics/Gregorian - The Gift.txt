Forgive is a word I am learning
If only to pass the time
I love you for all your weakness
I love you for all your lies
Will you grow
Will you understand
The damage you caused in time
The past is behind we are facing
A punishment for the crime

The gift you gave me
Our sweet encounter
Became so fragile and flew with the night
I will be witness
I will not falter
Till we are risen again to the light

Would you forgive me
My heart was broken
But I will mend I will be as before
Just give me one chance
To make it better
Uh let me be yours

Without you I'm weak and I'm listless
Without you I find I'm blind
I watch you alone, are you dreaming
Of happines left behind
Do you drift in your heart at night
Walk through the rooms of your mind
Open the door I'll be waiting
Remember this is your life

The gift you gave me
Our sweet encounter
Became so fragile and flew with the night
I will be witness
I will not falter
Till we are risen again to the light
