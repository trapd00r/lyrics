It must have been a place so dark you couldn't feel the light, 
Reaching for you through that stormy cloud. 
Now here we are gathered in our little home town. 
This can't be the way you meant to draw a crowd. 

Oh, why, that's what I keep asking. 
Was there anything I could have said or done. 
Oh, I had no clue you were masking a troubled soul. 
God only knows what went wrong. 
And why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song. 

Now in my mind I keep you frozen as a seventeen year old. 
Rounding third to score the winning run. 
You always played with passion, no matter what the game. 
When you took the stage you shined just like the sun. 

Oh, why, that's what I keep asking. 
Was there anything I could have said or done. 
Oh, I had no clue you were masking a troubled soul. 
God only knows what went wrong. 
And why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song. 

Now the oak trees are swaying in the early autumn breeze. 
The golden sun is shining on my face. 
The tangled thoughts I hear a mockingbird sing 
This whole world really ain't that bad of a place 

Oh why, there's no comprehending. 
And who am I to try to judge or explain 
Oh, but I do have one burning question 
Who you told you life wasn't worth the fight 
They were wrong, they lied. 
Now you're gone, and we cried. 

'Cause it's not like you to walk away in the middle of a song. 
Your beautiful song. 
Your absolutely beautiful song.
