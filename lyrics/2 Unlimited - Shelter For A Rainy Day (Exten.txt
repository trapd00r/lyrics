A: Oh....
R: Shelter on a rainy day
A: You may need me like I need you
A: I see the clouds gathing in the sky
When my worries, fill my mind
What to call us, begins to fade
I wanna be with you when it's starts to rain
'Cause I can hide in your arms
So safe and one
With you as my protection
To help me through the storm
A: You give me shelter on a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away
A: You've washed my tears away Yeh!
Yeah yeah
A: If inside your heart, it starts to rain
Just call me up, I ease the pain
You don't even need to be alone
When the wind, begins to mour
'Cause whenever you may need me, like I need you
Then let me be right by your side
If love will see it through
A: You give me shelter on a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away
A: You give me shelter on a rainy day
On a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away
R: A shelter on a rainy day
A lucky warm place, for you and I to stay
Hum, what you're thinking
No tell me no lies cause your eyes are blinking
There's a place girl, down deep in my heart
You know the feeling, a relationship to star
I send my love without delay
'Cause you  know I got a shelter on a rain day
A: You give me shelter
Your love has washed them all away
A: You give me shelter on a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away
A: You give me shelter on a rainy day
On a rainy day
You are all that I'm needed
When clouds are turning grey
You give me shelter
You give me shelter on a rainy day
My tears have lost they meaning
Love have washed them all away
