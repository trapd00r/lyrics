Walk on by,
The house where you still live,
Walk on by,
The place where we would kiss,

And the room where,
I held you tight,
Tonight,
I must walk on by,

Yeah, walk on by,
The room where you still sleep,
Walk on by,
The company that you keep,

And the room where,
I held you tight,
Tonight,
I must walk on by,

Yeah, somehow, I know,
No, I won't forget you,
No, no, no, no, no,
I won't,

You won't forget me,
No, no, no, no, no, no,

I'll keep on walking,
Away from here,
I'll forget you when I reach,
The other side,

Walk on by,
The house where you still live,
Walk on by,
The place where we would kiss,

And the room where,
I held you tight,
Tonight,
I must walk on by,

And the room where,
I held you tight,
Tonight,
I must walk on by...
