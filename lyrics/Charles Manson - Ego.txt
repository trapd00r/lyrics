It's in, side
It's in the back
The front
No it's in the back
No it's in the front
No it's in the back
They shoved it in the back
They put it in the back
All the love in the back in the back
All the love in the back
Get in the back boy

And they call it your subconscious
TALK:
Remember Freud
In the front is your computer
And I call him 
SING:
Old ego is a too much thing
Old ego is a too much thing
He'll make you fool yourself
You'll think you're somebody else
They got the whole subway train
Makes you want to jump on up there an' fight
And you can't stand left to your right

He'll make you lie
Make you cheat
Jus' so you won't be beat
He'll make you get on outta sight
You get afraid you gonna, act like a clown
And you get mad when somebody puts you down

Your heart's a-pumpin' and you pan-heart's a-jumpin'
Look out ego is a too much thing
When everything seems goin' so fine
Old ego puts itself on a bind
Your cert'ty turns to doubt
Then you start flippin' out
Then you ease on out of your mind
