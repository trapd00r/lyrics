I met a girl down at the disco.
She said "Hey, hey, hey yeah let's go"
I could be your baby, you can be my honey
Let's spend time not money
And mix your milk wit my cocoa puff
Milky, milky cocoa,
Mix your milk with my cocoa puff, milky, milky right

Fergie
They say I'm really sexy
The boys they wanna sex me
They always standin' next to me
Always dancin' next to me
Tryin' to feel my hump, hump
Lookin' at my lump, lump
You can look but you can't touch it
If you touch it I'm-a start some drama
You don't want no drama
No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama
So don't pull on my hand boy
You ain't my man boy
I'm just tryin' to dance boy
And move my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump

In the back and in the front
