I need you pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win, 
I need to know where I'm headed, 
'Cause I know where I been

Flows, bones crushin', it's nothin'
I come up with sum'n
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'
It's sum'n you want
745 chrome spinnin's,
Haters hate that I'm winnin'
Man, I been hot from the beginnin'

Muthafuckas, envy the kid
Control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control ma temper
I'm in to catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie
I'm down to get it top
Who wants to squeeze da first shot
You know I ain't stop, 'til ma clip is empty
I'm simply, 
Not that nigga used to try your luck, 
What da fuck, wait--
Holla tip shells is strup
Wit' yo bones broke, gun smokin', still open, 
What-nigga lay yo ass down, paramedics get ya up

Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

I almost lost my bigga nigga, and
I didn't cry
Too young to understand
The consequences of a man
Livin' a lie, I,
Gotta get that money, I be damnin' from bummin'
Gotta watch my back around these niggas
'Cause they fun in 20 years
And watchin' ma momma tears, got me heated
Heavenly weeded
Smokin' that bomb, 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me ballin' they want me buried
Balled in the dirt from shots flurried
Layin' wit' bombs all on my shirt
I got plans to hop up in da Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder
When dem angels gon' call my number
Under
My chest is a heart of a lion, lion, lion
Pound me, honeys got me flyin'
Wit' my iron
Eyes are giant
I'm runnin' from nuthin'
My stomach is touchin'
While I'm clutchin'
To give you more than a concussion
End the discussion
My brothers told me so I'm bolder
And to see a solder
Hurt on my shoulder
Look in the mirror
I see a soldier

Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This I shit that I saw with my eye balls, my ears
This is me who's gotta be
What you see on TV
What you hear on CD
What appears easy
Man, these teeny-boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies, in these rags
Live in fantasies, frontin'
Like its all fun 'n games, 
'Til the shoot-'em-up, bang
And you see your brains hang,
And you see we ain't playin',
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night 'n ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game
And I'm done playin', man
I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin'
I'ma start, layin' any of dese, mothafuckin' cocksuckas
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward,
I can't 
How would I look as a man, bowin' to his knees,
Like the mad cow disease
Let somebody lash out at me,
And not lash back out at 'em
Please, 
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall?
I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you jus' pick it apart
So I see I hafta start
Showin' you fuckin' old farts
A whole other side, 
I wanted to not show you,
So you know you not
Dealin' with some fuckin' marshmallow
Little, soft, yellow, punk pussy whose heart's Jell-o (kuz)

Right now, I'm on da edge
So don't push me
I aim straight fo' yo head
So don't push me
Fill yo ass up with lead
So don't push me
I got sum'n fo' yo ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
