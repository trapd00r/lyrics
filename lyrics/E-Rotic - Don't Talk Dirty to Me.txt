Touch me with your love 
And give me satisfaction 
When we get into action 
But dont talk dirty 
Take me in your arms 
And go for my obsession 
And give me all your passion 
Dont talk dirty to me 

Oh touch me 
But dont talk dirty to me 
Oh baby touch me 

Hey keep it cool cos thats the rule 
Im your lover baby not your fool 
Everything I ever knew 
So let my body talk to you 
Im in love with you I know it hurts 
If lovers use four letter words 
Im gonna use my heart and soul 
Its just to make you lose control 

Oh Dont talk dirty to me 
Just touch me 


Oh You gotta touch me baby 
Dont talk dirty 

Dont wanna lose you  Hey keep close 
Baby Im the one  Im the one you chose 
Ill always treat you like a jewel 
Tell you baby  Dont be cruel 
We got the day and we got the night 
To hold each other really tight 
Whether you lie or sit or walk 
Gonna let my body talk 

Oh Dont talk dirty to me baby 
Just touch me 
Oh You gotta touch me baby 
Dont talk dirty 

Ooh give me some action 
I need your satisfaction 


Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
