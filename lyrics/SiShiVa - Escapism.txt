I look out the window and I wonder at it all
Starin' at the symbols that decorate the wall
And everybody's callin' to come and join them all
And I can't go with no one 'til I understand the call

Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I want

My electronic shaver won't plug into the wall
Now I can't go to the party the electrician didn't call
And I hear they're counting numbers in a store down in Whitehall
So much information, what can they do with it all?

Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I want

I want some demystification
I want some demystification
I want some demystification
And I know what's going on

Some they can talk of Shiva and some they talk of God
Some talk of politicians and some may talk of love
Demystify the heroes with the chances we could take
I'm not looking for escapism, I just wanna escape

Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I want

I want some demystification
I want some demystification
I want some demystification
And I know what's going on

Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I...
Don't come 'round for me unless you got what I want

I want some demystification
I want some demystification
I want some demystification
And I know what's going on

I want some demystification
I want some demystification
I want some demystification
And I know what's going on
