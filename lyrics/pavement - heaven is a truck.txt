heaven is a truck
it got stuck
on the breeze
asked the driver nicely, 
i need a lift?
i need release.
the sand in the boats,
on the rose-covered floats

she is the queen of a canceled Pasadena thrill
(california)

i know arks can't fly 
i know the sharks, they don't have wings
but lady you need some cold advice
about a few things
loosen my dress
tie me up just like all the rest

she is the queen of a canceled Pasadena, thrill
(california)
[repeats]

[although they may say 'castle' a time or two]
