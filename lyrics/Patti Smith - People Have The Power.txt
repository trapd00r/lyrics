I was dreamin' in my dreamin'
Of an aspect bright and fair
And my sleepin' it was broken
But my dream it lingered near

In the form of shinin' valleys
Where the pure air recognized
Oh, and my senses newly opened
And I awakened to the cry

That the people have the power
To redeem the work of fools
From the meek the graces shower
It's decreed the people rule

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

Vengeful aspects became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
But the armies ceased advancing
Because the people had their ear

And when the shepherds and the soldiers
When they lay among the stars
Exchanging visions and laying arms
To waste in the dust

In the form of shining valleys
Where the pure air recognized
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power

Where there were deserts I saw fountains
Like cream the waters rise
And we strolled there together
With none to laugh or criticize

And the leopard and the lamb
They lay together truly bound
I was hoping in my hoping
To recall what I had found

I was dreaming in my dreaming
God knows a purer view
As I lay down into my sleeping
I commit my dream to you

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
The power to dream
To rule, to wrestle the world from fools
It's decreed the people rule
It's decreed the people rule
Listen:
I believe everything we dream
Can come to pass through our union
Oh, we can turn the world around
We can turn the earth's revolution
We have the power

People have the power
People have the power
People have the power
The power to dream
To rule, to wrestle the world from fools
It's decreed the people rule
It's decreed the people rule

We have the power
We have the power
Yes, people have the power
We have the power
