You self-destructive little girl
Pick yourself up, don't blame the world
So you screwed up, but you're gonna be ok

Now call your boyfriend and apologize
You pushed him pretty far away last night
He really loves you, you just don't always love yourself.

And all this time
Ohohoho all this time
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)
All this time
Ohohoho all this time
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)

Think all the mean girls that pulled your hair
Are barefoot now and pregnant there
And you write pop songs and went to travel round the world

And all this time
Ohohoho all this time
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)
And All this time
Ohohoho all this time
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)

So you've had some detours, some stupid men
Now we know what not to do again
Besides, you lucked out, finally

And all this time (all this time)
Ohohoho all this time (all this time)
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)
All this time (all this time)
Ohohoho all this time (all this time)
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)

All this time
Ohohoho all this time
You've had it in you
Just sometimes need a push (La, la, la, la, la)

(All this time, all this time... La, la, la, la, la)
