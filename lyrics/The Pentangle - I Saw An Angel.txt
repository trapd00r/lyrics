I was standing by my window,
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to take my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

~~~♫♫♫ ~~~

Well, I told that undertaker
Please, undertaker , won'tl you please drive slow
'Cos this lady you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I will follow close behind her
Try to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Oh, yes, In the sky, Lord, in the sky
