You can doubt anything
If you think about it long enough
'Cause what happened always adjusts to fit
What happened after that
And it's hard to feel like you are free
When all you seem to do is referee
Remember when it was just you and me
Steppin' up to bat?

And win or lose
Just that you choose this little war
Is what kills you
And either/or it's that this war
Is maybe also what thrills you

We thought we left possession behind
But truth is I was yours and you were mine
And now I've replayed a thousand times
Exactly what was said
'Cause nothing is as it appears
In the funhouse mirrors of your fears
On the roller coaster of all these years
With your hands above your head

And win or lose
Just that you choose this little war
Is what kills you
And either/or it's that this war
Is maybe also what thrills you

I don't care how fast you run
Just tell me, baby, that when you're done
With your little marathon
You still got cab fare home
'Cause the finish line is a shifty thing
And what is life but reckoning
And, you know
You are still the song I sing
To myself
When I'm alone

And win or lose just that we choose
This little war is what kills us
And either/or it's that this war
Is maybe also what thrills us
