I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that
We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery
We don't want to hate and despise one another
In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned men's souls
Sinatra
'Sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'Is this what you want?'
Logic
'You are watching a master at work'
'You have interfered with our affairs for the last time'
Many men wish to acquire fame for the wrong reasons
Fans telling me never change, but it's harder fighting seasons
They hear me on the radio and now they yelling 'Treason!'
Cause Logic giving them mainstreams like Ephesians
But, I never sacrificed my lyrics or my flow
There's a time and place for everything so what the fuck you yelling for?
The fame hit me quicker than previously determined
Rat Pack, real all the time, fuck a vermin
Motivated by money, sex, drugs and violence
Cause the era that we living, it was built up on defiance
What we need is alliance, but y'all don't really hear me though
So, hip-hop's a chariot and Logic's finna carry it
Stallion, coming for their necks like a medallion
Straight out of Sierra Leone

Motherfuckers it's on, I'm under your skin like cortisone
99% of these motherfuckers is bullshit
But I'm on that Bull shit, Michael Jordan
Cutting records after the show at my hotel while I'm touring
Yeah, and I ain't even 23
But my bank account can vouch, I'm balling like an MVP
Yes it's me, L-O-G-I-C,
I'm repping MD
Now what the fuck is a vacation? I see no satisfaction
I work 12 hours a day, every day with no distraction
7 days a week and 12 hours, that's a lazy day
Going 74 hours with no sleep, call that a crazy day
This is Manhunt, and I ain't stopping till y'all apprehended
Many years I have attended and finally been commended
For keeping it real so finger fuck whoever I've offended
Now, pull out the Mac and watch them freeze like PCs
I'm Celsius, never graduated so fuck degrees
I educate 'em with ease, however listener please
Don't knock that last line, school it just wasn't for me
We all different,
And I'm here to make a killing
So say hello to the villain cause in this day that we living
And the nice guys finish last
I'm blowing up
Guess you could say I'm having a blast
'Sinatra shot ya', god damn you'
'You are watching a master at work'
'Is this what you want?'
