Keeping it live
Back to the soul
Vibration-n-n-n

Bringing the vibe
Back in the fold
Vibration-n-n-n

I'm changing my mood
Changing my groove
Changing my views
Because I'm on that new
Vibration-n-n-n

Resetting the mood for you
The new and improved a move
Well overdue it's true
Then when they hear that new type of a bump
They want a snare and a thump
They got a smell of the funk
That's how we waken them up
Now we mopping the scene clean
My team is supreme
I'm rolling in green green
You know what I mean

I'm bringing the (sunshine)
Wherever I go. go, you know the m.o bro
We never lay low, no, no, no
We on a mission to give 'em a little vision to listen
To what I'm spitting there's really no competition
I'm hittin' 'em with the gift and the gab and the slow clap
We takin' 'em back to vibe, the original format

Keeping it live
Back to the soul
Vibration-n-n-n
Bringing the vibe
Back in the fold
Vibration-n-n-n

I'm changing my mood
Changing my groove
Changing my views
Because I'm on that new
Vibration-n-n-n

Fuck what you heard
Fuck what you read
On my leg or arm and leg
I'm moving ahead
Came with the anecdote
Got the hope for the dead
Stay woke, what the fuck do I need with the bed
Stay slicing the loaf, yeah we breaking the bread
Get paid in gold, not paid in lead
If we're paid to approach, I am not a celeb
I speak in quotes so you repeat what I said
I hope you writing this down and recording this sound
Listen up, gather round
I'm about to announce a new update
We gon' dominate spread the fan base
Rampage, kill a whole scene
Someone bring me yellow tape
You eat the yellowtail, I'mma eat the plant-based
I ain't chewing on no food, with two eyes and a face
Got a new attitude, gotta stay elevated
If somebody hate, let them hate and kinda motivate, yeah
Mot...

Got a whole new vibe
Got a whole new vibe

Changed the rules
