Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
So warm
Sounds go through muscles
These abstract wordless movements
They start off cells that haven't been touched before
These cells are virgins
Waking up slowly

My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep

Nothing will be the same
I'm fast asleep
I like this resonance
It elevates me
I don't recognize myself
This is very interesting

My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep

I'm fast asleep now
I'm fast asleep

My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep
