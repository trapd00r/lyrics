So beautiful, So beautiful

I'd give my flesh for yours
I'd sacrifice everything
You are my door to a new beginning
A lucky charm, potato pie
So sweet you make me cry
I can't deny
The way you make me feel inside

You are a beautiful one
And I long to hold
You until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Have mercy on me
I'm crazy 'bout you
Looking all ethereal
Lips make me through
You are my song when there's no music to play
Oh I wanna marry someone like you someday

You are a beautiful one
And I long to hold
You until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Oh beautiful one... Don't you ever go, don't you ever go

Can't you hear the bell's ringing
Doves flying in the air
With this ring I promise to always be right there
Through the good and the bad times
Forever yours, I will remain
With your love baby and my life
You know we can stop the rain, yeah

You are a beautiful one
And I long to hold
You until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Oh beautiful one...
Don't you ever go, don't you go...

You are a beautiful one
And I long to hold
You until the sun
Goes down on your soul

Oh beautiful one
Don't you ever go, don't you ever go...
