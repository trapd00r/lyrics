I couldn't fix my heart 'cause everything was hurting
But I've been growing stronger since you came along
I know that life is precious, gotta make the most of it
Making every second count of every day

You are the food for my soul
The tears in my heart

You are the reason I live
You are the reason that I forgive
The only reason I live
The only reason that I forgive

I always lived my life like some kind of fairytale
'Til you gave it meaning, put my feet on the ground

You are the food for my soul
The tears in my heart

You are the reason I live
You are the reason that I forgive
The only reason I live
The only reason that I forgive

'Cause you give a little love
When I'm all out of it
Never get enough
I scream and shout for it
Give a little love
I'm all over it
Never get enough
I scream and shout for your love
(Shout for your love)
(Shout for your love)
(Shout for the reason that I forgive)

Give a little love
I'm all out of it
Never get enough
Scream and shout for it
Give a little love
I'm all over it
Never get enough
Scream and shout for it

You are the reason I live
You are the reason that I forgive
The only reason I live
The only reason that I forgive

'Cause you give a little love
I'm all out of it
Never get enough
I scream and shout for it
Give a little love
I'm all over it
Never get enough
I scream and shout for your love
