I'm in love, I'm in love and always will be

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you, I'll tell you that
But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
Return to where we were

I know I left too much mess
And destruction to come back
I understand if you can't talk
I'm sure that that makes sense

But I will go down with this ship
There will be no white flag above my door
But I will go down with this ship

I'm in love, I'm in love and always will be
I'm in love, I'm in love and always will be

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love and always will be
