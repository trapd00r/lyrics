Drive by
I saw you driving by
Oh
I thought I'd never see a man
Who can look just like you can
You're an angel
And I blinked cause in the heat
I just thought "C'est pas possible"
You're an angel
Drive my
Drive my lazy eyes
Home

Baby if you let me be
The birthday to you party
I'll say don't ever leave me
Be the always to my maybe

Drive north
I saw you across the floor
Mmm
Gimme a little bit of lovin
Wanna see you in the morning
Be my angel
I'll be turning twenty-two
In a day so why don't you
Come an enjoy

Drive
Drive
Drive
Drive

I see you everywhere I go
It's time for you to know
You're an angel
I wanna lay down in the heat
In the garden of our sleep
My angel
Oh oh
You know I've had an eye on you
Know I've had an eye on you
For years

(Drive)
Baby if you let me be
The birthday to you party
I'll say don't ever leave me
Be the always to my maybe
(Drive)
Baby if you let me be
The birthday to you party
(Drive)
I'll say don't ever leave me
Be the always (to my maybe)
Be the always
(Drive)
Baby if you let me be
