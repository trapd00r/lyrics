if there's a troubador washing
it is he
if there's a man about town
it is he
it there's one to be sought
it is he
if there are nine she's
they are bought for me
this way is as is she
and he placed her unclothed longlegged
on top of the family tree
and if he has chosen the point while she is under him
then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
for it is i
with her on knee
i leave her without pith or feel
and leave her be
leave it be for he controls what there'll be
he makes his face known to none
for if he is seen then all will
and all will know
know me
