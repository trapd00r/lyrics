It's a long time since I saw you last
So tell me how you've been
Did you ever get to buy that yellow coat?
Do the flowers in you window box
Still smile when you walk in?
Did you read the letters that I wrote?
And I've been on the road since Christmas
But it don't seem so long
Outside of that there isn't much to say.
I cut down on my drinkin' some
And wrote another song
I wish you wouldn't look at me that way
Remember all the mornings
We'd walk around the park
The nights we babysat for Billy's kids
And all the times we used to talk
Of having one ourselves
I don't remember why we never did
Do the neighbors still complain a bit
When the music gets too loud?
Does your old cat still sleep up on the bed?
And do you still walk around
With your head up in the clouds?
Have you heard a single thing I've said?
It's a two day drive to New York
Guess I'd better go
Have you noticed the weather's gettin' cold?
And it's a long time since I saw you last
Tell me how you've been
Did you ever get to buy that yellow coat?
Did you ever get to buy that yellow coat?
