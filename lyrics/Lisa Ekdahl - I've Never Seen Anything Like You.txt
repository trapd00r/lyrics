I've seen a million works of art
But nothing on canvas
Can capture my heart
I'm looking for something
Even Rembrandt couldn't do
I've never seen anything like you

I have a million photographs
Of sages and saints
But thre's something they lack
Now I see something
Even God would approuve
I've never seen anything like you

Now you could say my mind is gone
But I know it isn't true
Now I could carry on and on all day
In praise of you

I've seen the stars up in the sky
Like angels from heaven
Or a tear in my eye
But they don't shine brighter
Than the light you're shinin' through
I've never seen anything like you
