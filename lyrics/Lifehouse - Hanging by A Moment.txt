Desperate for changing 
Starving for truth 
Closer where i Started 
Chasing after you 

i'm falling even more in love with you 
letting go of all i've held onto 
i'm standing here until you make me move 
i'm hanging by a moment here with you 

forgetting all i'm lacking 
completely incomplete
i'll take your invitation 
you take all of me 

now.. i'm falling even more in love with you 
letting go of all i've held onto 
i'm standing here until you make me move 
i'm hanging by a moment here with you 

i'm living for the only thing i know
i'm running and not quite sure where to go
i don't know what i'm diving into
just hanging by a moment here with you

there's nothing else to lose
nothing left to find
there's nothing in the world
that could change my mind
there is nothing else
there is nothing else...

Desperate for changing 
Starving for truth 
Closer where i Started 
Chasing after you 

i'm falling even more in love with you 
letting go of all i've held onto 
i'm standing here until you make me move 
i'm hanging by a moment here with you 

i'm living for the only thing i know
i'm running and not quite sure where to go
i don't know what i'm diving into
just hanging by a moment here with you

just hanging by a moment 
hanging by a moment.. 
hanging by a moment... 
hanging by a moment here with you..
