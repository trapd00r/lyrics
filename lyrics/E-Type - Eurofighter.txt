I will sure survive the night
There was a sleep when I come alive
I'll make it run towards the city light
It always keeps me on the right side

I will sure survive the night
There was a sleep when I come alive
I'll make it run towards the city light
It always keeps me on the right side

When we come alive
We never stop we won't give in
When we come alive
We keep it up until we win

The time is now
We won't back down
When we stand united we can save the day
Eurofighter
It's now
We're back in town


We can do whatever, dance the night away

Deep inside made up my mind
I won't back down cause stopped at me now
I'm on the road, this is me you know
And I'm sure I'll get there somehow

When we come alive
We never stop we won't give in
When we come alive
We keep it up until we win

Eurofighter

We can all the save the night
When we come alive
United we stand
