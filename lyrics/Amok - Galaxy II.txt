A census taker once tried to test me
I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti

My downfall, I'm tripping to the edge,
Push me in the back and I'll be slipping right over reality
Skipping on the tail, push me in the back
And you'll be threading on the cross of the eye

Your silence screaming because to me, but I'm too blind to see
Then I step into a dream, and finally your eyes fade to black and I see

The starlight within, shining a light over my galaxy
Colors bring to life, sending me into serenity
Starlight within, the guide of the night with a sense of divinity
Have the devil in me, ceases to be
Your eyes fade to black and I see

Come nightfall, the beast again awakes
Crawling deep inside and I begin to feel a change
And you're not for me, stirring up a rage
Push me in the back and I'll be slipping right outta this cage

The chance to scream, the chance to feed, the demon inside of me
Then I step into a dream, and finally your eyes fade to black and I see

The starlight within, shining a light over my galaxy
Colors bring to life, sending me into serenity
Starlight within, the rule of the night with a sense of divinity
Have the devil in me, ceases to be
Your eyes fade to black and I see
