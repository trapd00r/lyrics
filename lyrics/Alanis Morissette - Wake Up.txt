You like snow but only if it's warm
You like rain but only if it's dry
No sentimental value to the rose that fell on your floor
No fundamental excuse for the granted I'm taken for 

'Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to 
And what goes around never comes around to you
To You

You like pain but only if it doesn't hurt too much
And you sit and you wait to receive
There's an obvious attraction to the path of least resistance 
In your life
There's an obvious aversion no amount of my insistance
Could make you try tonight 

'Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to 
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you, to you, to you, to you, to you 

There's no love, no money, no thrill anymore 

There's an apprehnsive naked little trembling boy
With his head in his hands
There's an underestimated and impatient little girl 
Raising her hand 

But it's easy not to
So much easier not to 
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you, to you 

Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get out, get out of here, enough already
Get up, get up, get up off of it
And wake up
