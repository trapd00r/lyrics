The Syndicate of Sound is playing
At the Free Frank Frenzy
Me and Mitchell
Drinking ourselves into gin oblivion
Hold onto this, hold onto that (?)
Man I don't just wear a hat (?)

Cause it's positively Bodies parking lot
I'm going back there, I can't stop

Got a bottle of beer out of the back out my car
One of each of these girls (?) going in the back door
Yeah we're outside the world famous (???) bar
Crazed couples are pumping away behind the Dipsty (?) dumpster of love
Lorna Doone queen of the ladies room got herself a new bridegroom
He's behind the rubble (?) there in the bathroom
With a thousand tiny pleasure spikes
His buddy's puking in the sink for the third time that night
Go for a killing, bullethead, taking pictures with the infrared

Chorus

The regulars are glued to their barstools
And Jose Sinatra, he's starting to drool
But his feet are getting mighty small, and I'm standing there in the
Hall
Tomcats singing wild and true, blasting out them super blues
It's a Friday night in the summertime, I'm going out of my mind
Harvey's teeth are scaring me, go down to the ditch to take a pee
Crickets are singing a Beat Farmers song I can smell Alberto's mighty
Strong
Jack bent his wife just back over the fire hydrant
The water's shooting high in the sky
And the Silver Eagle motorcycles are drowning there, don't you know

Chorus

Harmonica solo

Country Dick and the Snugglebunnies got me in an airplane spin
I'm thinking about gin, sin, and these three ex-girlfriends
They done showed up to squoosh my head, but I was saved by this guy they
Call
Well they call him Mojo's dad cause he's a screaming lunatic
Librarian from El Cahone (?) checking out my love bone
Redhead says that she wants me to dance
Rock Jet's (?) got everybody in a trance
Peak expectations calls it intoxications
I can smell the mating dance of them fornication

Be young, be foolish
Be happy, blasting out of the jukebox

Two a.m., lights are on, nobody can stop, nobody's going home
Can't leave, can't go anywhere, cause you know you're already there

Cause it's positively Bodies parking lot
Positively Bodies parking lot
Positively Bodies parking lot
It's positively Bodies parking lot
Yes it's positively Bodies parking lot
