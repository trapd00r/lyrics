(Verse 1: 2Pac)
I started out dumb, sprung off o' 'hood rats
Listening to the radio, wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me, man
Listen: I've got a scheme, break away, do my own thing
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings and don't stress in this land with no love
Maybe they see me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I guess that's why they're envious and get their eyes swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, "Have a heart" - fuck they're feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started
We cold hearted niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers
Niggas talk a lot of non-shit I choose to ignore
A war? They ain't ready for it

Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Tell me now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)

(Verse 2: Young Noble and Kastro)
My nine is Thuglord, my mind on my grind
Outlawz is my heart, they shine when I shine

My ryhme is my grind, my team be on role
Proceed with the onslaught, indeed they all talk
They all marks and it's an Outlaw holocaust

When I got the sawed-off

Niggas gettin' hauled off

Yeah, nigga beware, stand clear

This nigga's scared

Man, I don't really care
I've been lost love (love)
My heart need a hug (hug)
My bite need blood (blood)
I fight with a grudge

The life of a thug nigga might need gloves
But you'll never know with a price on your mug
Them fight strips snug right around your hands
Make it sure you can never grab the mic again
Dog, you fucking with a grown man

And I can't afford to lose
Where we from niggas torture dudes
So whatcha wann' do?

Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Tell me now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Tell me now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)

(Verse 3: 2Pac)
Watch me clown, give me lovin' when I'm high
I'm an outlaw baby, I'll be thuggin' till I die
In my drop-top double-R, life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend till they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watch them niggas out the sight of my night scope
Cooking white dope got my nigga 25-to-life stretched out
Trying to have all the better things in life
Well Makaveli - a born leader; 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heed, from out the bible I read:
See the meek shall inherit the Earth
And the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's all right
I'm in the studio makin' music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated till the death
Trying to beat me out my last breath
Whatcha gonna do?

Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do
When my niggas come for you
(Whatcha'll gonna do?)
