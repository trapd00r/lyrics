Uh-huh, Yeah

the reason u have the courage to confront your fears
the reason theres 2 carrots in each your ears
I splurge with the paper ma, i don't care

Come on Finest champaign we can toast to life
craps table in Vegas u can toss the dice
Don't let your friends get ya confused sayin' 50 bad news

[Jennifer Lopez] 
it's funny 'cause for a while
walked around with a smile but
deep inside i could hear 
voices telling me this ain't right
don't u know its not for you
i always knew what i had to do
but its hard to get away
because i love you i just tried to stay

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oow yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside i'm gonna be alright (I'm gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (yes I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Friends of mine say to me
They say you got control over me
you're not alone, I played my part
i saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside i'm gonna be alright (I'm gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (yes I have baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (ow yeah)
though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Said I wouldn't walk away
Somedays I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true
Me livin' without you
But now it's time for me to make a move

[50 Cent]
Now when I tell ya what my wishes are
u don't respect it
when i smile at ya
u don't smile back like we're connected
u ain't been goon long but
i already miss ya
i need you next to me so i can hug u and kiss u
all the talkin on the phone
all the time we shared
how could u fix your mouth to say i don't care
i had plans 4 us
to buy ice together, engagement rings, and things and sharelife
together
now when your friends tell ya 50 called you like whatever
do u think we were wrong for each other from the start
or was it my actions that made us grow apart
just want u to know you always have a place in my heart

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (but I did baby)

After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (wasn't wit it)

After telling everybody that I wasn't with it

And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
