Dr. Dre
Check check
One, two
One, two
One, two (is it rolling?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dr. Dre up in here
Y'all know what this is
It's what y'all been waiting for
Funk Master Flex
Big Kap
Def Jam Records giving it to you, baby
Yo, Eminem
Show these motherfuckers what time it is, baby

Eminem
I used to be a lonely man (only mad)
Until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair
I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest
Before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again
It was an accident
I had my back against a fan
Who chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket, it ain't latching
They can't lock it
So they stapled my hand
To my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered
Like someone else had it before me
And just kept throwing them-fucking-selves at it
My head is aching
I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? (come on)
Anyway, I got down with Dre (what up?)
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the police"
When you still had your mother's fucking nipple
Stuck in your teeth (fucking baby)
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler, "Bravo"
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face, but I won't
'Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it
With your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough
You just get drunk and become talkative (wanna fight?)
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block
Stumbling, mumbling a bunch of dumb shit
Like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs
When I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers

I'm drunk pass the test

(Chorus) (repeat 2X)

Eminem
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Dr. Dre
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on
Eminem
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Dr. Dre
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (ah)
Psych I'm just joking, for Christ sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailey Jade
Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter
Fuck you, lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes (fuck it)
The neighborhood that I grew up in
You could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me
So try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what
I can and what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the
Age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it
I'm tired, bitch
I'm dying to quit
Hip hop is universal now
It's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it
So they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic, it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder
I committed since three years old

Eminem
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Dr. Dre
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on

Dr. Dre
Yo, fuck that
Turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do
