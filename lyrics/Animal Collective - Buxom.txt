She said don't hurry to somewhere
I just kept looking for
This power now
Just living without you

Oh buxom, you're stratus high
You've not been taking it easy, baby
Your passion is so, so fine
Won't you crawl with me, lady?

And she looked at the door
That I paused for
And time was passing by
So quickly, you decide that

Oh buxom, you're stratus high
You've not been taking it easy, baby
Your passion is so, so fine
Won't you crawl with me, lady?

Aren't you a little doll?
You say that I don't know what that means but
And times moves by
So still we allow her

I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
Oh yes
