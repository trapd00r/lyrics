When you first left me, I was wanting more 
But you were fucking that girl next door
What ya do that for? (What ya do that for?)
When you first left me, I didn't know what to say 
I've never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then 
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
It's only because you're feeling alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me you say that you want me back (Want be back)
And I tell you it don't mean jack (It don't mean jack)
No, it don't mean jack (No, it don't mean jack)
I couldn't stop laughing, no, I just couldn't help myself
See you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
It's only because you're feeling alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile I go ahead and smile

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la laa

At first, when I see you cry (When I see you cry)
Yeah, it makes me smile (It makes me smile)
Yeah, it makes me smile (Yeah, it makes me smile)
At worst, I feel bad for a while (I feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile (Then I just smile)
I go ahead and smile (I go ahead and smile)

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la laa

At first, when I see you cry (When I see you cry)
Yeah, it makes me smile (It makes me smile)
Yeah, it makes me smile (Yeah, it makes me smile)
At worst, I feel bad for a while (I feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile (Then I just smile)
I go ahead and smile (I go ahead and smile)
