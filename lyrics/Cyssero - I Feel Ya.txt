I feel your eyes upon me
I feel your arms sorround me
I feel your lips around me
Baby baby let's get down
I feel your body on me
I feel your kisses touch me
I feel the love you give me
Baby baby let's get down

Oh baby baby
I feel you get ready
Oh baby baby
You feel so good it's delay
I feel you can you feel me baby

I feel your eyes upon me
I feel your arms sorround me
I feel your lips around me
Baby baby let's get down
I feel your body on me
I feel your kisses touch me

I feel the love you give me
Baby baby let's get down

Oh baby baby
I feel you coming closer
(Oh baby it's almost over)
Oh baby baby
You feel so good it's delay

I feel your eyes upon me
I feel your arms sorround me
I feel your lips around me
Baby baby let's get down
I feel your body on me
I feel your kisses touch me
I feel the love you give me
Baby baby let's get down
