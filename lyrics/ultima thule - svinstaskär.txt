Hey there little red riding hood You sure are lookin' good.
You're everything that a Big Bad Wolf could want (listen to me!)

Little red riding hood I don't think little big girls should.
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods Alone. (Aooooooooo)

What big eyes you have. The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad.
So until you get to Grandma's place I think you ought to walk with me and be safe.

I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on. Until I'm sure that you've been shown. 
That I can be trusted walkin with you alone. (Aoooooooooooooo)

What pure lips you have. They're sure to lure someone bad.. 
Little red riding hood Even bad wolves can be good.

I'll try to be satisfied Just to walk close by your side.. 
Maybe you'll see things my way Before we get to Grandma's place

Little red riding hood You sure are lookin' good
You're everything that a Big Bad Wolf would want
