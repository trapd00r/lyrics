Fire fly landed on a slender weed
I saw her flash and said, Yes, indeed,
That little light is the only light I know

Winged girl dancer sing her notes
Said to myself that's all she wrote
That's just one breeze I've got to let it blow

Hold out walk in the burrowed pit
He laid right down and said this it
I've gone as far as far as I could go

He died right there he died then
When he did he began again
He got back up and headed down the road

It seems there's just one story
It seems there just one song
Passed around eternity
That ain't long

Tortoise laughed as he passed the hare
He smiled and said I'm getting there
But can't get through there by just by standing back

When ur there ur never here
And here is where it seems so clear
The winner of the rat race are the rats

Runnin' races in my head
Whos leading who, who is being led
Who is burning, who's waiting to combust

I realize it's all just fine
'Cause in the end with a little time
We all turn into the stars and other dust

You've got yours and you want mine
Take that space and stand in line
Defines what's yours as anybody chooses

We claim to know what we're fighting for
But it's always just the same old war
Somebody wins and everybody loses

The raven and the eagle met
What they both said I will not forget
But how they said it, I will long remember

I recall the fire they lit
The roaring leaping flame that lit
There's just one fire now till its dying ember
