I'm going to fuck your life up
I'm going to crush your soul
Two demons stand beside me
And now i'm takin' control

I never sleep
I got a sinister plan
Your world is weak
And i'm overtakin' command

Because i am the warlock
I am the warlock

I'm going to fuck your mind up
And you'll be writhing in pain
Stare deep into my scepter
Now you're goin' insane

You try to run and hide
I'm gonna slice you in half
You try to gather up your army
Now you're making me laugh

I whisper the ancient scriptures
I drink the blood of the lamb
And as i begin to levitate
This is the day of the damned

I am the warlock
I am the warlock
