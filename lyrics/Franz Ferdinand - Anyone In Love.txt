Above the fold of covers
Ten thousand volts hit
Where her arm fell accidentally
But she didn't move it
Despite the singing skin
You didn't move yours either did you though?

Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were

What other people call passion
Is one frame of your film
One frame seen accidentally
How could a love like this one
Remain among us
It was a love that had to
Had to leave

Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were

Don't be surprised if there's a book about it
Based roughly on a film about it
Something on your TV about it
And, then, now, a song about it
Alright

Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were

Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were
Never knew anyone in love
The way that you were

Never knew anyone
Never knew anyone
Never knew anyone
Never knew anyone
Never knew anyone
In love
