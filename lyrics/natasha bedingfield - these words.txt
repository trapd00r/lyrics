These words are my own

Threw some chords together, the combination D-E-F
Its who I am, its what I do, and I was gonna lay it down for you
I tried to focus my attention, but I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration, but its not coming easily

(bridge)
Tryin to find the magic,
Tryin to write a classic,
Dontcha know, dontcha know, dontcha know?
Wastebin full of paper, 
clever rhymes- see ya later

(chorus)
These words are my own, from my heart flow,
I love you, i love you, i love you, i love you,
There's no other way to better say 
I love you, i love you

Read some Byron, Shelley and Keates, 
recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm havin trouble sayin what i mean, 
with dead poets and a drum machine

You know i had some studio time booked,
but i couldnt find the killer hook,
now you're gonna raise the bar right up,
nothin i write is ever good enough

(repeat chorus twice)

I'm gettin off my stage
the curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes
woaaaaah

(repeat bridge)
(repeat chorus 
I love you I love you, thats all i got to say
cant think of a better way, and thats all i got to say
I love you, is that ok?
