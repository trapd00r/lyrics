[Verse 1]
You look all the same
Bringing on the night home
Breakin' underworld
Want to get in under
You look all the same
Bringing on the night home
Breakin' underworld
Want to get in under

[Chorus]
You look all the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight
All the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight

[Verse 2]
You look all the same
Bringing on the night home
Don't wanna be alone
No one will look the same
But you, you

[Chorus]
You look all the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight
All the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight
You look all the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight
All the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight
You look all the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight
All the same tonight
(You look all the same)
You look all the same, (same) same tonight
