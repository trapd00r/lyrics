When I’m walking alone in the night I see the green coyote in the distance
Strolling in the desert long beneath the crescent moon
In the boomerang action of the noon gang I climb the hills and I wonder
Thunder and the lightning falls into a barren zone

Maybe someone saw me in the forest last Wednesday night, I don’t know.
I visit all the time but then again I try to not to be seen, in the green.
‘Cause I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night.
I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night.

I look at the bones, purplish tones, across the valley painted by the sage brush
Driest open prairie waiting for the fallen stars.
On a rock edge hanging off a steep ledge I climb on down into an oak tree
Rolling in it’s twisted limbs I float above the ground

Running from a rolling angry tumbleweed down a hill, in the wind
Sliding on the gravelly traveling avalanches on the slope, in the plain
‘Cause I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night.
I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night.

On the high ground, shaken by a low sound, the desert looming in the distance
Looking at the sunlight dying through the blackened ridge
Water out of nowhere, flying through the air, I see the tidal wave and I’m under
Holding in my breath I sink into the desert sea

Swimming through the turning and churning into the afternoon sun, up above
Floating river canyon abandoned by sand and heat and all the rocks, on the plain

‘Cause I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night
I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night.
I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night.
I’m a mountain jumper, when I ride the night….
