(Feat. Life, Roots Manuva, Si-Phillie, Skeleton)

(Roots manuva)

Pen to tha paper I scream at the world
Picky headed youth don't wear no jerry curl
In the heat of the summer
More time I trembled
Nothin' don't change, I'm picky from within
The R's for the Rage
E's for the Energy
B's for the 3-4 Bounce that we count
Second E's for the Era of this young hottie youth
L presents Long term soildier stand firm
Foundation flexin stretchin out the pound
I used to want the queens head
Now I want the crown
Its in my blood stream
Shits to hard to define
Why, some get the vision an the rest tow the line
Sleepwalkin floggin the horse that's done dead
Pissin in the wind now piss drips down your leg
Is you plum or is you pleb
Dude its one an the same
One shit short now flush that pee brain
Put ur hand on ur lips spell d-e-r
You wanna be, fartface
An me can't spar
Like the, dooper I am I don't wanna cause friction
I hold my space an then I diss 'em wid the diction
Nuff of them will fear this
Its right now that they don't wish to hear this
Simple forensic but they can't get near this
Its fingerprints of god
G-O-D

(Life)

Keep 'em philosophical
My rap styles collasol to your brain
Like a line of cocaine straight up your nostril
Nowadays like aristotle
I send my message through da mic not in a bottle
A gifted mic disciple like an apostle
Hip hops my life an hustle
Lyric skils be the muscle
They be brand new like the heavies not old like some fossils
I meditate on bible scriptures
Not porno pictures
I smoke sensi bud, green like the trees of eucalyptus
Buffalo soldier from a rasta man army
I need hip hop to satisfy my soul like bob marley
Wisdoms what I give them
Flippin knowledge on the rhythm
If your talkin' like a devil I'm performin exorcism
Ill cause malice, smoke a chalice in buckingham palace
Get the queen high, send her to wonder land like alice
'Cause I'm a dark stranger
Not from a dirty sick chamber
'Cause a star burns above my head like Jesus from a manger
Lone ranger, I don't need a posse to follow
My backup be my sword I use it swift like zorro
Guided by a force similar to obi one kenobe
Walk the skies like luke an even chewbacca couldn't hold me
If ur a phoney, its lights out like james toni
An I'm confident like naseem hamed, so you don't know me
I walk in the shadows, I make you paro (paranoid)
My mind be narrow, I carry guns an laser bow an arrows

(Si-phillie)

I be the bingee man come back from zion
Wid the bag of sensimilila an da mic in da other hand
Bounty killa on the rampage for reala
Gonna make mad dough like my name was don miller
Chancellor exchequer mic recka
[?] Or sampras
You know I be top class
This one is a message from king salisse i
Any pussy bwoy tess I dem bwoy gaan die
Puppet master rasta bring forth disaster
Eskimos be boppin to my shit in Alaska
Weak emcees be droppin' out 'cause they have ta
Convert niggas I make 'em go see their pastor
Power move makin'
Never fakin that jamaican
I'm from trinidad
When it comes to respect, I'm like ur dad
Not a fake like alexander o neil
Neva choppin off my locks like that nigga seal
The si philly hot tabasco chilli
Niggas suckin up my style like a nipple on a titty
I'm flippin lyrics when I'm not on the rob
So my surgical gloves protects the prints of the gods

(Skeleton)

God all mighty what the devil (u star ?)
Wot the hell what on earth cha
What the bloodclaat
Wat da rass hole blast hole ina di beast
I'm da blessin an da dammend an da famine an the feast
I'm a man 'o' war 'cause I was a man of peace
Now I'm out for your neighbours like they name was annalise
Speak from a snow capped peak to the abyss
I'm ugly as sin
An I'm da livin' criss
I'm chilled in the field an the inner city hype
I'm the murderin theivin rapin type
I'm the heat, the light, the cold an the dark
I'm the silver back gorilla an the great white shark
I'm the poorest slum I'm the richest palace
The lyricist the herbalist and the gyaliss
I can get ya down an I can get you lifted
The giver an the gifted
The bima ain't fiftied
Shifted, gears I'm the tears an the laughter
The birth an the death an whatever there after
The kiss on the cheek an the kick ina de crotch
The fingerprints of god an every head'll get touch
