We celebrate seven weeks Miker "G" and Sven
We took a holiday with all our friends
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind
Exactly seven weeks or something crossed my mind

It was the shine of the time we never forget
One morning our parents kicked us out of our beds
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool
But the answer was short: "You gotta go to school!"

G's running up and down and everybody know
Rappin', rockin', poppin' in the street-kid-show
Miker "G" rocks the house and you know what I'm saying
Now when he's on the mic there is no delaying

So you better run to see him in your neighbourhood
He's rappin', rockin' all the way to Hollywood
Hey, check it out, these are the words we say
Yo, scream with us: we need a holiday!

We gonna ring-reng-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-reng-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)

We gonna ring-reng-a-dong for a holiday
(Miker "G" and Sven were here to stay)
We gonna ring-reng-a-dong for a holiday
(Hey, check out the new style we just play)

We are going on a summerholiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (Right!)

I wanna holiday, I screamed a lot
Your only thing, school's the only thing I've got
Sven's parents told me I better go
'Cause Sven's hangin' on the street in the street-kid show

In the bar "Rox" what happened to you?
I told him it's my life and I know what I'm doin'
I saw the school I thought I'd never stay
Give me seven weeks again, I need my holiday!

Well, this is my partner with the number one jam
Famous in the Boogie Bronx and Amsterdam
He's the fastest rapper, yo, his name is Miker "G"
His rap is stronger than the sucker MC's

Well, let me show you what my man can do
Rappin', rockin', poppin' and the boogaloo too
But anyway, no more delay
Just listen to the beat-box he will play

My name is MC Sven, I'm also deejay
I didn't like the schools, I too another way
You like the Miker "G" so I used my voice
And soon I bought a big Rolls Royce

That's right, my name is Miker "G"
I use the holiday with the M.I.C.
On the street was a party bigger than Hollywood
I grew up in this world, started in the neighbourhood

We gonna ring-reng-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)

So now it's time to get the weaks
We're dreamin' of, 'cause I get some freaks
Miker "G" and Sven, two fresh MC's
They're ready for the holiday, if you know what I mean

Everybody, have a ball and enjoy yourself
The two party-arty and step on the shelf
The shelfe of the freedom, let me hear you say
Leave your school this time, take a holiday!

Two fresh MC's, Miker "G" and Sven
Well, we got more girls than a school can't stand
Makin' music, rappin', rockin' all night long
So point your ears and listen to this song

There's nothing better than a sunny holiday
Which starts in June and ends in May
We ain't foolin' around, we're no stupid play
The only thing we need is a holiday

We gonna ring-reng-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-reng-a-dong for a holiday
(Hey, check out the new style we just play)

I can see you
But I can't hear you
And you know that

We are going on a summerholiday

We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (Right!)

Bite is the thing most rappers do
But I can write my own thing too
I can understand things most rappers say
'Cause rappin' is my thing and I do it every day

I'm the number one rapper, yo, my name is Sven
I can rap more raps than a superman can
So I'm the guy on your radio
Also rockin' to the rhythm in stere-ereo

And you don't stop that bodyrock
And you won't stop that bodyrock
Yo, spell my name right, I'm Miker "G"
M-I-K-E-R and "G, you see

Yo, "M" is microphone and "G"'s genius
Miker "G" in the house, that's serious
And you know that and you show that
It's time, Sven, so let's go back!
