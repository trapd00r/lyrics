[Hook]
Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

[Verse 1]
Love in technicolor, sprayed out on walls
Well I've been pounding at the pavement
'Til there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger
In a bar room brawl
See the local loves a fighter
Loves a winner to fall

[Pre-Hook]
Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin

[Hook]
Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

[Verse 2]
It don't matter
I won't do what you say
You've got the money and the power
I won't go your way
I can't take for the people
They don't matter at all
And I'll be waiting in the shadows
'Til the day that you fall

[Pre-Hook]
Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time  to begin

[Hook]
Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train

[Outro]
Tell me if you're down
Throw your weapons to the ground
Keep myself right on this train
Paper on the wire
Sold your soul for another one
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train
