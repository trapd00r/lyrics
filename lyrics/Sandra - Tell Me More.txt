Tell me more
Tell me more
Whatever I hear
It will be all right

Tell me more
Tell me more
I wanna believe in you
For all time

Baby you try to find solutions
When there is notning you can do
Baby I'm hidin my confusion
Just when all I need is you

Can't we try to understand each other
I will listen to you now
I will turn you Inside out

Tell me more
Tell me more
Whatever I hear
It will be all right
(I was never ever tryin' to hurt you)

Tell me more
Tell me more
I wanna believe in you
For all time
(I didn't get to tell I love you)

I've got to tell you just one reason
Why we can never be apart
'Cause when I look you in the eye I see it
Feels so good when I'm around
You just have to let it out

Tell me more
Tell me more
Whatever I hear
It will be all right
(I was never ever tryin' to hurt you)

Tell me more
Tell me more
I wanna believe in you
For all time
(I didn't get to tell I love you)
