Remember how we used to be
Floating the skies, it fell so heavenly
We were weightless
We froze to ice and melted down
We chased the stars and fell to the ground
Couldn't care less

This feeling inside
You're all that I have, I need you back
Do you hear me screaming?

Stay amazing lie (do you hear me screaming?)
I don't, don't want another to make me high
I want, want you to be amazing lie
Stay amazing lie

You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'd brake the curse of time to be with you
I'd be fearless
I'd jump as far as I can see
And beat the perfect storm in the endless sea

This feeling inside
You're all that I have, I need you back
Do you hear me screaming?

Stay amazing lie (do you hear me screaming?)
I don't, don't want another to make me high
I want, want you to be amazing lie
Stay amazing lie

This feeling inside
You're all that I have, I need you back
We were weightless

Stay amazing lie (do you hear me screaming?)
I don't, don't want another to make me high
I want, want you to be amazing lie
Stay amazing lie
