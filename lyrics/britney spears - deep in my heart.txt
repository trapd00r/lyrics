Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, I want you for the rest of my life,
oh yeah
Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way
What have I done, I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change

Bridge:
'Cause you've turned my world around
Since you came along, no
After this love was found
It seems like we can't go wrong

Chorus: Deep in my heart I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I'll never let go 'cause I love ya so
Oh-oh, I want you for the rest of my life

Some people search what seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this, oh yeah
And here we are with everything we've wished for
I've never felt such bliss

Repeat Bridge

Repeat Chorus

Oh, yeah
There comes a chance in everyone's life
And I believe it won't happen twice
Now since I felt the glory of love
I wish to spend forever and ever with you

Repeat Chorus
