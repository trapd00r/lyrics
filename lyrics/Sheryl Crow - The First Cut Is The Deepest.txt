I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taken just all that I had
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
And when it comes to loving me he's worst

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you want, I'll try to love again, try
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

Oh, the first cut is the deepest 
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
And when it comes to loving me he's worst

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again 
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

Oh, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
And when it comes to loving me he's worst

Oh, the first cut is the deepest 
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
Try to love again
