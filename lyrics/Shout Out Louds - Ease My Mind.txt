Leave your friends
I wanna see you
Come over

Leave your dreams
I'll give you new ones
Come over

Stay the night
Hear my whistle
Roll over

Kill the light
I wanna feel you
All over

Ease my mind, baby
If everything will disappear
Just tell me what I want to hear

Ease my mind again
Let's stay awake another night
Oh it won't be for nothing

Summer nights
All of these blue ones
I know them

Tell me lies
I'll tell you true ones
I'm sober

In the back seat
You got blue headlights
Pull over

Leave your dreams
I'll give you new ones
Come over

Come over
Come over
Come over

Ease my mind, baby
If everything will disappear
Just tell me what I want to hear

Ease my mind again
Let's stay awake another night
Oh it won't be for nothing

This dedicated to the one I love
This dedicated to the one I love
This dedicated to the one I love
This dedicated to the one I love
This dedicated to the one I love
This dedicated to the one I love
