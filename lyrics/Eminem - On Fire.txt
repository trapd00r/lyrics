Heh, yeah, haha
You know critics man, critics never got nothing nice to say man
You know the one thing I noticed about critics, man
Is critics never asked me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog, try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this, I could blow, fire in the hole

I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flow's tighter, hot headed as ghost rider, cold hearted
As Spider-Man throwin' a spider in the snow

So you better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a low-rider
With no tires in the hole
Why am I like this, why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the ho's

Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off

The Wizard of Oz, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws

So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit

You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire

I just put a bullshit hook
In between two long ass verses, if you mistook this for a song, look
This ain't a song, it's a warnin' to Brooke
Hogan and David Cook, that the crook just took over, so book

Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightnin' in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter
Like hot grease splashin' a fan, Mr. Mathers is the man

Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man

Turn him into plastic, so for you to think that you could stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flying crayon

Fuck it, I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out on a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand

So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop

Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody'll fuckin' test me 'cause these ho's won't even dare

I'm wastin' punch lines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot, it's like you're burning up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so, im so hot
My muthafuckin' fire truck's on fire, homie

You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip-Hop Shop to blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire
