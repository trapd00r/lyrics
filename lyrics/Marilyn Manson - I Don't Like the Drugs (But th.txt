I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

Norm life baby
We're white and oh so hetero
And our sex is missionary
Norm life baby
We're quitters, and we're sober
Our confessions will be televised

You and I are underdosed, and we're ready to fall
Raised to be stupid; taught to be nothing at all
(We're taught to be nothing at all)

I don't like the drugs, but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

Norm life baby
Our god is white and unforgiving
We're piss tested and we're praying
Norm life baby
I'm just a sample of a soul
Made to look just like a human being
Norm life baby
We're rehabbed and we're ready
For our 15 minutes of shame
Norm life baby
We're talkshown and we're pointing
Just like Christians at a suicide

You and I are underdosed, and we're ready to fall
Raised to be stupid; taught to be nothing at all
(We're taught to be nothing at all)

CHORUS

There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine (x3)

CHORUS (x8)
