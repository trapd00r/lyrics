Judex crederis

[FROLLO, spoken]
The prisoner has been found guilty of entering the city of Paris illegally, guilty of stabbing a soldier in the church, and guilty of the crime of witchcraft. The sentence is death! I will give you this opportunity to recant and save yourself. Think of what I’ve offered. What is your answer?

[ESMERALDA spits at FROLLO]

[CHOIR]
Libera me domine

[FROLLO, spoken]
For the justice of the realm and for the salvation of Paris, it is my sacred duty to send this unholy demon back to hell!

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Esmeralda!

[CHOIR]
Libera me domine
De morte aeterna

[CONGREGATION, spoken]
And at that moment, Quasimodo decided—

[CHOIR]
In die illa
Tremenda
Quando caeli
Movendi sunt

[CONGREGATION, spoken]
He could remain stone no longer—

[CHOIR]
Caeli et terra
Dum venere judicare
Saeculum per ignem

Salutaris
Salutaris hostia
Quae caeli pandis ostium
Bella premunto hostilia
Da robur fer auxilium
Sit sempiterna gloria
Sit sempiterna gloria
Sit sempiterna gloria
Gloria, gloria
Semper sanctus

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Sanctuary!

[CHOIR]
Sanctus

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Sanctuary!

[CHOIR]
In excelsis

[FROLLO, spoken]
Captain, seize the cathedral!

[CAPTAIN, spoken]
But sir, the laws of sanctuary!

[FROLLO, spoken]
I am the archdeacon of this cathedral, I negate the laws of sanctuary! Open those doors! Ram them through if you must!

[CONGREGATION, spoken]
As the soldiers attempted to throw open the church doors, they suddenly saw Quasimodo hurl giant stones and wooden beams

[CHOIR]
Dies irae
Dies irae
Dies irae
Dies illa

[FROLLO, spoken]
Use them to break down the doors!

[CHOIR]
Dies irae
Dies illa

[PHOEBUS]
Hear me, people of Paris
How much oppression will you allow

[CHOIR]
Olim deus accelere
Hoc saeculum splendidum

[PHOEBUS]
Someday your patience will finally break
Why not make someday come right now

[CHOIR]
Accelere fiat venire olim

[CONGREGATION, spoken]
The people fought the soldiers but could not hold them back. With one final blow, they knocked down the doors. And Quasimodo, ran back and forth trying to find a way to stop them. Until, he came upon the great vats of molten lead sitting up on the roof

[SOLDIER, spoken]
My God, look up there! He’s way up there!

[QUASIMODO]
Come all you saints of stone
All you guardians and gargoyles
Raise the fire in the night
Raise the fire now and light
These vats of lead
Steaming, boiling streams of lead
Burning lead and let
The flames grow higher
Oh, saints and monster
Show your power
Help me to send this raging shower
Raining fire on the stone below

(spoken)
We’ve done it, Esmeralda! Beaten them back! Esmeralda? You are home

[ESMERALDA, spoken]
Home?

(sung)
Here again at the top of the world
Two friends enjoying this beautiful morning
In my eyes you are beautiful, too
Sharing the top of the world

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Can stay inside here forever

[ESMERALDA, spoken]
I don’t think…forever. You are such a good friend, Quasimodo

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Yes, your friend... Esmeralda? Esmeralda, wake up!

[FROLLO, spoken]
Is she dead?

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Because of you!

[FROLLO, spoken]
It was my duty

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Duty?

[FROLLO, spoken]
Now we can finally go back to the way things were

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
No! Never go back

[FROLLO, spoken]
We will. You’ll see

(sung)
At last we're free of Esmeralda
Now that she's gone
The poison dies with her
Now that we're free of Esmeralda
We can go on
As close as once we were

Here in our sanctuary
Sanctuary

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Sanctuary? No sanctuary without her!

[FROLLO, spoken]
It was her choice, Quasimodo. I could have helped her. Even loved her

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
Love? What do you know of love? Who have you ever loved?

[FROLLO, spoken]
I loved... I loved my brother. I tried to teach him

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
You? Teach him?

[FROLLO, spoken]
Yes, as I've tried to teach you! But he was wicked, weak!

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
No—you are the weak one. You’re the wicked one! And the wicked shall not go unpunished!

[CONGREGATION]
The wicked shall not go unpunished
The heart of the wicked is of little worth
The wicked shall not go unpunished

[CHOIR]
Solvet saeculum in favilla
Teste David cum sybilla
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando judex est venturus

[FROLLO, spoken]
Let go of me, Quasimodo!  Quasimodo!  Let go!

[QUASIMODO, spoken]
I told you, master. I am very strong!

[FROLLO, spoken)
You don’t want to hurt me!

[CONGREGATION, spoken]
Yes, you do
Quasimodo raised his two huge hands and, with a great bellow, threw his master over the edge of the roof into the abyss below

[FROLLO, spoken]
Damnation!

[CONGREGATION]
The world is cruel
The world is ugly
But there are times
And there are people
When the world is not
And at its cruelest
It's still the only world we've got
Light and dark
Foul and fair

[QUASIMODO]
Out there

[CHOIR]
Olim deus accelere
Hoc saeculum splendidum
[CONGREGATION/Chorus]
Someday
Life will be kinder
Love will be blinder
Some new afternoon
Godspeed this bright millennium
Hope lives on
Wish upon the moon
Let it come one day[CHOIR]
Olim deus accelere
Hoc saeculum splendidum

Accelere fiat venire olim
[QUASIMODO]
Someday—

[CONGREGATION/Chorus]
Soon

[CLOPIN]
Morning in Paris
A new day appears
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Ending the tale
Of your poor balladeers
Sing the bells of Notre Dame

[CONGREGATION]
And we wish we could leave you a moral
Like a trinket you hold in your palm
But here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
What makes a monster
And what makes a man
[ALL]
Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells[CLOPIN, QUASIMODO, ESMERALDA, PHOEBUS, FROLLO]
Whatever their pitch you
Can feel them bewitch you
The rich and the ritual knells
Of the
[ALL]
Bells of Notre Dame
