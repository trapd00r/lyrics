[intro]
Yeah 
Gangstas are back 
The sound that stirring the Ghettos 

[verse1]
See our class back the streets 
Don't miss this nigga, not sleep 
50 Cent rhymes for you shit 
Nigga before I shot counting until 3
Start to imagine me in the dance 
I'm the man that you'll not surpass
Singing, command, shots, traffic ... My God 
My mansion in party are at the top 
I'm the Rap' king nigga, this location 
Let this, not working, not for celebration 
Money overflows, the game of fame 
The game of power I gained without pain 
I'm a black, luck and bitches man
You can look and not hits my brain 
I hear the shots from a semi-automatic and an AK 
AR-15, Cocaine, girls and a HK 
I hear everyone talking about "50 is on the way" 
2pac would "you can beat me, being the 1st"
I outweighs thus nigga without dirt
Dr Dre said that I would come to disturb
I'm the guy who you most afraid of 
I shine nigga, 5 and 0 shine more than the sun 
Guns, music, drugs and style make me the number 1

[chorus- 50 Cent (Nate Dogg)]
Will I always is in front (We Gangstas)
I'll lead you, I'll move (We Gangstas)
In my game you lose, yeah lose (We Gangstas)
I know you nigga, you're weak (We Gangstas)
My money long, my life is long (We Gangstas)
If hide hand, listen to this song (We Gangstas)
Just like me, my smile is forever (We Gangstas)
You beat me in my never, yeah never (We Gangstas)

[outro] Yeah sends see 50

[verse2- 50 Cent]
GG GG G-Unit!!!

You're now lost their shit 
Now I get to reality, I'll begin the attack 
The bid is that you have not pact 
My body is moved to bullets, my body is in flames 
You're not in the street, you never got a rains
Stealing, explosions, ended with his face, BANG! 
I'm with heat nigga, weapons and AKs are singing man 
Our power is unimaginable man, that crazy 
Bitches mad, hot bitches want a baby 
That just makes me laugh today, you make me 
I spent on my carousel in hotel, in my car 
I'm New York, I mentioned I'm Rap' star 
Don't make war on me, I'm head of the war 
Don't know what we do, or try to go 
Don't try to man, not try to beat me, impossible

[chorus- 50 Cent (Nate Dogg)]
Will I always is in front (We Gangstas)
I'll lead you, I'll move (We Gangstas)
In my game you lose, yeah lose (We Gangstas)
I know you nigga, you're weak (We Gangstas)
My money long, my life is long (We Gangstas)
If hide hand, listen to this song (We Gangstas)
Just like me, my smile is forever (We Gangstas)
You beat me in my never, yeah never (We Gangstas)

[outro] Yeah now 50

[verse3]
Beginning this verse sending you shut your mouth
I send away with the eiffel tower with war tank 
Put a freedom statue and must not steal the bank
I already won a lot of money, joined many dollars 
It's not you who'll tell me what to do brothers 
Don't try to be richer than me, so quick 
Don't teach me to play, buy on monday his bitch 
I'm rich, more for you cope, I'm stanky rich
You try to tell me how to play basketball 
I know how the music of your calls 
All want to be 50 Cent's G-Unit, all all
Look how I arrive that Benz, yeah DUB 
Em says that I have to stop with that of club 
Watch the money pile up (yeahhh)
In this music I don't committed any crime 
I don't speak to you stay on the line 
"PIMP" or "Candy Shop" you listen in your car every time 
I'll be with a champagne, Dom PÃ©rignon
I'm a very rich man, you love my song
[bells][shots][ambulance][shots]
Hahahaha

[talking]
Yeah, Haaa
I said that one day you'll fall on my feet
There was neither the beginning your shit
Yeah pick up the phone...
And listen to the breath of fear, this is my zone
I'm bulletproof nigga
Shots, shots and shots, listen to the sound of violence
The singing of weapons you don't know
You never shot anyone in your shit
Yeah you may be ending now
The distance from my hands to you's so short
You fall and I still... I run New York
Girls are always me
An animal sex, I'm so seductive!
Hahahaha
