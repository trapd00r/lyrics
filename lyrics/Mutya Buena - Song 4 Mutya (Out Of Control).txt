You're gone now, I feel fine
Sombeody met you, I feel fine
What about you? I bet you been cryin'
I bet you been goin' around town lyin' (hey!)

I'm drivin' fast, I feel so fine
I got Prince singing "Hot Thing" to me
I know every line
So I pulled up to the red light
Sittin' there in my car
I looked up to my right
And there you are!

Sat there with some new girl, what is this?
Don't panic panic, Mutya, don't drive erratic (hey!)
That's who has replaced me? What a diss!
Don't panic panic, don't act too manic manic

It's a sure fire way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life
There you are again
But don't react now
You can't go back now
Don't panic panic, Mutya
Just look ahead now

(Out of control)

Let's cut to it, my girl for lunch
I was feeling on top of the world
And I just got a hunch
You inside, behind my back
Didn't need to turn around
I felt sick at the thought
He laughed aloud

Sat there with some new girl, what is this?
Don't panic panic, Mutya, don't drive erratic (hey!)
That's who has replaced me? What a diss!
Don't panic panic, don't act too manic manic

It's a sure fire way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life
There you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now (no no no)
Don't panic panic, Mutya, just look ahead now

(Out of control)

It's a sure fire way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life
There you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Don't panic panic, Mutya, just look ahead now...
