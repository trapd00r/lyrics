I be the same when it all goes up
I be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one, open it up
I be the last one closin it out
Don’t know if I’ll give you a shot yet
Lil Mama I’m peepin your style
Do I think you’re dope enough, yup
One way of findin it out
The way you came at me, boo
Don’t care, not afraid I’m like Wild
Really want it from head to toe
Question if she gon let it out
Anyway the hour glass go
I don’t worry anyhow
Why don’t we see where it go
Let’s figure it out

(Chorus)
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
In the morning after
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
In the morning after Dark

Owww, Oooohhh Owww

Come on SoShy

[SoShy]
I got a little secret for ya
I never sleep when comes the night
But everytime I smack my fingers
I switch back into the light
My moon belong to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust
Something that I just can’t describe (ah)
Am I the one and only (ah)
Cause you’re the only one (ah)
It felt so long and lonely (ah)
Waiting for you to come…
It’s lookin bright and early
I’m willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story
Timbo and SoShy

(Chorus)
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
In the morning after
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
In the morning after Dark

Go Nelly!

[Nelly Furtado]
I like some REM but
I don't like sleepin alone
So come and pick me up as
soon as you put down the phone
I wanna get into trouble
Later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover
I just wanna ride on your bone
Yes I'm the one and only, but I'm not the only one
So let's work overtime
on this shift stay up with the sun
Maybe we can start a riot
Maybe we can bomb this town
Maybe I'll be your vampire
We can figure it out!


(Chorus)
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
In the morning after
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
In the morning after Dark

Dark dark dark dark dark
In the morning after dark
Dark dark dark dark dark
In the morning after dark
Please don’t leave me girl
In the morning after dark
Please don’t leave me girl

(Please don’t leave me girl)

When the cats come out the bats come out to playy..
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy..
Play play..
The dawn is here be on your way
When the cats come out the bats come out to playy..
Play play play..
The dawn is here be on your way (way way way way…)
