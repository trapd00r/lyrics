Stars in the night is a natural thing
Come see the joy of the light that I bring.
I'm riding on a cloud like a dream come true
Releasing all my love
I wanna give it to you.

I'm riding on a cloud like a dream come true
Releasing all my love
I wanna give it to you.

Me take control of your soul
Let me be the one that you call
Me don't wanna wait, me don't wanna wait
If you want me tell me that straight
Take ya shake ya me don't wanna fake ya
Just play the beats that will wake ya
So if you wanta listen some diggi diggi dum dum.

Do you see the star shining light, high up in the sky,
Tell me why, I have to be so far away.

Me wanta know, me wanta know,
Come follow me and check me intro
Me gotta go deep me gotta go deep,
Me give my soul for you to keep,
Take your chance (i) know you wanna dance
Give your body let me put you in trance
So if you wanta listen to the drum diggi diggi dum dum.

Do you see the star shining light, high up in the sky, tell me why,
I have to be so far away.
