It's pure obsession
That's in your eyes
Some call it dangerous
I call it a crime
You love your money
Say it loves you too
You think it's the only thing
That shows you gratitude
I can't believe how you live
You got nothing to give

[Chorus:]
It's all part of the greed machine
Make your mark on the
Greed machine
Cut out the heart of the
Greed machine

Stare in your mirror
And tell me what you see
Is that a vision
Or our society
Now you have to face it
And why'd you have to lie
Put the poor back on the streets
And leave them here to die
You can't afford the price you'll pay
Your soul stripped away

[Chorus]

Now you're dying
Why should people care
They're all just trying
To get their rightful share
We have no pity
See they have it all their way
No one to grieve for them
On their judgement day
You have to face all your sins
Your hell now begins

[Chorus]
