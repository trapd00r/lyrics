More love, more time
Give me more love, give me more time

I can't understand it
Maybe you've found someone new
Tell me what did I do wrong
What did I do

Looking in your eyes now
I don't see the love we had
I don't see compassion
I don't see anything

Give me just a little more love
Some more to tide me over
Give me just a little passion
Give me just a little more love
And a little more time

I don't see the reason
Why you should be so unfair
But I have seen it coming
Seen it hanging in the air

Give me just a little more love
Some more to tide me over
Give me just a little passion
Give me just a little more love
And a little more time

Baby when you hold me
You don't touch me like you did
But still I want you by my side
Baby I'll do anything

Give me just a little more love
Some more to tide me over
Give me just a little passion
Give me just a little more love
And a little more time

I can see you're slipping away from me
But I still feel the magic sometimes
When we touch
You and me, it has to be'
'Cos baby without you
I don't think that I can carry on
