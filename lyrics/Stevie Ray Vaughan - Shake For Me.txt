Well, it sure look good, but it don't mean a thing to me
Yes it sure look good, but it don't mean a thing to me
I've got a cool shakin' baby, shake like a wildwood tree

You went away baby, you got back a little too late
You went away baby, you got back a little too late
I've got a cool shakin' baby, shake like jello on a plate

When my baby walks, you know she's fine and mellow
Yeah, when my baby walks, you know she's fine and mellow
Yes and when she stops, her flesh, it shakes like jello

Well now, shake little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah now, shake little baby
Shake it for me
Yeah now, shake a little baby
Shake like a wildwood tree

Now let it shake, now let it shake
Now let it shake, now let it shake
Let it shake a little baby
Shake like a wildwood tree
