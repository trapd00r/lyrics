It seems like everybody wants to play
They wanna buy it for a price
I'm no exception 'cause I play the game
Until you opened my mind
Like you do sometimes

Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie
Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie

I hear those haters screaming every day
They got me heavy, weighed down
Then you came and sang your song, lovely day
They need to hear that sound
Like I do right now

Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie
Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie

Ooh, love is enough
Oh, it's enough to give it up
When we blame it on each other
Love is enough
But it's enough to lift you up
When you give it to another
Love is enough

I saw a little boy the other day
Yeah, he was acting too strong
All it took was a little girl to change his face
And she was singing your song
And I sang along

Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie
Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie

Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie
Heal the love and the love will stay
Feeling your love in a whole new way
Sweet Valerie, Valerie
