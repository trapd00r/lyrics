Chorus 
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair 
In 77 and 69 revolution was in the air 
I was born too late to a world that doesn't care 
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair 

When the head of state didn't play guitar, 
Not everybody drove a car, 
When music really mattered and radio was king, 
When accountants didn't have control 
And the media couldn't buy your soul 
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything 

Chorus 

When popstars still remained a myth 
And ignorance could still be bliss 
And when God Saved the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale 
When my mom and dad were in their teens
and anarchy was still a dream 
and the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail 

Chorus 

When record shops were on top 
and vinyl was all that they stocked 
and the super-info highway was still drifting out in space 
kids were wearing hand me downs, 
and playing games meant kick arounds 
and footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face 

Chorus 

I was born too late to a world that doesn't care 
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
