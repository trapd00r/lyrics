Young, gifted and black
Oh, what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world, you know
There's a million boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black
And that's a fact

Young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
This is a quest that's just begun

When you feel really low
Yeah, there's a great truth you should know
To be young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

Oh, the young, gifted and black
Oh, how I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth

Oh, but my joys of today
Is that we can all be proud to say
To be young, gifted and black
Is where it's at
