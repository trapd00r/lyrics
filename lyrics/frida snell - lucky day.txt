So in the end I cross the line 
You walk your way and I walk mine 
The sky is falling down from above 
The birds are silent when we lose our love 

I've got to turn around 
I've got to walk away 
I'm running out of choices 
Feeling that I'll run astray 
I've got to give it up 
I've got to let you go 
I'm gonna shape it up 
But I'm falling, I'm fainting 
I'm watching it's blowing away 
It ain't my lucky day today 

I look at you and you look at me 
We're lost as far as I can see 
My heart is trembling like a frozen dove 
The darkest night when we lose our love

I've got to turn around 
I've got to walk away 
I'm running out of choices 
Feeling that I'll run astray 
I've got to give it up 
I've got to let you go 
I'm gonna shape it up 
But I'm falling, I'm fainting 
I'm watching it's blowing away 
It ain't my lucky day today

I've got to turn around 
I've got to walk away 
I'm running out of choices 
Feeling that I'll run astray 
I've got to give it up 
I've got to let you go 
I'm gonna shape it up 
But I'm falling, I'm fainting 
I'm watching it's blowing away 
It ain't my lucky day today

It ain't my lucky day today
