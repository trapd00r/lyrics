I hear people talkin' bad
About the way we have to live here in this country
Harpin' on the wars we fight
And gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be
I don't mind 'em switchin' sides
And standin' up for things they believe in
When they're runnin' down my country
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me

Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
If you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me

I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims he just don't believe in fightin'
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on bein' free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of livin'
When they're runnin' down my country, hoss
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me

Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
If you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me

Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me
Runnin' down the way of life
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
If you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
