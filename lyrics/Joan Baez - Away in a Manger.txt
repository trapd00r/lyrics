Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the Heavens
Look down where lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing
The baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love thee Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
'Til morning is nigh
