Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, till we go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away

What I really wanna do
Is just dance with you
And feel your body tight
Show ya how to do it right
I can show you every move
I know just what to do
Each step we do is so fine
One dance and you'll be mine

So baby when we hit the floor
You'll be asking for more
Let's make love and dance the night away

Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, till we go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away

Oh put your hand in mine (hand in mine)
Promise I'll take my time (take my time)
We'll dance from head to toe (head to toe)
I can dance fast or slow (fast or slow)
Baby look into my eyes (into my eyes)
Let the music hypnotize (hypnotize)
Let our bodies synchronize (let our bodies synchronize)
When we're dancing you'll be mine (you'll be mine)

So baby when we hit the floor
You'll be asking for more
Let's make love and dance the night away

Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, till we go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away

Oh when it comes to dancing
I know how to move
When it comes to passion
I know just what to do
I feel the music inside
I feel like I am alive
The tempo is right
Let's make love

Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, till we go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away

Oh come and dance
Let's dance
The night
Let's make love and dance the night away

Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, till we go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away
