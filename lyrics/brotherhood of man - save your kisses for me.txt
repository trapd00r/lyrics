Though it hurts to go away, it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go:
I love you (I love you), you know
I'll be thinkin' of you in most everything I do

Now the time is movin' on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hangin' on for one more smile
I love you (I love you) all the while
With your cute little wave
Will you promise that you'll save your...

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know I'll have to say

That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds till I'm home with you
I love you (I love you), it's true
You're so cute honey, gee
Won't you save them up for me? Your...

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know you've got to save your...

Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Won't you save them for me
Even though you're only three?
