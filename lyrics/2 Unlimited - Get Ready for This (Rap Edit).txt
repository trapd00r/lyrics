Ya'll ready for this?

Get down with the style, house on the ground
Please when I squeeze, drop to your knees
Who wants to play? I'm in here to stay
Ready to take you around the way
So get ready for this. Mind your own biz
'Cause I invented the microphone biz
No need to sit, cause we're 2 Unlimited
Ready, ready, ready for this!

Feel the base, you just get closer
Be impressed by the words I chose of
Once again kickin' it live
Doin' everything, yo, just to survive
A wall to wall, I think I stand
Being on stage with a mic in my hand
Bustin' it live to the crowd
The age is twenty, I'm from the south

Be a part, break my heart
Get ready for this, mind your own biz
People in the front, show me what you want
And I won't give it in...
Get ready for this!
We're 2 Unlimited, so people won't you sit?
Movin' up and down, dancin' all around
Feelin' kinda free; security
House is style that moves you from the ground

House on the ground, bass in your face
Racin' the place, no time to waste
Feelin' hypnotized, I can see it in your eyes
Feelin' kinda better, put on your sweater
Feelin' like a white, I think it doesn't matter
Super, dope, deaf, and even outrageous
If I was an animal, they've kept me in cages
So get ready for this!
Ya'll ready for this?
