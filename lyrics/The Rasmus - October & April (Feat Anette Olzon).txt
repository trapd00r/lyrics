She was like April sky
Sunrise in her eyes
Child of light
Shining star
Fire in her heart
Brightest day
Melting snow
Breaking through the chill
October and April

He was like frozen sky
In October night
Darkest cloud
Endless storm
Raining from his heart
Coldest moon
Deepest blue
Tearing down the spring
October and April

Like hate and love
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
Like light and dark
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start

We were like loaded guns
Sacrificed our lives

We were like love undone
Craving to entwine

Fatal touch
Final thrill
Love was bound to kill
October and April

Like hate and love
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
Like light and dark
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start

Hate and love
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start
Light and dark
Worlds apart
This fatal love
Was like poison
Right from the start

October and April
October and April
October and April
