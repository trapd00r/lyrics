She's a cool blonde scheming bitch
She makes my body twitch
Walking down the corridor
You can hear her stilettos click
I want her so much I feel sick
The girl can't help it, she really can't help it now

It's like a highschool, highschool confidential

Teenage brandos stalk her in the halls
They tease her with cat calls
She's a combination anita eckberg, mamie van doren


Dagmar highschool confidential

What's the principal doin' with her who's that girl
Is she screwing with her
What's her perfume: tigress by faberg√©
She makes me cream my jeans
When she's coming my way

She drives a candy pink cadillac
If I don't get her soon, I'll have a heart attack
When she flashes me a look I wanna burn my books
Givin'up, givin'up, givin'up high-high-high...
