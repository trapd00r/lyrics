Sancho Panza, this is me. I'm your Sancho 
Panza. I get along, I know my ground. With me 
around, there's room for you to be amazing. 

I'm the one they don't remember. Were you in 
our school? they say. I get asked about my name 
again Panza, Panza, Panza. 

Around the boulevards we walk, the sun is 
always on your face, and I am always in your 
shade, and I am always the funny one. How I 
hate being the funny one, I never chose to be 
her, it strikes me as unfair. 

And people at our feet to be with us. Such a small 
comfort l'm so used to this it turned me creative.
