Never hesitate knowin' you can call on, your soul-mate

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks
And gifts that you cop me baby (ooh)
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80 (yeah)
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get as hot July it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and ever
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely (lonely)
