Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree, I
Said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is, chocolate-covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
It puts over me

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your
Strength

Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the Earth
The Sun was just yellow energy

There is a living promise land
And even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind, and cover me
Bringing back, more than a memory


Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your strength...

You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over, the sides...
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your strength

Give me your strength (chariot)
Give me your strength (chariot)
Give me your strength (chariot)
Give me your strength (chariot)

Give me your strength
Give it to me (chariot)
Give me your strength
Give it to me (chariot)
Give me your strength
Give it to me (chariot)

Give me your strength
Oh chariot
