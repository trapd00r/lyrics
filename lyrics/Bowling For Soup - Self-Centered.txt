I got it stuck in a bind
I don't even know why
It sucks to even try
But I won't try anymore
She took the afternoon train
To find a different plane
But life down the drain's 
Better than being ignored

I think I'm taking a vacation now
(I'm on holiday)
And maybe I won't rest
Until I've thrown it all away
I've got it down

I'm gonna feel sorry for myself
I want to blame it on everyone else
I want to be self-centered 
And make everybody feel sorry for me

Yeah

She sent a postcard again
She said she had a new friend 
I hope that by the end 
He throws her heart on the floor
She said he's really okay
I really hope that he's gay
It's not a nice thing to say 
But I don't care anymore

I think I'm taking a vacation now
(I'm on holiday)
And maybe I won't rest 
Until I've thrown it all away
I've got it down

I'm gonna feel sorry for myself
I want to blame it on everyone else
I want to be self-centered 
And make everybody feel sorry for me

I'm gonna feel sorry for myself
I want to blame it on everyone else
I want to be self-centered 
And make everybody feel sorry for me

My leg fell asleep 'cause you laid on it
There's no reason to dwell on it
It's just not worth it
Remember a year ago 
When we played in the snow
Now get out of my head (get out of my head)

I want to feel sorry for myself
I want to blame it on everyone else
I want to be self-centered 
And make everybody feel sorry for me

I'm gonna feel sorry for myself
I want to blame it on everyone else
I want to be self-centered 
And make everybody feel sorry for me
Feel sorry (sorry, sorry) 
For me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
