Sleep
Sleep with the lights on
Shuttered with shades drawn
There's too many windows

Noise
Cars on the freeway
Tempting a clean break
But there's nowhere left to go

Watching the roots weave
Through cracks in the concrete

Plates they will shift
Houses will shake
Fences will drift
We will awake
Only to find
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same

Home 
Home is a fire
A burning reminder
Of where we belong, love

With walls 
Built up around us
The bricks make me nervous
They're only so strong, love
Yes they're only so strong, love

Plates they will shift
Houses will shake
Fences will drift
We will awake
Only to find
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
As yesterday
As yesterday
