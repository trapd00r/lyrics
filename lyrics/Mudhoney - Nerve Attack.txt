With a turn of a key and a flick of a latch
The door flew open and I fell back
And all the darkness in my mind
Filled with rue and struck me blind

I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I'll tell you what, this ain't no blast
Oh, it's a nerve attack, a nerve attack, oh no

All my atoms are vibratin' faster
Don't you touch because I will shatter
My skin is crackin', and so is my brain
Can't catch my breath, get out of my way

I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I'll tell you what, this ain't no blast
Oh, it's a nerve attack, a nerve attack, oh no

And all the darkness in my mind
Filled the world and struck me blind
I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
And this ain't no gas, gas, gas
Oh, it's a nerve attack, it's a nerve attack
A nerve attack, oh yeah
Whoa no no, no no, no no no
