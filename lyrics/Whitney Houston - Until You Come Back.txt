I lost my heart a long time ago
You made me feel like no one had before
Boy, you made me love you
Then you walked out the door
See, I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours

And boy I won't stop
And nothing I won't give you up
And you gotta feel something, I know
I will not love again until you come back
Come back to my arms
Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back

Don't care how long baby
It's not important to me (no no no no)
Don't care how far
Love's never too far for me (oh no honey)
I'd just might be crazy (yes I)
When it comes to my heart
But I cannot rest until the day we're no longer apart

And boy I won't stop
And nothing I won't give you up
And you gotta feel something, I know
I will not love again until you come back
Come back to my arms
Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back to me

Nobody plays with my heart
You can't walk away from me at all (oh baby)
You can run but your heart cannot hide
'Cause it knows you belong in my life

And boy I won't stop
And nothing I won't give you up
And you gotta feel something, I know
I will not love again until you come back
Come back to my arms
Till you come back to me baby
Until you come back to me (oh yeah)
Till you come back to me baby
Come on home, come home to me
