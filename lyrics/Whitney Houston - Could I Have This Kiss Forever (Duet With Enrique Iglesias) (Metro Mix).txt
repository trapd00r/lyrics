WHITNEY: 
Dame un beso para siempre 

ENRIQUE: 
Over and over I look in your eyes 
You are all I desire
You have captured me 
I want to hold you
I want to be close to you 
I never want to let go 

WHITNEY: 
I wish that this night would never end 
I need to know 

CHORUS (together): 
Could I hold you for a lifetime 
Could I look into your eyes 
Could I have this night to share this night together 
Could I hold you close beside me 
Could I hold you for all time 
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever 

WHITNEY: 
Over and over I've dreamed of this night 
Now you're here by my side
You are next to me 
(You are next to me) 
I want to hold you and touch you and taste you 
And make you want no one but me 
I wish that this kiss could never end
Oh baby please 

CHORUS: 
Could I hold you for a lifetime 
Could I look into your eyes 
Could I have this night to share this night together 
Un beso para siempre (Enrique), 
Para siempre (Whitney) 
Could I hold you close beside me 
Could I hold you for all time 
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever 

BRIDGE(together) 
I don't want any night to go by 
Without you by my side 
I just want all my days 
Spent being next to you 
Lived for just loving you 
And baby, oh by the way 

CHORUS 
Sólo, sólo un beso, un beso para siempre (Enrique) 
Para siempre (Whitney) 
Dame un beso para siempre (Enrique) 
Para siempre (Whitney) 
Could I have this kiss forever 
Could I have this kiss forever
