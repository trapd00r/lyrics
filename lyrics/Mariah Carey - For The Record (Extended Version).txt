Baby. baby. baby...

(Perfume commercial rambling)

For the record, you ought to know
You wasn't thinking when you let me go
But whatever that's how it goes
Win some you lose some and others you hold in your heart
Why it gets so hard tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go no, no, no
Suddenly you're here
And it's all surreal
And I don't know what the deal

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't want to spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try
One time
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like the first time

Them other regularities they can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me
People see you now asking all about me and
How they
Always thought we were so "perfect" together
Let's rewrite the end
Start over again
It's gonna go better now

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't want to spend my life
Thinkin' what it could've been like
If we had another try
One time
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like the first time

For the record...
"You'll always be a part of me" no matter what you do
For the record
Can't nobody say I didn't give "my all" to you
For the record...
I told you "underneath the stars" that you "belong" to me
And for the record...
It's obvious that we just "can't let go" of us "HONEY"

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't want to spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try
One time
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like the first time

Looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't want to spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try
One time
Like back in the days
That look on your face
Feels like the first time
Just for the record baby
Now you know
