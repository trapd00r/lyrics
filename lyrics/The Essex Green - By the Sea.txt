A moment taken slowly by the sea
Wind blowing down
Bells ring a sigh, of good morning, goodbye...

Faces pass you by on a blue train flyin' high
Who do you see this time?

Everybody's talkin' at once
They got the look of a stranger
Ooh...

The shoreline is a map, as sure as anyone you've ever known
Tracing the way
To good morning, good day...
