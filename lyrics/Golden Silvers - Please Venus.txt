She was a murderess in a million dollar dress
Far from these haunted shores she went
She was a billionaire just like the girl with flaxen hair
A beauty queen from the scene she had been set
Beneath those wide dark eyes
She was never satsified

Please Venus lay your head down low
Tomorrow find somewhere else to call your home
When you rise again the dunes will dance
The sand will sing the silver shells will glow
O your love has gone but your not alone

So as she left the sands
A dream boat with hard lock hands
Fingers full of pearl rings
Should have seen her shake her tambourine
And her pride and joy, was her darling boy
He came invisible and disappeared into the screen
And beneath those city lights
Her heart started beating like dynamite

Please venus lay your head down low
Tomorrow find somewhere else to call your home
When you rise again the dunes will dance
The sand will sing the silver shells will glow
O your love has gone but your not alone

And you'll find her at the fairground
At the end of the pier
Watching all the ships go by
With the shell against her ear
And now she takes her leave
Cos there's nothing left here to believe
And she walks beneath the waves once more
She rides again
Riding a shell some kind of hollow eve
And walks upon new golden shore
And if you see her go ask her where's she's been
Just kneel and follow the sound of that tambourine

Please venus lay your head down low
Tomorrow find somewhere else to call your home
When you rise again the dunes will dance
The sand will sing the silver shells will glow
O your love has gone but your not alone x2
