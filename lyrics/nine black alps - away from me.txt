Foolin' the words with my pen
Losin' my place on the page
Sickness was my only friend
Help me and sold me again
I don't need a cannon ball
To feel like I'm free
Don't need a miracle, to see

Get them away, away from me
I fallen out of every scene
Stop with the past, starting on me
Get them away, away from me

Torn out of home's where I'd stay
Falling to pieces again
Bruised under alien skies
Endlessly hopelessly high
I don't need a cannon ball
To feel like I'm free
Don't need a miracle, to see

Get them away, away from me
I fallen out of every scene
Stop with the past, starting on me
Get them away, away from me.
