All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down!

It's me against the music
It's just me
And me
Yeah
C'mon
Hoah
Hey Britney
Are you ready?
Uh huh
Are you?
Uh

And no one cares
ItÂ´s whippinÂ´my hair, itÂ´s pullinÂ´ my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is drippinÂ´ all over my face
And no oneÂ´s there
IÂ´m the only one dancinÂ´ up in this place
Tonight IÂ´m here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta get with that bass

IÂ´m up against the speaker, tryinÂ´ to take on the music
ItÂ´s like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone, I wanna get in a zone (I wanna get in a zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
TryinÂ´ to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute IÂ´m a take a you on, IÂ´m a take a you on (I'm a take a you on)
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantinÂ´ more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people round and round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

So how would you like a friendly competition?
LetÂ´s take on the song (Let's take on the song, let's take on the song)
ItÂ´s you and me baby, weÂ´re the music
Time to party all night long (All night long, all night long)

Hoah, huh, yeah, let's go!

WeÂ´re almost there
IÂ´m feelinÂ´ it bad and I canÂ´t explain
My soul is bare
My hips are movinÂ´ at a rapid pace
Baby feel it burn
From the tip of my toes, runninÂ´ through my veins
And nowÂ´s your turn
Let me see what you got, donÂ´t hesitate

IÂ´m up against the speaker, tryinÂ´ to take on the music
ItÂ´s like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone, I wanna get in a zone (I wanna get in a zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
TryinÂ´ to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute IÂ´m a take a you on, IÂ´m a take a you on (I'm a take a you on)
Hey, hey, hey

[Repeat Chorus]

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go (Let it go)
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney
We can dance all night long

Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here I got somethinÂ´ to show ya
Sexy lady, IÂ´d rather see you bare your soul
If you think youÂ´re so hot, better show me what you got
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
(Grab a partner, take it down!)
CÂ´mon Britney lose control, watch you take it, take it down
(Grab a partner, take it down!)

Get on the floor, baby lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney
We can dance all night long

[Repeat Chorus]

All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
(Grab a partner, take it down!)
CÂ´mon Britney lose control
Watch you take it, take it down
(Grab a partner, take it down!)

Hmm. . .
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh!
