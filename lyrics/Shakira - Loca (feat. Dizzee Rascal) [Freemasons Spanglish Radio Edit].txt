Shakira
Loca...
Loca...
Dance or die...
Loca...
Loca...

She's playing dumb all the time
Just to keep it fun
To get you on like ah
Be careful amigo
She talking and walking just to work you up
And she'd die for your love
But your love's only mine, now
Yo sigo tranquila
Like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sipping my Corona
Like there's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone
What is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it
So give him up

And I'm crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
And you like that it ain't easy (loca, loca, loca)
And I'm crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
I'm Crazy but you like it

Dizzee
That girl is a nutter
Hot though, I heat up when I touch her
Chica caliente got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean ol'bumper you should
See what she does with it
She dip it down low (down low, down low)
I can never get enough (oh no, oh no)
She give me the runaround,
But I stay chasin'
But I need help I'm in love
With a crazy girl
But it's all good
And it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, "Ay, papi"

Shakira
And I'm crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it ain't easy (loca, loca, loca)
I'm crazy but you like it
Crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think she's got it all
I got one kiki

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she's got it all
I got my kiki

Shakira
Ok she doesn't know the the things that I do to please you
I take you to the malecón por un caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
'Cause we were dancing mambo
What she don't allow?

Dizzee Rascal
I really can't help it
If I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble
I just wanna hit the (Ooh!)

Shakira
And I'm crazy, but you like it
'Cause the kinda girl like me
They are running out of in the market

And I'm crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it ain't easy (loca, loca, loca)
I'm crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
Crazy but you like it (Dios Mío)

Dizzee
That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)
Loca
That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)

Shakira
You're the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think she's got it all
I got my kiki

And I'm crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it ain't easy (loca, loca, loca)
La loca, la loca, la loca (loca)
Loca (loca)

(Loca, loca, loca)
