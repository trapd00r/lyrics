(I wanna dance. I wanna dance. Y'all ready?) 
Dance music, doing nothing but dance music 
For those who want to dance and use it on the dance floor 
For those who want more 
For all you people who know what you came for 
Music, music of a floor filler kind 
Lyrics by the Melodie and Statikk right behind 
Me, back-up from Tom quite eventually 
Kicking some ass in the music industry 
Kaos, all over the world they play us 
Kaos is where we're ending up if you don't pay us well 
Now maybe that line will ring a bell 
'Cause some of you people just think that we sell 
Out, but tell me what's it, what's it all about 
Immature talk when you only scream and shout 
Without knwledge, seems to me you've never even been to collage 
But still you want the gold chain and the Rolex 
But now enough about that 
You wanna dance, the dance floor's where we're heading at 
So come follow me, check out the Melodie 
And I will move your ass permanently 

I wanna dance. I wanna dance. I wanna dance 
You wanna dance but you don't know how to 
I wanna dance 
Follow the Melodie and I will show you 
I wanna dance 
Check it in check it out check 1 2 
I wanna dance 
Is this a thing you wanna wanna wanna do ? 
I wanna dance 
You wanna dance but you don't know how to 
I wanna dance 

Now let me prove to you all (prove what) that I'm able 
To grab a microphone and plug it straight into a cabel 
Connect the cable to the power of the P.A. 
And through the mighty speakers I will say what I wanna say 
(So give it up, give, give it up) for the Melodie 
Who fucking gives a shit about what you say, broadcaster DJ ? 
To me you're nothing but a big joke 
And if stick to your style then you stick to being broke 
Listen, this is the part that you've been missing 
Better know now what to say before you muther fuckin' dissing 
Me, Melodie profession is MC 
And by the way I think I speak for the S.L.P. direct 
When I say suckers don't get respect 
And when I do a diss I always diss in full effect 
So when you standing there and telling me what to do 
I don't give a shit because the shit is coming from you 
But now enough about that 
You wanna dance, the dance floor's where we're heading at 
So come follow me, check out the Melodie 
And I will move your ass permanently 

Now let me pick it, pick it up where I left it 
Give me some drums some beats 
And I will get the people interested right away 
'Cause this is no average everyday 
Poetry, this is some lyrics by the Melodie 
Kicking, kicking on radio, kicking on TV 
Kicking on the dance floor for the needy 
'Cause dance music's what we always do 
And dance music is what we gonna continue to develop 
So put your ass off and shut the hell up 
And wait for my signal to jump up and jump up and move 
To the funky rhythm to the groove 
And as we continue my rhymes will improve 
But now enough about that 
You wanna dance, the dance floor's where we're heading at 
So come follow me, check out the Melodie 
And I will move your ass permanently
