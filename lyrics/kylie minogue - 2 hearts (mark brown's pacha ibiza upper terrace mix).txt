You make me invisible
Like sky you make my day
And I feel so wonderful
Oh, oh, oh, don?t let go

I?m seeing the dark of you
It feels like I never saw the sun
Should I shout for a rescue?
Oh, oh, oh, don?t let go
Oh, oh, oh, don?t let go

2 hearts are beating together
I?m in love, I?m in love
Is this forever and ever?
I?m in love, I?m in love

2 hearts are beating together
I?m in love, I?m in love
Is this forever and ever?
I?m in love, I?m in love

Looks good in sunshine
Well, hold on ?cause I?m coming up for air
And I can?t even see up here
Oh, oh, oh, don?t let go
Oh, oh, oh, don?t let go

2 hearts are beating together
I?m in love, I?m in love
Is this forever and ever?
I?m in love, I?m in love

2 hearts are beating together
I?m in love, I?m in love
Is this forever and ever?
I?m in love, I?m in love

2 hearts
I?m in love, I?m in love
Is this forever and ever?
I?m in love, I?m in love
2 hearts
