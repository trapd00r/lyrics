I'm just a girl ...
I'm innocent
Come take my hand
I'll show you the world of my own ...

Your just a boy ...
Who makes me weak who takes my sleep
I need you to dance the night away ...

I can't stand it anymore now baby
The music makes me feel so crazy
So come on and and take my hand
And I'll show you the way to dance
And again and again
I need that feeling
Cause baby I know I'm not dreaming
So come on and take my hand
And I'll show you to promise land

I'm just a girl ...
I'm innocent
Come take my hand
I'll show you the world of my own ...

Your just a boy ...

I need you to dance the night away ...

The music makes me feel so crazy
So come on and and take my hand
And I'll show you the way to dance
And again and again
I need that feeling
Cause baby I know I'm not dreaming
So come on and take my hand
And I'll show you to promise land
