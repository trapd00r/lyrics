She took a lightsaber to my heart
And she picked my brain with a pocketknife
She said, "Say what's on your mind"
So I said, "I'm kinda hungry and I hate my life"

She said I was cold as hell
But hell's not cold, I know
I know 'cause I've been there for the last half-hour or so
And the devil says it never snows

I guess I should wait awhile and see if the temperature changes
I guess I should hang awhile and try on a few more faces for you
She took me out on a shopping binge
'Cause you thought I was hurting for some cooler clothes
She said, "Don't you wanna be all that?
Like a Calvin Klein model in a video?"

She said I was cold as hell
But hell's not cold, I know
I know 'cause I've been there for the last half-hour or so
And the devil said it never snows there
