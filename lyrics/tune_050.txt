My mind state brings the current weather degree in my place
The Netherlands never had summer this hot
Cuz my thoughts race across the place making the molecules vibrate
And that won't stop
Half a year in the game and I already changed this countries climate
The bars climb mate degrees change
Its hot only i got a drop to hydrate
Hop on to my greatness get life saved
Ride my wave cuz tides change
I might reface the landscape
Accept time change
Album of the year with light on my face
I don't have an album lets make that clear
Rewind this tune in a couple years
Be reminded its true what i'm spitting in ya ear
Then be blinded by the truth i made a here
So mate here, to make clear, i made here, the statement
I changed gears, now time to change years
Before i disappear, and vacation on mars
I'm waldo everywhere and nowhere you thought
You can find me in 050 and ya heart
This my city time to break it apart
Here we don't sell heroin to billy
Here we move coke and push clicks to kiddies
Small town lotsa snow you know its chilly
Farmers filling depots with their pillies
Selling hope you can get 10 for fifty
I guess its okay if your broke and want a penny
But that dope has changed lives, many
Rap competition is here, not really
Time to heat it up hold litty under gas
Now that will put Roden on the map
Cuz i won't stop till nest makes a blast
And everyone is put as last
When do people start appreciating my craft
How many words i gotta rhyme to get respect
How many fans i need to get stacks
Man fuck all of that, bring the positive side
For the people who are true i give m positive rhymes
You can't yet see me live, but on a positive side
The stats climb, giving me a positive vibe
In a few years ill be on stage poppin it right
Til then i'm with the homies hiphopping it right
Hop on tracks hopping off when tight
Then we mix and master till the vocals is bright
That's the life i wanna live
But before that i gotta give all these rappers hell
And start dealing with everyone for a deal
And kill everyone for a mill
They would say Jerome chill
But there ain't no way for me to sit still
Until i got a mill a bill and ya feel its real
That's just how i feel
Waldo trained to kill without blood spill
