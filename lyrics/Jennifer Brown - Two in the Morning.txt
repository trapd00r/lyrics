I want to be the girl who makes it under your skin so you can't sleep.
I want to be the one who makes your body stiff and your conscience weak.
You're gonna leave your senses and your confidences.

CHORUS
I want you to be my two in the morning desperation call.
I want you to shout my name without warning
when the phone rings at two in the morning.

I want you to see my body naked touching you in every dream,
so when I tie you up and then go down you might not scream.
I wanna be crazy and not care about what people say.
Nobody has to know that I want you to be my slave.

CHORUS
I want you to be my two in the morning desperation call.
I want you to shout my name without warning
when the phone rings at two in the morning.

Don't go to sleep, I just might call, to throw you up against the wall.

I want to be the nice girl that smiles, standing by her man.
But secretly I want you kneeling when I raise my hand.
I wanna be pink and flowers every hour of the day,
but when the nightime comes I wanna switch the role I play,
and leave your senses and confidences.

CHORUS
I want you to be my two in the morning desperation call.
I want you to shout my name without warning
when the phone rings at two in the morning.
