I can live without a broken heart
If you can live within my dreams
The flags are out on a sunny day
All the troubles I have just fade away

When I'm living in the right place
Alliteration comes to mind
The sweetest smile I'll ever find on your face
I can live without a broken heart, you could live within my dreams
I could live without a broken heart if you could live within my dreams

What might have been such a tragic scene just changes
Moves smoothly oh so smoothly into time
I will try it can't deny it if I need it I will bleed for it
Cos it never tastes the same it never tastes the same to me

I can live without a broken heart, you could live within my dreams
I can live without a broken heart, you can live within my dreams
I can live without a broken heart, you can live within my dreams
I could live without a broken heart if you could live within my dreams

The flags are out on a sunny day
All the troubles fade away, it never tastes the same
Alliteration comes to mind, the sweetest smile I'll ever find
It never feels the same without you

I can live without a broken heart, if you could live within my dreams
I can live without a broken heart, if you could live within my dreams
I could live without
I could live without
Could live without
Without
I could live without
