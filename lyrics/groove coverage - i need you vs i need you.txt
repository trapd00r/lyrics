Strophe I

I know there's somethin´in your eyes,
I know there's somethin´in your smile,
makes me feel like loosin´all my thoughts tonight,
Baby. Everyday I read between the lines,
every night I'm searching for your signs.
You belong to heaven's gate,
angel of hope …

Strophe II

So many things I failed to do…
One thousand miles I'd run for you,
you're still the only one I ever need, Baby!
Everyday I read between the lines,
every night I'm waiting for your signs.
You belong to heaven's gate,
angel of hope …

Refrain:

I need you, you're always on my mind.
That's all you left behind, my love will last
eternally …

I need you, like no one else before
You're all that I adore, my love will last 
eternally … I need you …
