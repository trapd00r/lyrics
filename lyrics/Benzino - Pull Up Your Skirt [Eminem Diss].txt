What can I do sell a record? I can't even give this shit away! all my cds all went wood and I got something to say:

Let me start from the beginnin, I GOT NO CLASS, NO LOVE, NO TALENT

IF I COULD BUY EM's HEART MABYBE I COULD START ON SOMETHIN'
But he smoked me on the tracks and his rhymes are gettin' played while
I can't get no respect cause my tired ass is played.



Five shades DUMBER THAN JA RULE, BUT I'M STILL IN THERE SLINGIN'
PAC IS ROLLIN' IN HIS GRAVE AND MY PENIS PUMP IS CRUMPLIN I CAN'T THINK OF A REAL DIS SO I'm GONNA LIFT FROM OTHERS MY OWN PEEPS DON'T ReSPECT ME, SO why should I?
Chin check it Snoopy put a circle on that eye
My time's never up cause real niggas don't die
I'm not Moby, the little puppet on MTV
BUT I'm STILL AFRAID TO FIGHT HIM
Cause moby's twice as man as me

I bring MY MAMA to your living room so you could see me
BEG Yeah you sold alot of units, but you can't be me
So thank the gods of hip hop and the world
That you're not a punk like me

The state of hip hop, will continue to be fucked up
Long as rage like my own source
Are gettin' space on the newsstaand
SEE I'm playin' by a different set of rules you got me fucked up
Respect the hood LIL RAY RAY, or the hood'll take you out
You the real wanksta, and I don't care who you sign

Disrespect Benzino, HELL, YOU GOTTA GET IN LINE!
What you know about pumpin, WILL YOU GIVE MY ASS A TRY?

Meanwhile back in Boston I'm a legend I'M LIKE AN ILLER BILLY BUCKNER
My number in the rafters fuck MY ASS IT's YOURS, I'm BEGGIN

I'M all right but I'M not real (Real)
I DON'T spit I SWALLOW GIMME YOUR steel (Steel)

The two thousand three Vanilla Ice? I TRIED TO BE IT
With that wack redemption shit, but the audience wouldn't
Buy it so I'm back here hawkin rags

If you ask me, I GUESS I'D SAY I'M TRULY UNDERrated
But facts is facts my sales is wack
And I'm not that hard, in fact I'm faded.


Better never let me see you with A HARD ON CAUSE YOU KNOW I'D GIVE YOU SKULLY. SURE I'D BEG FOR A TASTE, CLOSEST I CAN COME TO SHOOTIN' GIFT

And don't forget, how this shit all cccured to me
Your whole camp be surrounded by security
What you want? the black or the chrome? PUT IT IN MY MOUTH, MY MOUTH CAN BE YOUR HOME, HOMEY

I want A TASTE OF YOUR MAGIC SO I'LL BE KNEELIN AT your door
I'll earn my stripes AND THEN I'LL SWALLOW, I'm a pussy
Zino SWEET LIPS WILL WRAP AROUND YOU TILL YOU GIVE ME THAT SWEET NOOKIE
Bottom of the ninth, the scores lookin' crazy
On my block THE GIRLS ALL FLOCK TO THE FLOW OF SWEET Slim Shady

I'M NOT SO WELL, I DON'T FEEL REAL (Real)
LEMME SWALLOW YOU WHOLE I WON'T spit EMINEM, MY MASTER, I WILL KEEP IT REAL (Steel)
I talk shit WITH MY MOUTH FILLED BUT AT LEAST I'LL GET A TASTE OF WHAT THE REAL GIFT REALLY TASTES LIKE, CUZ RIGHT NOW I'VE NEVER killed (Killed)

And that's how the motherfuckin story go
You shoot, I swallow, you spit, I wallow. I been beggin for a taste, so homey come 'n' gimme some. for your little ray-ray punk just a taste will bring me home.
