(spoken)
i think i need a band-aid

dont know his name
but i met him in coquitlam
dorian gray
hanging out at microplay
he said he's tired 
at the age of seventeen
too uninspired 
to ever change the world
puking over toilet bowls all of us look the same
chained to methylynedioxymethamphetamine(???)

[CHORUS]
it's all been done, but we're too young to be jaded
the war's been won, and its not that complicated
we are on our own, and we're just kicking back in oblivion
will you meet me halfway?

give up, you're fucked
they teach you that in c.a.p.p. class
so you've met someone
but how long is it gonna last?
he said he's tired
and he wishes he was sixteen
too uninspired
now isnt that convienient?
puking over toilet bowls all of us look the same
chained to phenobarbitol and polyurethane

[CHORUS]
it's all been done, but we're too young to be jaded
the war's been won, and its not that complicated
we are on our own, and we're just kicking back in oblivion
will you meet me halfway?

do you feel like you've done wrong
though there's nothing to regret.
you're much older than you seem, i always forget
i think both of us are tired, 
we've talked for much too long
we're both younger than we seem
