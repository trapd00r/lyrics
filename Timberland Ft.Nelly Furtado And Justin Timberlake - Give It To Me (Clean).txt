(Timbaland)
Oh yeah boss
Come on

(Nelly Furtado)
I'm the type of girl to look you dead in the eye eye
I'm real as it come if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y-y
I've seen you tryin' to switch it up but girl you ain't that dough
I'm a Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mommy, s√≠ mommy
Amnesty International got bankrupt, I'm on top, on lock
Love my ass and my ass in the video of "Promiscuous"
My status ri-dic-dic-diculous, culous, culous

(Nelly Furtado)
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

(Timbaland)
When Timbo is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-an-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A, all the way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
...talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell them that they can't do it like I can

(Nelly Furtado)
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

(Justin Timberlake)
Could you speak up and stop m-mumbling, I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week, damn, that's right you wasn't there
If s-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my...?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
Cause our run will never be over, not unless until we say

(Nelly Furtado)
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

(Birdo)
Damn, improve
Damn, improve
Damn, improve
Damn, improve

Damn, improve
Damn, improve
Damn, improve
Damn, improve

(Nelly Furtado)
...club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

(Nelly Furtado)
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't hear to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
I wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me.
