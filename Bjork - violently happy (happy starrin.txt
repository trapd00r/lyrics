I've seen it all
I have seen the trees
I have seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze

Thom:
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
And lives that were over before they were spent

Thom and Bjork:
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all there is no more to see

Bjork:
You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru

Thom:
I'm happy to say I had better to do

Bjork:
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?

Thom:
All walls are great if the roof doesn't fall
The man you will marry, the home you will share

Bjork:
To be honest, I really don't care
??

Thom:
You've never been to Niagara Falls?

Bjork:
I have seen water
It's water, that's all

Thom:
The Eiffel Tower
And the Empire State

Bjork:
My pulse was as high
on my very first date

Thom:
Your grandson's hand
As he plays with your hair

Bjork:
To be honest, I really don't care

Thom and Bjork:
I've seen it all
I've seen the dark
I've seen the brightness in one little spark
I've seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
And that is enough
To want more would be greed
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all there is no more to see

Thom:
You've seen it all and all you have seen
You can always review on your own little screen
The light and the dark the big and the small
Just keep in mind you need no more at all

Thom and Bjork:
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be
You've seen it all there is no more to see
