Heartbreak... Heartbreak...
Heartbreak...
Uh!, Oh!, Uh!, Oh!, ...

I've tried to hold myself together
Tried to forget you've gone away
The tears I've cried, they won't subside
Unless the music starts to play

Keep it coming on and on and on

Heartbreak makes me a dancer, dancer
DJ give me the answer, answer
Love, stop getting me down, down, down
Do it alone, I could do it alone
Heartbreak make me a dancer, dancer
Keep my heart beating faster, faster
Love, stop bringing me down, down, down
Do it alone, I could do it alone

I need to feel I'm getting stronger
Long as I'm moving it feels true
And with each step, I will forget
Forget all those memories of you

Keep it coming on and on and on

Heartbreak makes me a dancer, dancer
DJ give me the answer, answer
Love, stop getting me down, down, down
Do it alone, I could do it alone
Heartbreak make me a dancer, dancer
Keep my heart beating faster, faster
Love, stop bringing me down, down, down
Do it alone, I could do it alone

Heartbreak... Heartbreak...
Heartbreak... Heartbreak...

Heartbreak makes me a dancer, dancer
DJ give me the answer, answer
Love, stop getting me down, down, down
Do it alone, I could do it alone
Heartbreak make me a dancer, dancer
Keep my heart beating faster, faster
Love, stop bringing me down, down, down
Do it alone, I could do it alone
