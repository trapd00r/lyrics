Smack me again
And I can't believe it's true
Smashing the opponent
Was not my intention to do
Nether did you
Foresee such an outcome
To this unnecessary ending
I wish I could retrace all my steps
And erase my mistakes
With you

x2

I wanted to say
You shouldn't suffer this way
I wanted to say
I hope I can take it away

Tempt me again and I will forget the truth
Backing your decision
Was something I neglected to do
Even for you
If you feel rageâ€¦ To strike me with revenge
I will be standing right here
Waiting without fear
For you

x6

I wanted to say
You shouldn't suffer this way
I wanted to say
I hope I can take it away
