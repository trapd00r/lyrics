Send "Human Behavior" Ringtone to your Cell If you ever get close to a human 
and human behavior 
Be ready, be ready to get confused 
and me and my here after
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic 
to human behavior 
But yet so, yet so irresistible 
and me and my fear can
and there is no map uncertain.

They're terribly, terribly, terribly moody 
of human behavior
Then all of a sudden, turn happy 
and they and my here after
But oh, to get involved in the exchange 
of human emotions
Is ever so, ever so satisfying 
and they and my here on
And there is no map and chair too

Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior

And there is no map
And a compass wouldn't help at all
Yeah, uncertain

Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human, human, human, human

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human, human, human, human.
