Lil Wayne
Throw dirt on me, and grow a wildflower
But it's fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin' bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars, are full of broken bottles
And my night stands, are full of open Bibles (uhh)

I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire, expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg

Money outweighin', problems on the triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you nigga's skippin' scenes (uhh)
Be good, or be good at it
Fuckin' right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it’s fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

Eminem & Lil Wayne 
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say just don't
(Don't hurt me) That’s right (Don't hurt me) I don't need you (No more) Don't want to see you (No more) Huh
Bitch you get no (No love)

You showed me nothing but hate, you ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And you don't (Don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) And I don't need you (No more) Don't want to see you (No more)
Hah, bitch you get (No love, no love, no love, no love)
Hah, bitch you get (No love, no love, no love) And I don't need you (No more)
Get 'em

Eminem
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been, in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin, to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most, shit's fi'in to get thick again
They say the competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in

I ain't never givin' in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em
They call me a freak 'cause I like to, spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him

Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap is tight but I'm
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time, so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit, and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference, when I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight

It's an adrenaline rush, you feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest, you can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow

Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game, and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it, 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore

And you can never break my stride, you never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin' the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words ain't letting up relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up, you get no love

Eminem & Lil Wayne
It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now (Yeah)

But what comes around goes around (Yeah)
And you don't (Don't hurt me) That's right (You don't hurt me) And I don't need you (No more) Don't want to see you (No more)
Hah, bitch you get (No love, no love, no love, no love)
Hah, bitch you get (No love, no love, no love) And I don't need you (No more)
Bitch you get no (Love, love)
