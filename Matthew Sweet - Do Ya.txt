Ahh...
In this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
I've seen pigs all sittin' watching picture slides
But I never seen nothing like you

Do ya do ya want my life (woman)
Do ya do ya want my love (I'm saying)
Do ya do ya want my face (I need it)
Do ya do ya want my mind

Well I, heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang Auld Lang Syne by the light of the moon
I heard the preachers bangin' on the drums
But I never heard nothin' like you

In the country where the sky touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest in the morning sun
They come a'runnin' just to get a look
Just to feel to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn

Do ya do ya want my life (woman)
Do ya do ya want my love (I'm saying)
Do ya do ya want my face (I need it)
Do ya do ya want my mind

Well I think you understand what I'm trying to say woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know, baby
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do ya do ya want my life (woman)
Do ya do ya want my love (I'm saying)
Do ya do ya want my face (I need it)
Do ya do ya want my mind

Do ya do ya want my life
Do ya do ya want my love
Do ya do ya want my face
Do ya do ya want my mind
