DMX: 

Uh. Yea. Uh. If you love something let it go, if it 
comes back to you it's yours. If it doesn't, it never was. 
Hold me down baby 

Chorus(2x): 
Either let me fly, or give me death 
Let my soul rest, take my breath 
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on 
but I'll be gone any day 

Hold me down, niggaz wanna know me now 
Didn't want ta play wit' me when to show me how 
No meow 
Is it all about the bark ? 
Let the dog lose baby it's about to spark 
Light up the night, like the 4th of July 
Niggaz know, when I let go, niggaz die 
wit' this Y and you don't know you slow like Baltimore 
If you ain't tryin' ta go ya blow 
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence 
When I let go it's violence cause the wildest 
leaves the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat 
in the fog but ya'll niggaz see is the bat 
Flappin' away wit' em blind like Stevy 
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me 
Stop being greedy, ya heard what I said 
Let me go, let me flow on my bed 

Chorus(2x) 

I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap 
A yo it's cold on this level cause it's twice as deep 
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on 
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb 
Shall I go on 
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery 
How is it I can live and make history 
If you don't see it then it, wasn't ment for you to see 
If you wasn't born wit' it then, it wasn't ment for you to be 
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound 
lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled 
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key 
but can't be worst than the curse that was given ta me 
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone 
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong 
and that ain't right 
Just keep it fair baby 
Put me in the year, and I'll take it there baby 
Yes 

Chorus(2x) 

I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped 
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap 
Give me death but you ain't my friend 
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end 
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told 
that you would go, when you were old 
and if you died young, it was told 
So what the dilly, what it was worth 
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth 
What if it was a miscarriage and I never existed 
Have I given something that have been taken away you 
would of missed it 
Didn't know, did I persisted ? 
It was the call of the wild 
I'm here to say what's in my heart, and you call it a style 
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it 
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is eat it 
Another song completed is another thought captured 
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit 

Chorus(2x) 

Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath 
I'ma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day 
Where my niggaz ? 
(3x)Uh ha ha, for my niggaz
