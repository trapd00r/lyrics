Nobody's waiting for you 
get nothing for nothing 
pay the 
price and learn 
from your mistakes 
Insert your coin 
you gotta play 
the life game 
a million mother fuckers waiting for the next sucker 

Load 
and reload 
don't get nothing for love 
life is a lesson. Make the 
revolution turn

you go round and around. you go round you go 

farther, cause everything is money 
but you know how to get away 
never forget your true colors 
true colors light your way 

Nobody cares about you 
slave to the system 
in a plastic existence 
greed that you don't need 

Insert your coin 
you gotta play the life game 
a million 
mother fuckers waiting for the next sucker 

Load and reload 
you know 
money talks 
learn your lesson. Save your mind and save your soul 
you go round and around, and around you go 

farther, cause everything is money 
but you know how to get away 
never forget your true colors 
true colors light your way 

You gotta play the life, 
you gotta play the life game (x3)

farther, cause everything is money 
and you know how to get away 
never forget your true colors 
true colors light your way 

everything is money 
and your heart needs another place 
never forget your true colors 
true colors light your way 
true colors light your way
