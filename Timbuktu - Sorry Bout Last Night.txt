Last night I went trippin' out with someone new
Headin' straight to where I knew you'd be
So c'mon baby tell me what it did to you
When you saw that stranger kissin' me 

You ain't gonna treat me
Like no alley cat
And if I broke your heart last night
Sorry 'bout that 

You keep tellin' me that you don't care no more
Like you're the only joker in the deck
Well I'd just like to know what you were shakin' for
When he put his arms around my neck


And you ain't gonna treat me
Like no alley cat
And if I broke your heart last night
Gee, I'm sorry 'bout that 

And you tell me my motor just ain't runnin' right
He tells me I'm pretty well equipped
So baby tell me why your face kept turnin' white
Every time I sent him on a trip 

I'm tired of bein' treated, yeah
Like your alley cat
So if I broke your heart last night
You know how sorry I am about that

If there's anything I can't stand to see is a grown man cry. Poor baby.
