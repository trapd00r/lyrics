Send "I Don't Need Your Love Song" Ringtone to your Cell I can´t be myself around you
Always seem to nag and be cruel
When they said that we would soon fall apart 
They were right from the very start
No more energy, just let me be
It´s not worth what you got
So I´ll call this thing, just a stupid fling
Let´s delete and rewind

(Chorus)
I don´t need your love song
Oh no, oh no, no more
I don´t need your love song
Oh no, oh no, no more

Should have know that we were doomed
When you asked to be my groom
After loosing all in a poker bet
I guess you hoped, that I would forget

So I stayed to long with Mr. Wrong
Wishing he would be right
But when do one night stands 
leed to wedding plans
Let´s delete and rewind

(Chorus)

I don´t need it, I don´t need it
I don´t need no more love songs
I don´t need it, no, I don´t need it, no
Don´t need more love songs

Sleepless nights
Countless fights
I´m tired of cries, and lies
I don´t need your love song 
no no no
I don´t need your love song
oh - no, no no no

(Chorus x 2)

I don´t need it, I don´t need it
I don´t need no more love songs
I don´t need it, no, I don´t need it, no
Don´t need more love songs

I can´t sing your love song
No more x 4
