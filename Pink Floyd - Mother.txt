Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like the song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Mother, should I build a wall?

Mother, should I run for President?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mamma, will they put me in firing line?
Is it just a waste of time?

Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mother's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here under her wing

She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cozy and warm
Ooh babe, ooh baby, ooh babe
Of course mother's gonna help build the wall

Momma, do you think she's good enough, for me?
Momma, do you think she's dangerous, to me?
Momma, will she tear your little boy apart?
Mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mamma's going to check out all your girlfriends for you
And mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you come in

And mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Ooh babe, ooh baby, ooh babe
You'll always be baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high?
