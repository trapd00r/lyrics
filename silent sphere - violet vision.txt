Send "Center" Ringtone to your Cell Feel nothing
Oxen and primate as one
Pushing what already strives
(There is) no space
(There is) no peace
Let go of the whip

We've reached the outer limits of this orchestrated vision
Some might think it can't be kept apart
Forgot to ask: where are we in all of this?
Trying to get off track ... Into the wilderniss
Running from the beast

In need of strength, in search of guidance
Asked but given nothing - remembering everything
It matters not now, it all came to fuel
Silent growth
Hoarse rust
Can not be broken
I trust the shapes
Heathen vertigo
Repaint the curses and bellow
Sailing past to old shores
In the distant haze

The waving motion
Is not for you

In every direction stretched and torn no more
(It) seems we've been here all along
