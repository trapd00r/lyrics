Boy you reminded me of putting these things into words
And save them, for a rainy day
Your shameful heart and sinful soul
Oh, I'm amazed by you and all that you are

Your devious ways, you do the work of the dark forces in this world
And you're evil, oh yes you are 

CHORUS:
Damned, you're one man I just can't stand you're
Damned, you built your castle on the sand, you're
Damned, How could I ever want you for my man?
I've lost you now, so why do I care?

You really knew right from the start
How to work your way into my heart
And then you pulled the trigger, you shot me around the weakest (part)
You're a disgrace to the human race with your pretty face

Your devious ways, you do the work of the dark forces in this world
And you're evil, oh yes you are 

Damned, you're one man I just can't stand you're
Damned, you built your castle on the sand, you're
Damned, How could I ever want you for my man?
I've lost you now, so why do I care?

Your devious ways, you do the work of the dark forces in the world
And you're evil, oh yes you are 

Damned, you're one man I just can't stand you're
Damned, you built your castle on the sand, you're
Damned, How could I ever want you for my man?
I've lost you now, so why do I care? (Why do I care?)

Damned, you're one man I just can't stand you're
Damned, you built your castle on the sand, you're
Damned, How could I ever want you for my man?
I've lost you now, so why do I care? 

Damned - So why do I care?
