J-LO!

It's a new generation
Mr. Worldwide
Up for all you people

Darling get on the floor
Darling get on the floor

Let me introduce you to my party people
In the club... huh

[Pitbull]
I'm loose
And everybody knows I get off the train
Baby it's the truth
I'm like Inception I play with your brain
So I don't sleep I snooze
I don't play no games so don't get it confused no
Cos you will lose yeah
Now pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck

[Jennifer Lopez]
If you go hard you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak then step on the floor
If your an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah we work on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving
Put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running sh*t tonight on the floor
Brazil Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York
Vegas to Africa

[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Live your life ,and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
