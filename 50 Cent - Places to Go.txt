Yeah
Shady...
Aftermath....
G-UNIT!!

I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warning you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in ya, hole in ya
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in ya, hole in ya

You mistaken me for somebody that you should be testin'
You should be stressin', I'm finna' fucking teach you a lesson
Rap 101's in session, Em laced the track that I'm blessin
Smith and Wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin', escape lesson
Caps in my benz, I'm beginning to end
Watch the 22 spin, My hoes a perfect ten
I got shot but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win but tend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best don't you get it, forget it, when I spit it it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's shady
Aftermath in your ass bitch!
If it's not a classic, when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered
Stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard
When messes get drastic
Crock's made out of plastic
Cock and aim it blast it!
Run nigga, now stash shit!

I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warning you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in ya, hole in ya
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in ya, hole in ya

If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
Imma drink til I get to that bitch
Em and Dre gonna Introduce me to the burbs, they gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit ?Break it down!

Picture a perfect picture
Picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me starting shit
Picture me busting my gat
Picture police mad dey ain't got a picture of that
Picture me being broke
Picture me smoking them stacks
Picture me coming up
Picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowing up
Now picture me going back
To my momma basement to live, shit
Picture that!
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch yo' pact
You wear a vest without gat, you's a target jack
Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back
50 cent, too much henny, man I'm bent, I'm outta here!

I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warning you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in ya, hole in ya
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in ya, hole in ya

Ha ha, man I aint' going to jail, not even to visit a nigga
You wanna holla at me, you write me
Matta fact, you gotta send it to Sunset Blvd up in the Montreal
Riding around in one of Dre's Ferrari's nigga
Oh matter fact, I might be in Detroit, riding around 8 mile road
You know, in one of Em's joints and shit, ya heard
I got places to go man, ya know
Shady aftermath, we finished the printin' of money, ha ha ha
Putting our faces on these motherfuckin' bills, shit, ha ha ha ha
