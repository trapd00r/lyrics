Tell me something else
Tell me that you will change
Tell me something else
Donât repeat again
Tell me something new
Say another tune
Show me something else
Another side of you

Did u never think that I might go
Did u never thing I might not take it any more..

Sow me something else
Sow some grace
âCause I cant base no love
On the beauty of u face
Convince me in away
So we survive
Show me another u
Show me another side

Did you never thinkâ¦

Tell me something else
Tell me that you will change
Tell me something new
Donât repeat again
Tell me something else
Say another tune
I canât wait no more
Waiting by the door..
