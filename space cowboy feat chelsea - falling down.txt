Send "Falling Down (feat. Chelsea)" Ringtone to your Cell Down down down down down
Everbody falling
Down down down down down
And they fallin'

Cherry Cherry Boom Boom
Red One
Space Cowboy

I close my eyes
I put my back against the wall
Put my glasses on
And I don't see no one at all
I'm in my own world
And all that I can see is
Girls girls girls
In the club dem a rollin'
Boys boys boys
At the bar them a ballin'
Poppin' champagne until the early mornin'
2am then a cab them are callin'
To the next spot where they drop and they falllin'

Down down down down down
Everbody falling
Down down down down down
And they fallin'
Down down down down down
Everbody falling
Down down down down down
And they fallin'

This is my life
And people try to shut me down
Put my music on
And those people don't make a sound

I'm in my own world
And all that I can see is
Girls girls girls
In the clothes them are wearin'
Boys boys boys
At the bar them are starin'
Every hot girl on the floor on them are tearin'
On the dance floor while the dj's spinnin'
Lining up the shots 'til they drop and they fallin'

Down down down down down
Everbody falling
Down down down down down
And they fallin'
Down down down down down
Everbody falling
Down down down down down
And they fallin'

Down down dee down down down down down down Down down dee down down down down

Follow me lets go downtown
Follow me follow me

Let's go
We're so robotic, electronic, melodic, exotic
We like to party with Bacardi then we dance erotic
And we're out here on the dance floor havin' fun
And we ain't stopping We keep dropping 'til we see the sun

Up comes the sun
Up comes the sun
Up comes the sun
Up comes the sun

Down down down down down
Everybody falling
Down down down down down
Everybody's falling
Down down down down down
Everybody falling
Down down down down down
And they falling down
