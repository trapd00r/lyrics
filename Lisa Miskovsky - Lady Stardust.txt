Stardust, lady Stardust spread your hair across your universe of magic,
let us in
Let's find it to the Milky way and climb these concret walls
And say don't ever close us in

Like every city needs a distance, every sky demands a moon
Every winter needs a snowfall, every summer wants a June
Money's just a piece of paper, gold is blinding don't you see
Fame is just our own illusion of what life was meant to be
But I don't need a perfect mirror, I don't care for queens and kings
We are free and we are perfect when Lady Stardust sings

Play on, play on, play on, play on, play on, oh Lady Stardust sing
Play on, play on, play on, play on, play on, oh Lady Stardust sing

Stardust, lady Stardust let us cruise around your universe of magic,
I am in
Lets play this song and on and on and on an on 'til the dawn
And never let them win

And every minute needs the hour, every day demands a night
Every giant supernova, it's the city with your light
Moviestars and grand directors, silver screens and Mtv:s
Gods and angels all around me fills the air like little bees
I don't need no superheroes, I don't care for Gods with wings
I hear teardrops on the pavement when Lady Stardust sings

Play on, play on, play on, play on, play on, oh Lady Stardust sing
Play on, play on, play on, play on, play on, Lady Stardust sing

I don't need no superheroes, I don't care for Gods with wings
I hear teardrops on the pavement when Lady Stardust sing
Lady stardust sing (nanana) she sings (nanana) sing for you
I sing this song so please hold on, I sing this song for you
And say something that matters, and say something that matters
Try to say something that matters to you, so please hold on
Try to say something that matters
