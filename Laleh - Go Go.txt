The steps that we take 
The steps that we take
The steps that we take
The steps that we take

well I’m lost in the drums
and I’m lost in the base
and I’m lost in the girl with a cute face
And I loose my self in the drums that i play
and I play like I play for the beauty of your face
and I know, I know
I know what I know
you wont believe me if I say so
If you for a while could see what I see in you girl
Cant she tell, cant she tell?
If you see you’re even more beautiful then

Go go, go
All we need Is some rhythm to dare
1, 2, 3 let me lay out the rhythm of the steps that   we take

Go go, go
all we need Is some rhythm to dare
1, 2, 3 let me lay out the rhythm of the steps that   we take

The steps that we take.
The steps that we take.

We’ve been lost too long
we’ve been lost in the blaze
But its never to late
to walk away
and what are the choices
realise and stay and
realise her faith go down with the plain
and whats new whats old
o lend me hope
say you wont be the one without control
let it happen girl
let it happen let go, go

Cant she tell, cant she tell?
If you see you’re even more beautiful then
If you could see what i see girl
Cant she tell, cant she tell?
If you see you’re even more beautiful then

Go go, go
all we need Is some rhythm to dare
1, 2, 3 let me lay out the rhythm of the steps that    we take

Go go, go
all we need Is some rhythm to dare
1, 2, 3 let me lay out the rhythm of the steps that   we take

The steps that we take.
The steps that we take.
The steps that we take.
The steps that we take.
