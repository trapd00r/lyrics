Pink:
Put me on the table
Make me say your name
If I can't remember
Then give me all your pain
I can sit and listen
Or I can make you scream
Kiss it and make it better
Just put your trust in me

Oh my God, go a little slower
Oh my God, what was that again
L da da, let me feel you baby
Let me in, 'cause I understand
Let me feel you baby
'Cause I understand

Peaches:
I understand all
Now climb my sugar walls
Problem solved it's dissolved 
with the solvent known as spit
Lickity lick not too quick it's a
Slick ride make my mink slide
'Cause we're all pink inside

Pink:
This can be really easy
It doesn't have to be hard
Here baby let me show you
I'll have ya, climbing up the walls
You got all the problems (you got all the problems)
I think that I can solve (I'll be your therapy)
Why don't you come in here baby
Why don't we sit and talk

Oh my God, go a little slower
Oh my God, what was that again
L da da, let me feel you baby
Let me in, 'cause I understand
Let me feel you baby
'Cause I understand

Peaches:
You like the top and the bottom
You made a drop and then caught 'em
And when you rock then you've got 'em
Oh my God 'em oh my God 'em

Pink:
Let me feel you baby
'Cause I understand

Peaches:
You like the top and the bottom
You made a drop and then caught 'em
And when you rock then you've got 'em
Oh my God 'em oh my God 'em

Pink:
Let me feel you baby
'Cause I understand

Peaches:
I understand
Now lemme show you where to put that hand
My little red engine says

Pink: 
I think I can I think I can

Peaches:
I got your coochy-coo
how 'bout you?

Pink:
I got your coochy-coo too
