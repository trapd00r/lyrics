Days like this to me senses
I see to the old buried losts
Golden times are when I remember
How I used to talk to my heart
Seems to be easy now
Whenever I need to cry, I hide
It's too late to get back
Looking for over frown tracks

I'll see you in another world
I'll see you in another world

In this soul of the streets
We walked on
The magic reads
From it's old histories
Among all the people
I've never seen before,
It's the ghost of you
That I'm looking for

Seems to be all set up 
Whenever I think of you
I give up
It's too late to get back
Looking for overgrown tracks

I'll see you in another world
I'll see you in another world
