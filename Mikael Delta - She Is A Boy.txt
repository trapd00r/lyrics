Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they ha?
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all will understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the...
Chi-town what's going on

[Chorus:]
Through the wire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come what may
For one chance to be with you, I take it all the way
Right down through the fire, even through the wire

[Verse 1:]
I drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry ya'll Mr. H to tha izzos back to wizzerk How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them Dynasty signs
Ain't no use tryna be lyin'
I been tryna signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where biggie smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

[Chorus]

I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstruct....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
Im still here for yall right now man
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

[Verse 2:]
What if somebody from the Chi was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Cept' he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wanna sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe; safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
It was telivised
All they heard was that I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought they called me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus]

Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on
She can't be serious man

[Chorus repeats till fade]
