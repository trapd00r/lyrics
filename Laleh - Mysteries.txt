I remember what we said
I believe in better times ahead
There’s so much unpredicted

I believed in turning trees
how they twist and tingle after light
I believed in turning it all around
overnight

and I do, I do my best not to care
that you still make me blush
if you don’t love me, love,
then love me such
I do my best not to care
that you still make me blush
and if you do love me, love
then love me such

and if you do love me
then love me such

I believe in fairy-tales
I believe in so much more ahead
I believed in turning times
I believe I could be one of them
no matter the beginning
happy in the end
I wont spend a minute no more
I wont spend another second less
so goodbye long ago bitterness
And then I loose all hope and just
let go,
No - don’t let go all is unpredictable
unpredictable

I do my best not to care
that you still make me blush
and if you do love me, love
then love me such
do my best not to care
that you still make me blush
and if you don’t love me love
so help me God

No - don’t let go all is unpredictable
If you do love me, love, then love
me such.
