(Lalalala, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You may talk, you may walk
But don't start any trouble kid
You don't mess, with the best
So don't question the way you live

Have a cookie and some television
Stay put until the next collision
They're your voice, so believe
You've no choice but to deal with it

Here come the big guns
Speaking for all the young ones
They make the world go round
You better abide just step aside 
Cause here come the big guns
The gentlemen with the sharp tongues
Heads high my young allies
Make some noise now 
Raise your voice and scream

(Lalalala, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Take the fame, not the blame
Have no shame, mr know it all's
Is it fair, will you care
Or be there if disaster calls

Same story but a new ambition
Another month another manic mission
Just relax, matter fact
Get on back to the drawing board

Here come the big guns
Speaking for all the young ones
They make the world go round
You better abide just step aside 
Cause here come the big guns
The gentlemen with the sharp tongues
Heads high my young allies
Make some noise now 
Raise your voice and scream

(Oh yeah!)

What do you know man
Get with the program
The real truth's coming from the youth
Check what I'm singing
Respect our opinion
Pie in the sky
We don't have that anymore

You better abide just step aside
Cause here come the big guns
Speaking for all the young ones
They make the world go round
You better abide just step aside 
Cause here come the big guns
The gentlemen with the sharp tongues
Heads high my young allies
Make some, noise now 
Make some noise now 
Raise your voice and scream
