Ooh,
No, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no,
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh,

Just past eleven o'clock,
Roll up in the club,
Wanna rock the spot (uh-oh),
Girls out to bubble it up,
Boys take a look, see what you can't touch (uh-oh),

Seven jeans and a Prada bag,
Six inch heels - how you likin' that?
Working it out, he's checking it out,
I'm knockin' him down round after round,

I can feel the bassline jumping,
Watch out there's my song,

Ladies, let me see your hands up in the air,
Ladies, show 'em what ya got,
Shake it all around, yeah, yeah,
Oh, you want a little of this,
You want a little, want a little of this,
Hey yo, you want a little of this,
You want a little, want a little of this,
Once you think you think you've got it,
Can't, can't, can't, can't touch it,

Ooh oh,
I'm not what you think I am,
You ain't gonna get what you think you can (uh-oh),
Oh no, you ain't the man,
You might be fine, but I don't give a damn (uh-oh),
'Cause I'm here with my girls tonight,
No strings attached, no guys required,
Gonna let my hair down, get out of the town,
DJ turn it up nice and loud,

I can feel the bassline jumping,
Watch out there's my song,

Ladies, let me see your hands up in the air,
Ladies, show 'em what ya got,
Shake it all around, yeah, yeah,
Oh, you want a little of this (come on),
You want a little, want a little of this (yeah, yeah),
Hey yo, you want a little of this,
You want a little, want a little of this,
Once you think you think you've got it,
Can't, can't, can't, can't touch it,

You want a little of this, you want a little,
Want a little of this (ooh, hey, hey)
You want a little of this, you want a little,
Want a little of this (yeah, yeah, you want a little of this),

I can feel the bassline jumping,
Watch out there's my song (ooh),

Ladies, let me see your hands up in the air (up in the air),
Ladies, show 'em what ya got,
Shake it all around, yeah, yeah,
Oh, you want a little of this (do you want it?),
You want a little, want a little of this,
Hey yo, you want a little of this,
You want a little, want a little of this (now, now, now, now),
Once you think you think you've got it,
Can't, can't, can't, can't touch it,

Ladies, let me see your hands up in the air,
Ladies, show 'em what ya got,
Shake it all around, yeah, yeah, (you want a little of this),
Oh, you wanna little of this,
You want a little, want a little of this (yeah),
Hey yo, you want a little of this (want a little of this),
You want a little, want a little of this,
Once you think you think you've got it,
Can't, can't, can't, can't touch it.
