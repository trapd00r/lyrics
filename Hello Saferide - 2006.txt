Party favours on the floor and a
Half drunk bottle with a popcorn in it
Yesterday's dress in a complete mess and a
Bruise on my arm, I don't know how I got it
January 1st and it's already clear:
It's gonna be another shitty year

This years resolutions:
I will exercise more
Call my grandma
Tell my family that I love them
Learn more about the world wars, and forget
I will learn a new word each day
Today's word is dejected

And on the top of the list there's you
I'm going to be with you
I haven't told you yet but I'm going to be with you

Aaaah

Doorbell's ringing, I ordered pizza
Came half through it, wish I hadn't eaten so much, had some more
Watching Ivanhoe on TV,
Picturing me as slacker Marion
Wished for a life this year, it's brand new
but on the top of the list there's you
I'm going to be with you
I haven't told you yet but I'm going to be with you
