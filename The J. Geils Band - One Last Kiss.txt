Just one last kiss
Before I walk out the door
I'm gonna hold you tighter
Than I ever did before

And I, I never promised you
The things you promised me
And I, I can't justify
The way it's gotta be

(CHORUS)
And the good times are the best times
The bad times fade away
The good times are forever
But now, baby, the last time is today

Just one more night
There's no time for anymore
I'm gonna tell you something
That you've never heard before

But I, I can't find the words
To ease your lovers pain
And I, I know the feeling's gone
I can feel it in my veins

(CHORUS)

One last kiss

(CHORUS)

One last kiss
