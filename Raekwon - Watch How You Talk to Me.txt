Send "Are You Talking to Me???" Ringtone to your Cell I got a little story to tell you guys here
It starts like this
I go to this bar
Actually it's not a bar, it's more like a club
Like the Pelican on 23rd Street or something
You know, the Pelican, it's a nice place, but in this case
We're not talking about the Pelican

Well, I walk in
And there's this guy
And he's talking
And you know who he's talking to?
He's talking to me
The problem is
I can't make out what he's saying
He goes like this
And he goes like that
But he doesn't seem to get anywhere
Still… He must be talking to me

(Chorus)
Are you talking to me?
I can see no one else 'round here
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
I can see no one else 'round here
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me? 

Now, looking at the eyes of the fellow
I slowly seem to realize
He's eying this girl on the dance floor
And that's actually mine
Lovely Rita, lovely Chika
It's my girl he's after
That's his aim, that's his game

He's going nagedinag, he goes ragidirag
He goes flipfloppyto and “How about you?”
But what he wants – I can't make out
He's little sense, he's only sound
This is my place, this is my bar, it's my girl
Get the motherfucking shit out
Wanna get my in a situation?
That's what you want?

Chorus x3

I can't see your silly face
And I don't know what you're after
And I don't think it's right
I don't think it's just
I don't think it's what people should do
You shouldn't be standing here in front of me
Talking to me
Some sense I don't understand
Some nonsense - some bullshit
And looking at my girl on the dance floor all the time
So I'm asking myself
What should I do to you?
I got this little thing that happened to me once
There was this guy
And he'd always come up to people
And he was just standing
And he would be bragging about this
He got knocked out
I don't know what happened to him after that
No one ever saw him again

Something bad is gonna happen
Something sad is gonna happen

Yeah, you've gone for some trouble man

Chorus x2

Ohhhh
Heeey

And this guy is getting on my nerves
When he's coming up like that - look at him!
What's he wearing?
He's got his oversized t-shirt
He's got his oversized baggy-pants
Everything is too big on him

He's looking like - I don't know

"What do you do for a living? The garbage man?"
"Yes!"
