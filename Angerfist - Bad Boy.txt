Send "Bad Boy" Ringtone to your Cell All the people down the street, whoever you meet
Say I'm a bad boy, say I'm a bad boy
Say I'm a bad boy
Even dear old dad, when he gets mad
Says I'm a bad boy, says I'm a bad boy
Says I'm a bad boy
Well, you see now, I got a girl
And we stay out late, almost every night
Well, the people just stare and they declare
Well well, it just ain't right
But if only they knew how I love you
They'd say a bad boy, could be a good boy
Who's just in love

Well, you see now, I got a girl
And we stay out late, almost every night
Well, the people just stare and they declare
Well well, it just ain't right
But if only they knew how I love you
They'd say a bad boy, could be a good boy
Who's just in love
So much in love
So crazy in love
So much in love
