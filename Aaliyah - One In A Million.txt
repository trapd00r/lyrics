Baby, you don't know what you do to me
Between me and you, I feel a chemistry
I won't let no one come and take your place
'Cause the love you give can't be replaced
See, no one else love me like you do
That's why I don't mind to spend my life wit'chu
Wanna please you in any way I can
I wanna share my world, don't you understand?

Your love is a one in a million, it goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million, it goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

Turn me inside out, make my heart speak
Need no one else, you are all I need
Personality(ty) in everything you do (do)
Makes me love everything 'bout you
Your smile, your style, so fly, I can't deny
I got a crush on you, and that's true indeed
And I'm diggin' you, you make me believe

That your love is a one in a million, it goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million, it goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

I'll give you anything you want from me, anything you want, anything you need, anything your soul desires
I'll give you anything you want from me, anything you want, anything you need, anything your soul desires (anything 'cause)

Your love is a one in a million, it goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long (you give me, baby, yeah-ee-yeah)
Your love is a one (your love) in a million, it goes on and on and on
