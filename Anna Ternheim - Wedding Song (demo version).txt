( To be gone EP )

Not the first time I saw you
But I knew I want to spend some time
Half a day then a half a life time pass by
Until now, I never knew for who
For you my dear, promises I made, 
I made for you my dear
As close as one can get
I got to you my dear, then you should know
I won't let you down this time, 
I won't let you down this time.

This is our time for all times starting from today
Oh he takes her to the sky they say, 
She puts him on his feet again
There were bad times, never been so lonely
Beeing at house that time, you just let me go
We try to scream, words ran out like sand 
Now we talk again, it's better, and you should know

I won't let you down this time no no
I won't let you down this time

I won't let you down 
No I won't let you down
