Well Jimmy moved in with his mother
Cuz he ain't got no place to go

(Eminem)
And now I'm right back in the gutter 
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes 

(Future)
Cuz you live at home in a trailer 
What the hell u gonna do?

(Eminem)
Cuz I live at home in a trailer 
Mom I'm coming home to you

Well my names jimmy and his names Greg Buel 
And me him n u went to the same school.  
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage, he tappin my mom 
Were almost the same age 
On the microphone I drop bombs 
Look at this car, thanks a lot moms!
"Here happy birthday rabbit 
Here's a brand new car, u can have it"
a 1928 delta. this shit wont even get me to the shelter. 
And I cant even stand for a motel.
Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now

Cuz I live at home in a trailer,
Mom I'm comin' home to you...
