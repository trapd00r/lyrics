I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
I've been meaning to phone you, but from Minnesota
Hell, it's been a very long time

You wear it well
A little old-fashioned, but that's all right

Well, I suppose you're thinking, I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Though I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know

That you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine, oh, my

Remember their basement parties, your brothers' karate
The all-day rock 'n' roll shows?
The homesick blues and the radical views
Haven't left a mark on you

You wear it well
A little outta time, but I don't mind

But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even trying
Now I'm eating my heart out
Trying to get a letter through

Since you've been gone, it's hard to carry on

I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
And you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it didn't cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire

And you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you, no, no

Anyway, my coffee is cold, and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh

And I'll wear it well
I don't object if you call collect

'Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even trying
Now I'm eating my heart out
Trying to get back to you

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh, yeah

After all this, oh, it's the same address

Since you've been gone, it's hard to carry on, oh, no
