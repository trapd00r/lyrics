There go the street lights - the night's officially on,
I got the green light - to do what ever I want,
I'm gonna stand - outside - the box - and put the rules on hold,

Tonight Carte blanche first class for the evening

Ready Set Go

All the girls steppin' out for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)

Hey baby, I see you lookin' over here baby
Are you gonna keep lookin' - or get up?
And talk to me
Here's an opportunity that you don't wanna miss

Tonight Carte blanche first class for the evening

Ready Set Go

All the girls steppin' out for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)

Ohh Ohh

Do what you wanna do, tonight the world does not exist
no no no
Move how you want to move, all my girls work it out - like this

Give me room to shake, shake, shake, shake

All the girls steppin' out for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)

All girls for a public affair
(All night, let's rock cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, cause the party don't stop)
