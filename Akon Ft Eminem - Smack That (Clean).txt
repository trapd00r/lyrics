[Akon:]
Konvict. Upfront.
Akon. Slim Shady.
I see the one. Could she be that lady?
Oh!

[Akon:]
I feel you creepin' I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallado
Maybe go to my place & just kick it like Tae-Bo
& possibly bend you over look back & watch me Smack That
All on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'til you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Smack That all on the flow
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'til you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

[Akon:]
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parkin' lot slow with the lack down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club the wardrobe intact now!
I feel it on & crack now (oh)
I see it all that back now
I'm a call her, than I'll put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!
I feel you creepin' I can see it from my shadow
Why not jump up in my Lamborghini Gallado
Maybe go to my place & just kick it like tae bo
& possibly bend you over look back & watch me Smack That
All on the flow
Smack That give me some more
Smack That 'til you get sore
Smack That oh-oooh!
Smack That all on the flow
Smack That give me some more
Smack That 'til you get sore
Smack That oh-oooh!

Looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a little drink on
They goin' flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure manicure kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up & down them poles
Lookin' like one of them putty cat dolls
Tryin' to hold my woody back through my draws
Steps offstage didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me & she's like "your!..."
I'm like I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the cribs like a mile away
Or more like a palace shall I say
& plus I got a pal if your girl is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing
"Akon!"

[ Akon: ]
I feel you creepin' I can see it from my shadow

Smack That 'til you get sore
Smack That oh-oooh!

[Akon:]
Eminem's rollin' D & them rollin'
Ooh marvelous & all them rollin'
Women just hoin' big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be on them & goin "D!"
Hittin' no less than "3!"
Block will style like "Whee!"
Girl I can tell you want me because lately
I feel you creepin'  I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallado
Maybe go to my place & just kick it like tae bo
& possibly bend you over look back & watch me Smack That
All on the floor
Smack That give me some more
Smack That 'til you get sore
Smack That oh-oooh!
