Lauryn Hill:
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Take it Slowly 
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Make you want me

Wyclef:
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake 
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake 
Jail bars ain't golden gates Those who fake, they break, 
When they meet their 400 pound mate 
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun 
In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse 
I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine 
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased 
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep 
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week. 
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad 
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit 
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist 
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends 
A born again hooligan only to be king again

Lauryn Hill:
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Take it Slowly 
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Make you want me

Lauryn Hill:
Yo, I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest 
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless 
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes 
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo 
Voo Doo, I can do what you do, easy
Belive me, frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees 
So while you're imitating Al Capone 
I'll be Nina Simone and defacating on your microphone

Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Take it Slowly 

You can't run away 
From these styles I got, 
Oh baby, hey baby 
Cause I got a lot, oh yeah 
And anywhere you go 
My whole crew's gonna know, 
Oh baby, hey baby 
You can't hide from the block, oh no

Pras:
Ready or not, refugees takin' over 
The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rasta 
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber 
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers 
Superfly true lies, do or die, 
Toss me high - only puff la, With my crew from lock high 
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay 
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes)

Lauryn Hill:
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Take it Slowly 
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide (Ay, yo, nobody move)
Gonna Find You 
And Make you want me

Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Take it Slowly 
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide 
Gonna Find You 
And Make you want me
