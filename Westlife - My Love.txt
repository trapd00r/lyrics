How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace,
When I'm standing taking every breath,
With you, ooohhh,
You're the only one who really knew me, 
At all.

Take a look at me now

Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up, they wanna let it go
But we're still trying

So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street just you and I
Just you and I

I'm never gonna say goodbye
Cos I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I

All over again

You'll find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
I'm flying without wings

Can't believe that I'm the fool again 
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know 
You never told me 
Can't believe that I'm the fool again 
And I who thought you were my friend 
How was I to know 
You never told me 

But if I let you go
I will never know
What my life would be
Holding you close to me
Will I ever see
You smiling back at me
How will I know
If I let you go

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through, reality
And my destitation, makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness, still another mile
I believe in angels, something good in everything I see
I believe in angels, when I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

An empty street 
An empty house 
A hole inside my heart 
I'm all alone 
The rooms are getting smaller 
I wonder how 
I wonder why 
I wonder where they are 
The days we had 
The songs we sang together 
Oh yeah 
And oh my love 
I'm holding on forever 
Reaching for a love that seems so far 

So I say a little prayer
Hope my dreams will take me there 
Where the skies are blue 
To see you once again my love 
Over seas from coast to coast 
Find the place I love the most 
Where the fields are green 
I see you once again, my love

To hold you in my arms 
To promise you my love 
To tell you from a far 
What I'm thinking of 
Reaching for the love that seems so far

So â€¦So I say a little prayer 
Hope my dreams will take me there 
Where the skies are blue 
To see you once again my love 
Over seas from coast to coast 
Find the place I love the most 
Where the fields are green 
To see you once again my love 
I say a little prayer 
Dreams will take me there 
Where the skies are blue 
To see you once again my love 
Over seas from coast to coast 
Find the place I love the most 
Where the fields are green 
I see you once again my love
