One more kiss, dear
One more sigh
Only this, dear
It's goodbye
For our love is such pain
And such pleasure 
And I'll treasure till I die
So for now, dear
Aurevoir, madame
But I'm how-d'ye, not farewell
For in time we may have a love's glory
Our love story to tell

Just as every autumn
Leaves fall from the tree
Tumble to the ground and die
So in the springtime
Like sweet memories
They will return as will I

Like the sun, dear
Upon high
We'll return, dear
To the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow goodbye

One more kiss, dear
One more sigh
Only this, dear
Is goodbye
For our love is such passion
Such pleasure
I'll treasure till I die
Like the sun, dear
Upon high
We'll return, dear
To the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow 
Until tomorrow goodbye
