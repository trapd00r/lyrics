Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms, 
I'm findin' it hard to believe 
We're in heaven

Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years,

There was only you and me,

We were young and wild and free

Now nothin' can take you away from me 
We've been down that road before 
But that's over now, 
You keep me comin' back for more 

Baby, you're all that I want 
When you're lyin' here in my arms, 
I'm findin' it hard to believe 
We're in heaven 

And love is all that I need, 
And I found it there in your heart 
It isn't too hard to see 
We're in heaven 

Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me 
Oh, there's lots that I could say 
But just hold me now, 
Cause our love will light the way 

Baby you're all that I want 
When you're lyin' here in my arms, 
I'm findin' it hard to believe 
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need, 
And I found it there in your heart 
It isn't too hard to see 
We're in heaven 

Now our dreams are comin' true, 
Through the good times and the bad, 
Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you 

We're in heaven 

And love is all that I need, 
And I found it there in your heart 
It isn't too hard to see 

We're in heaven

We're in heaven
