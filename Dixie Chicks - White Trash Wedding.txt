Chorus
You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
and you can't afford no ring

You finally took my hand
You finally took my hand
It took a nip of gin 
but you finally took my hand

Chorus

Mamma don't approve
Mamma don't approve
Daddy says he's the very best
And mamma don't approve

Chorus

Baby's on its way
Baby's on its way
Say I do and kiss me quick
'Cause baby's on its way

I shouldn't be wearing white and you can't afford no ring!
