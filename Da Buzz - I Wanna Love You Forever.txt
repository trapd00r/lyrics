There was a time, when we were in love
And we ran in the sand, trough the days and nights 
We looked in the sky, the sunset turnes over to a fullmoon descies 
The time of my life'. 
The hot summer nights are never forever
Oh how can it be that my love's still so strong 
I can not sleep, I'll allways remember
The look in your eyes when we said goodbye 

I wanna love you forever 
And tell you how much I care
I wanna hold on together
How can I show you that it's for real 
I wanna love you forever' 

You took my heart, you took it all.
How can I go on, oh now when I know. 
Still holding your hand, a whisper of love
I'll allways belive that our love can be true. 
The hot summer nights are never forever
Oh how can it be that my love's still so strong
I can not sleep, I'll allways remember
The look in your eyes when we said goodbye 

I wanna love 
I won't forget the nights we shared
And the love that we had I won't regret the things I said 
I wanna love you forever'.
