It's the ocean and me
We're the ones to be
I always fall asleep
Beside the sea

And we've got a certain way
How it wakes me everyday
I never know though
With what kind of wave

And you know about oceans
How brutaly it can rush
Drown you, or calmly cares
You with a gentle touch

Sometimes I bring my boat
When I believe it'll let me float
It's just that I'm so often
Returning soaked

The ocean has you
Has the waves of you
And i never felt a sea
So blue
