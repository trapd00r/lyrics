Send "Dark Forces" Ringtone to your Cell Wake up and stop dreaming
Your real nightmares have begun
Inside you hear them screaming
Dark force awakening now to haunt
They're riding like a desert storm
The demon will you call
Until the end of dawn
The dogs of hell reborn

Black magic in the air
My heart's full of despair
The evil out there
My blood smells everywhere

The dark forces of the night
In my dreams I hear them calling
The dark forces of the night
Killing me now --- killing me now
The dark forces of the night
Now my evil soul is burning
The dark forces of the night
Sacrifice my blood

The seventh sign is broken
My world will burn down and fall
Why has my God forsaken?
I sold my soul forevermore
With evil I have signed a deal
Salvation for my sin
This is my last desire
From the demons and the fire
