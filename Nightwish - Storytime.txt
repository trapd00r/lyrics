It was the night before,
When all through the world,
No words, no dreams, then one dayâ€¦

A writer by a fire,
Imagined all Gaia,
Took a journey into a child-man's heart.

A painter on the shore,
Imagined all the world,
Within a snowflake on his palm.

Unframed by poetry,
A canvas of awe,
Planet Earth falling back into the stars.

I am the voice of Never Never Land,
The innocence, the dreams of every man.
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky.
Every chimney, every moonlit sight,
I am the story that will read you real.
Every memory that you hold dear.

I am the journey,
I am the destination.
I am the home,
The tale that reads you.

A way to taste the night,
The elusive high.
Follow the madness,
Alice, you know once did.

Imaginaerum,
A dream emporium.
Caress the tales,
And they will dream you real.

A storyteller's game,
Lips that intoxicate.
The core of all life is a
Limitless chest of tales.

I am the voice of Never Never Land,
The innocence, the dreams of every man.
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky.
Every chimney, every moonlit sight,
I am the story that will read you real.
Every memory that you hold dear.

I am the voice of Never Never Land,
The innocence, the dreams of every man.
Searching heavens for another Earth.

Neverland! Innocence! Dreams of every man!
Neverland! Innocence! Every man! Peter Pan!

I am the voice of Never Never Land,
The innocence, the dreams of every man.
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky.
Every chimney, every moonlit sight,
I am the story that will read you real.
Every memory that you hold dear.
