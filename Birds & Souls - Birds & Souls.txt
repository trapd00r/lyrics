Send "Severed Soul" Ringtone to your Cell I am a child without you near
My strongest love reduced to fear
For when you’re gone I’m a severed soul
My poor heart bleeds from a gaping hole

Love please don’t leave me evermore
With you I see what life is for
If you should go where would I be
There’d be no joy in life for me

Lord lift me up from this cold earth
Let judgment day declare my worth
For if my love should not want me
By death alone would I be free
