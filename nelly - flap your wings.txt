It's summertime, and I'm back again 
And went to VA, oh, got my friends 
Say what's up, Pharrell 

(Pharrell) 
Look whats on the nail 

Yeah but, let's show 'em what's above the nail, bling 
A hundred thou couldn't get you one of these (Not one of these) 
I guarantee it ain't a flaw on one of these (One of these) 
Two hundred thou, couldn't get you in the league 
Get three hundred thou, you couldn't even buy the keys 
I think you need to add 50 more G's 
Now, shall I proceed? 

(Ladies) 
Yes, indeed (Ho) 

I need to see you take it down to the floor 
Spread your wings, if you real ma, fly real low 
Pause for a second ma, grind real slow 
And if you do it right 
All day we'll go (Ho) 
I talk a lil' Fred Seigal girl (Seigal, girl) 
Bonnie and Judy Lee with your bag all beaded, girl 
Apple bottom pair underneath it 
You talkin like you don't need it 
I can tell you see it 
I like that in you 
I don't see nothin wrong 
Drop down and get your eagle on (Woah)

OPP time, now let's get naughty 
You take babygirl, and I'ma take shorty 
With the sweat drippin all over her body 
We gone move if you wanna (Oh) 
Groove if you wanna (Oh) 
Throw your nose up ma, and get rude if you wanna 
Ain't got nothin to lose, nor to prove 
Babygirl soaked like she just got out of the pool (Eh) 
I know you're thirsty ma 
Go ahead and order whatchu want 
Some call it trickin, go ahead and call it whatchu want 
I came to ball, I ain't come out here to front 
Cause the black card will pick-up what the grey card wont 
Attractiveness 
Got me attackin this 
I'm so fabulous 
Glutious maximus 
She wanna fly south for the winter (For the winter) 
I might just go down south just to win her (Just to win her) 
Hell naw, she ain't gone leave me alone 
Makin plans for us to be at home 
Take your pants off ma, you can leave your panties on 
But, first drop down and get your eagle on (Oh)
