Send "Sub Crazy" Ringtone to your Cell (Chorus) 

We can all get by if we want now 
Get a fat piece of the pie if we want 
Motherfuckers gettin' mad high when they want now 
I will survive, recognize it be Tical 

(---Method Man---) 

Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war on the ill block 
Things just ain't peace no more, fuck it 
If you ain't with me then forget me 
Niggas try to stick me, retaliation, no hesitation, shifty 
Creepin' niggas in the dark, triggas with no heart 
Rippin' ass apart, I'll be swimmin' with the sharks now 
Stay out my water or it's manslaughter 
Kid, you oughta start reachin' for that nickle-plated auto- 
Matic, my thoughts get sporadic, loaded raps 
Bustin' mad shots to ya attic 
They say this hazard, this flows a hazard 
Straight from Hazard County with a bounty on his head, and it said 
"Wanted Dead or Alive," I swear by the whites of they eyes 
To never take a dive I will survive 

(Chorus) 

Shit's gonna happen if niggas start actin' 
Like they want problems, you want 'em, you got 'em 
Rap contact, is writin' this exactly, the way it should be 
Attacked, Killer Beeeees on a swarm 
So what my martial law drops bombs like Qur'an 
The ism helps to stimulate my pugilism 
I bust rhymes like jizm, impregnate the rhythm with the wisdom 
Decipher the flow, I be hyper, I bring all the styles 
That rekindle like old flames 
Saliva, check the wicked flows I deliva 
Oops, I mean deliver like the Hudson River 
Styles be tight, trite like a thief in the night 
I be the sneaky-ass nigga bustin' nuts in yo wife 
Blasted, buggin' off Bacardi and acid 
Flippin' on the mic, it's a classic
