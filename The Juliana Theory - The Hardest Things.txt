they couldn't have told me, that it would be like this
that it could be like this, for you
i wish i would've known, that it could be like this
that it would be like this, for you

i know you're hurting
i know you're reaching out
i'm sure you wonder
what this is all about 
you could be spiteful
for whats been done to you
i'm sure you feel it
you know i feel it too

sometimes the hardest things in life 
are the things we have to do
and even when we feel its right
i never want to hurt you

its never simple
deciding what should be
theres still a void here
when you're an absentee
you could be angry 
but you're a bigger man
we know you'll make it
never forget to stand

sometimes the hardest things in life
are the things we have to do
and even when we feel its right
i never want to hurt you

you've always been
you always will
you've always been a part of me...
you'll always be a part of me

the hardest things in life 
are the things we have to do
and even when we feel its right
i never want to hurt you

sometimes the hardest things in life 
are the things we have to do
and even when we feel its right
i never want to hurt you
