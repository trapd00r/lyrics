(Intro) 
Baby I see you workin hard 
Wanna let you know that I'm proud 
Wanna let you know I admire what you do 
Don't Know if I need to reassure you 
My life would be purposeless without you 
If I want it (You Got It) 
If I ask you (You Provide It) 
You inspire me to be better (ooh) 
You challenge me for the better (ooh ooh) 
Sit back and let me pour out my love letter 

(Beyonce) 
Let me help you, take off your shoes 
Untie your shoe strings, take off your cuflinks 
What you wanna eat boo, Let me feed you 
Let me run your bath water 
Whatever you desire, I'll supply ya 
Sing you a song, turn the game on 
I'll brush your hair, help you put your do-rag on 
Wanna foot rub, want a manicure 
Baby I'm yours I wanna cater 2 u 

(Chorus) 
Let Me Cater 2 u 
Cause baby this is your day 
Do anything for my man 
Baby you blow me away 
I got your slippers, your dinner, your desert 
And so gidarijanha, anything you want 
Let me cater 2 u 

Inspire me from the heart 
Can't nothing tear us apart 
Your all I want in a man 
I put my life in your hands 
I got your slippers, your dinner, your desert 
And so gidarijanha, anything you want 
Let me cater 2 u

Makin sure your that I'm doing my part 
Boy is there something you need me to do

And whatever I'm not fulfillin 
Another woman is willing
