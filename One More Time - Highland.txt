Looking out and I'm wondering where I am
While I'm stuck in the daily traffic jam
I decide to get out and leave the car behind me
Everywhere there are people passing by
Empty faces and not a friendly smile
Under stress, loneliness, a part of our city
Now I finally have decided
I will leave it all behind
And discover something better
And l know where I will find
Find a place of harmony, of laughter and of dreams
It you want me, that is where I'll be

I'll be waiting on the Highland
With its wonderful serenity
Where the stars glow and the brooks flow
That's my way of life
When the mountains on the Highland
And the nature is surrounding me
When the wind blows
That's all I need, all I need

On the highland when I was a child
I would play with my friends and we were wild
And we all loved the moors, the nature and it's freedom
And we went for ghost hunt in the mist
I remember the first time I got kissed
By the shy neighbour guy, who whispered "be my girlfriend"
But I longed for some excitement
So I travelled 'round the world
After that I settled down and
I became a city girl
Went to parties every night and lived intensively
Now I know it's not a life for me

I'll be waiting on the Highland
With it's wonderful serenity
Where the stars glow and the brooks flow
That's my way of life
When the mountains on the Highland
And the nature is surrounding me
When the wind blows 
that's all I need
Bonnie Highland, Bonnie Highland, you're sweet

Oh my darling, I would hate to leave it without you
I'm sure you love the highland too

If you join me I can promise
You'll stay until eternity

I'll be waiting on the Highland
With it's wonderful serenity
Where the stars glow and the brooks flow
That's my way of life
When the mountains on the Highland
And the nature is surrounding me
When the wind blows 
that's all I need
Bonnie Highland

Bonnie highland

All the mountains on the highland are embracing
and surrounding me
