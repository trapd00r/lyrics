There's rain on my window,
And I'm thinking of you,
Tears on my pillow,
But I will come thru...

Josephine, I send you all my love,
And every single step I take
I take for you.

Josephine, I'll send you all my love,
Josephine, I'll send you all my love,

Now there's a stone on my radar,
But I can still fly.
You are the reason,
The blue in my sky.

Josephine, I'll send you all my love,
Josephine...

Life with a pain in,
I was walking away.
In the coldest of winter,
Night becomes day.

Josephine, I send you all my love,
And every single step I'll take
I take for you.

My Josephine, I send you all my love,
Josephine, I send you all my love,
I send you all my love,
Josephine, I send you all my love,
When I fall away, I send you all my love,
Josephine...
