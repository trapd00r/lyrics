Send "Living Legend" Ringtone to your Cell All I want is everything
Any less is the same old thing
So many know you well
And it never seems to stop
Don't I know it well
How you never want to stop

I can understand
I can run away
I can blow it off
To another day
If I had it all to give
I would give it all to you
If I had the world to give
You would have the world in your backyard

Competing living legends
They wake up and they strangle us
I hate the competition
From breathing living legends

Get that man out of my face
You make it seem like some kind of race
All I want is time with you
All you want is time with him
Why do you spend my time with you
Trying to spend your time with him

I can understand
I can run away
I can blow it off
Or let it fade away
If it wasn't there
You could be some kind of friend
Why is it always there
To be a friend is not that hard
