Maybe I want more of everything
of everything that you got
And maybe I want more than enough
of your love, your sweet sweet love
But come on and leave me
and run through the night
'cos even if it hurts - it's alright!
Yea, come on and leave me
and do what you like
'cos even if it hurts - it's alright!
Take what you want, take what you need
There's something I'll miss
but I won't let it show
'cos it's a girl that I used to know
A girl with a heart but it left long ago
So come on and leave me...
