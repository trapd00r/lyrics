Send "Still Number 1" Ringtone to your Cell My mother smoked crack I had a
premature birth

I’m just a nerve cursed with badly
disturbed nerves

You wanna be the one to step up
and get served first

99% of aliens prefer
earth

I come here to rule the planet,
starting with your turf

I hid a secret message inside of a
word search

With smeared letters runnin'
together in blurred spurts

I hang with male chauvinist pigs
and perverts

Who point water pistols at women
and squirt shirts

Been a bad boy since diapers and
Gerber's

My first words were bleep bleep and
curse curse

Never had it and I still don’t
deserve dirt

My breath still stinks and I’m on
my third cert

Yanking out my stitches, and hollering "nurse nurse,

You said this shot would numb it,
chick it just hurts worse!"
