Please don't stop the music (4x)

It's gettin late 
I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate (yeah)
Who knew 
That you'd be up in here lookin like you do 
You're makin' stayin' over here impossible 
Baby I must say your aura is incredible 
If you dont have to go don't

Do you know what you started 
I just came here to party 
But now we're rockin on the dancefloor 
Acting naughty 
Your hands around my waist 
Just let the music play 
We're hand in hand
Chest to chest 
And now we're face to face

I wanna take you away 
Lets escape into the music 
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it 
Like the way you do this 
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the music 
(Repeat)


Baby are you ready cause its getting close 
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode 
What goes on between us no one has to know 
This is a private show (oh)

Do you know what you started 
I just came here to party 
But now we're rockin on the dancefloor 
Acting naughty 
Your hands around my waist 
Just let the music play 
We're hand in hand
Chest to chest 
And now we're face to face

I wanna take you away 
Lets escape into the music 
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it 
Like the way you do this 
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the music 

Please don't stop the music (3x)

Ma ma se, ma ma sa
Ma ma coo sa 
Ma ma se, ma ma sa

Please don't stop the music (2x)

I wanna take you away 
Lets escape into the music 
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it 
Like the way you do this 
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the 
Please don't stop the music (2x)

Ma ma se, ma ma sa
Ma ma coo sa 
Ma ma se, ma ma sa
Ma ma coo sa (6x)
