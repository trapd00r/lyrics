Send "When The Night Comes Falling" Ringtone to your Cell You see me running like I'm out of my mind 
A cloud of worries staying close behind 
A constant pain of working overtime 
I'm just another face in another line 
But there is hope to seek in times of madness 
This day is almost done 

When the night comes falling I'll be calling 
We'll go crazy and spend our pay 
As the sun is setting we're forgetting 
Everything will be okey 
Everything will be okey 

Another day and I am done once more 
I keep on working but don't know what for 
A lot of effort for a tiny score 
But none of this will matter when I'm gone for sure 
But there is hope to seek in times of madness 
'Cause time is on our side 

When the night comes falling I'll be calling 
We'll go crazy and spend our pay 
As the sun is setting we're forgetting 
Everything will be okey 
Everything will be okey 

It takes a dream to keep us alive 
To keep us moving on 
And though it seems we're just getting by 
Together we're still strong (Together we're still strong) 

When the night comes falling I'll be calling 
We'll go crazy and spend our pay 
As the sun is setting we're forgetting 
Everything will be okey 
(When the night comes falling I'll be calling) 
The night will get you through the day 
As the sun is setting we're forgetting 
Everything will be okey 
Everything will be okey
