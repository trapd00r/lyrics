Right at the front door I recognised the perfume 
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon 
There must be many ways to ask her to my room 
Why didn't I dare? 
Well every hour I try to get somethin' done 
Out on the weekend when I'm just havin' some fun 
I'm windin' up with none, just zeroes, no 1's , just space with no air 

- I get: "Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye..." 

Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls 
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all 
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be 
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need 
That's what I need 

Yea, every Friday I'm getting ready to roll 
I want her blue eyes start sayin' "Hi" and "Hello" 
but I can always tell she'd rather be allone with some other guy 

(Real sugar) 

- I get: "Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye..." 

Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls 
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all 
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be 
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need 
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls 
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all 
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be 
Real sugar, that's what you've got so what's for me? 
Hey, what's for me? 

I turn myself in, turn turn turn 
I turn myself out, outside and in 
I turn myself in, turn turn turn 
I turn myself out, outside and in 

Real sugar 
Real sugar 

- I get: "Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye..." 

Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls 
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all 
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be 
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need 
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls 
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all 
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be 
Real sugar, that's what you've got so what's for me? 

Real sugar, gimme gimme real sugar 
Real sugar, gimme gimme real sugar 
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb no walls 
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb no walls
