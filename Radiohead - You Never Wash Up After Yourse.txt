Send "You Never Wash Up After Yourself" Ringtone to your Cell I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
Spiders crawl over the bed

I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
You never wash up after yourself
