I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I've kept the movie rolling
But the story's getting old now

Oh yeah

Well I just looked in the mirror
And things aren't looking so good
I'm looking California
And feeling Minnesota

Oh yeah

So now you know
Who gets mystified
So now you know
Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'til I'm up on my feet again

Hey I'm feeling 
Oh I'm feeling
outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

Oh yeah

Someone let the dogs out
They'll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shitting

Oh yeah

I'm feeling that I'm sober
Even though I'm drinking
I can't get any lower
Still I feel I'm sinking

So now you know
Who gets mystified
So now you know
Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That i'm down on my knees today
yeah it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'til I'm up on my feet again

I'm feeling
Oh I'm feeling
outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

Ooh yeah!

Outshined

So now you know
Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
It gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'til I'm up on my feet again

Oh I'm feeling
Oh i'm feeling

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'til I'm up on my feet again

Oh I'm feeling 
Oh I'm feeling
outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined
