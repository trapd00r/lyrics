Sometimes a man and a woman spend 30 or 40 years together
And they don't belong together
Then one day one of them tries to leave
And does but in a most peculiar way

He: 
Woman, one of these days I'm leaving
Leaving you far behind
And on that day you'll be greeving
Greeve on woman, I don't mind
Look out in the backyard, mama!
Cause I'm leaving you real soon
Gonna fly me up to heaven
In my big red balloon

She: 
You're noting but an old fool
And that's all you'll ever be
You're nothing but an old fool
You know you'll never leave me
So stop your silly playing
It's time you settle down
And hear me when I'm saying:
"You'll never get that damn thing off the ground"

He:
Oh, woman, are you looking
Cause I'm almost 10 feet high, high, high
Woman stop your cooking
Cause I'll never eat that pie
I'm on my way to heaven
Might even touch the moon
We've needed by my leaving
In my big red balloon

She:
You're noting but an old fool
And that's all you'll ever be
You're nothing but an old fool
You know you'll never leave me
So stop your silly playing
It's time you settled down
You better hear me when I'm saying:
"You'll never get that damn thing off the ground"

He:
You never gave me loving
You never were the kind
You never gave me children
You never had the time
Remember me to no-one
I was born this afternoon
I've got it all together
In my big red balloon

She:
You're noting but an old fool
And that's all you'll ever be
Now you're nothing but an old fool
You know you'll never leave me
So come on and stop your silly playing
It's time you settle down
And hear me when I'm saying:
"You'll never get that damn thing off the ground"

You will never get that damn thing off the ground
I say, you won't get that on the ground
What are your doing up there?
Bring that damn thing back down here!
Listen now you hear me
Get back down here boy
