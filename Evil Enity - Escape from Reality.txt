Send "Higher Than the Sky" Ringtone to your Cell [ Swano ]

I woke up laying in this bed
I didn't know if I was 'live or dead
Have I returned to reality
Have I escaped this evil entity?

I'v been...
Higher than the sky
Falling in and out of time
Once I saw him die
My remorse ain't worth a dime

If I only knew what was going on
I hear no voices, pray to god that they're gone
Someone must have found and then brought me here
I have been released from all the doubt and fear
Then this woman came into the room
She was so scared, but still she tried to stay
She spoke a tongue I couldn't understand
My guardian angel from a foreign land

She tried to explain how she brought me here
She found me lifeless in the cold
And there was something about me that wasn't right
So she rescued me from eternal night
And even though I can't understand the words she's saying
She's talking to my soul
And there is mystery in her gleaming eyes
