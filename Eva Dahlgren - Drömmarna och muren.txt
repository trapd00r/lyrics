Don't pick on me
I'm no one
Don't pick on me
It's no use
Don't pick on me
I'm nothing
Don't pick on me
I cannot lose
Ain't worth trying
I just lie me a truth
Don't pick on me
I'm no good
Don't pick on me
It takes time to change
I don't know if I want to
Fantasy world is a lovely place
I live in closed rooms
With closed eyes
And lovely lies
Don't push, don't push
I don't want, don't want
Your reality don't need me
Don't puch, don't push
I don't want, don't want
I've got my paradise inside of me
don't push
Don't pick on me
I'm happy
Don't pick on me
I don't bother you
My fantasy is a lovely picture
Your reality is an ugly truth
So go on crying
While I laugh me a truth
Don't pick on me
I'm stronger
Don't try to pick on me
while I'm in here
I've got lifetime protection
Rollerblind in my mind
Open slightly
What do I see
Everything I don't want to be
