The chief of a tribe had a daughter so pretty whoÂ´d be sacrificed to a God
But a warrior fell in love for the pretty indian and run away with her

CHORUS
The God`s revenge was very brutal
He turned her into a rock in the river
And the warrior in a tree on the edge of the abyss
Where he contemplates his love
In the bottom of the abyss it has a cave
Where this God guards the passionate lovers

When this God discovered about their escape
He twisted His body and became a huge snake
Diving wildly in the peaceful waters opening a hollow

CHORUS

SOLO ANDREAS KISSER
SOLO GERALDO

At the top of that pit
He contemplates his love and he can never touch her face again
The pretty indian is always bathed in a veil of clear and fresh waters to alleviate her pain

Every spring he throws flowers in the waters of the river, RIVER, RIVER
As a proof of his love

He opened a hollow in the river
Creating the big waterfalls
Where the escaper fell from a huge height disappearing eternally
