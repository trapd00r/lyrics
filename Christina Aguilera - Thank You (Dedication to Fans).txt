I feel like I been locked up
Oh oh oh oh ooh
My body's saying let's go
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Come on, come on
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)

(I grant you three wishes coz I be the genie)
(Christina Aguilera)

Oh oh oh oh ooh

It seems like a lifetime since I felt like a prisoner of my dreams, yeah
It took such a long time for me to realize just how to be
And to listen to me
Don't go thinking I'm not thankful
'Cause me, I've got my hands full of good things.. ooh
And I hope I can give back a little bit of what you've given me

(I absolutely love your music)
(You inspire me to keep on living)
(So what you gotta say)

So thank you for standing right by me (I will always love you)
So thank you for being behind me (you are just so amazing)
And watching me grow
And letting others know
That you'll still believe in what I'll be
