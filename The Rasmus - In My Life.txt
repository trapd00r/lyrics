Feel the heat below my feet
I have to go, no time to sleep
Can't believe the things you say 
I turn my head and walk away
You make me sick, you make me nervous

Time to go when you would say 
This is the one and seize the day
Time to go for honesty
"My victory is your defeat"
Can't you see you've been mistaken

In my life I decide and it turns me on
How I am, how I live, who I love
Yeah
In my way I feel strong 
And it turns me on
In my life I decide, I decide
I decide

All you do, you can't deny 
Is waste of time and waste of life
Can I suggest that you invest
In something more than hopelessness
Before you know the ride is over

In my life I decide and it turns me on
How I am, how I live, who I love
In my way, I feel strong
And it turns me on
In my life, I decide, I decide

It's up to you if you give it up
It's up to you if you won't stop
It's up to you if you give it up
It's up to you if you won't stop 

It's up to you if you give it up, give it up 
It's up to you if you won't stop
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up, 
It's up to you, it's up to you

The record shows that you're dead but you're still living
Every time you have died you have been given
Another chance to fix your bad attitude
And make a move, it's up to you 

It's up to you if you give it up, give it up 
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up 
It's up to you if you give it up, give it up 

It's up to you
It's up to you

You
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up
