(Chorus)
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But its alright, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance .
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

(Eminem)
Im that guy man, shove a dime up in my hind end,
And crush it with my butt muscles as I cut vocals,
Slut poke holes in your shirt jump in mud puddles,
While I stomp mud holes in your ass girl lets cuddle,
Blood curdling on your girdle whatll,
I do for my next trick Im feeling wonderful,
I think I might just do something a little less subtle,
Shove a fucking Tonka truck up a little kids butt hole,
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash Ambassador,
of the Valentines Day massacre slash assassin,
I slash her in ass with an icicle and leave her in a blood bath while I,
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her,
In my Spider-Man mask just imagine,
The fun I can have with a strap on,
Stick up a Kim Kardashians ass,
And make the bitch run a triathlon,
Are those pistachios? Damn id like to have some,
Laying on the patio man rolling a fat one,
Shady drop the magic marker put the cap on,
Goddamn man are you that much of an asshole.

(Chorus)
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But its alright, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance .
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

(Eminem)
I'm like Houdini,
Tuck my teeny, eenie, weenie between each,
one of my thighs and make it disappear like Houdini.
Make this shit disappear like Tara Ried in a bikini,
Believe me homie you don't know the meaning of a meanie.
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter,
I'm tryna maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot, don't move or ya,
Might get it stuck up so fuckin' far up in your uvula,
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to your gloutius.
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studio,
Now who do ya think is more fruitier?
Weenier's smothered in peanut butter,
Pudding on the tube of your eye shadow,
And that'd look nice, you shoulda seen it mother.
I think I put a piece of art on my Visa card,
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a cuisinart,
And mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's, with McDonald's,
Jump in her lap and watch the Sopranos.

(Chorus)
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But its alright, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance .
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

(Eminem)
Shady what're ya doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat and hide a clue in the back room,
And assumin' the fact that that dude's in the back room,
Usin' the bathroom, vacuumin' a raccoon,
Skewin' a rat, a cat, screwin' a baboon.
You shouldn't ask, "What is he doin' with that broom?".
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds,
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh.
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin,
By the hair and make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'.
Shady why do you gotta pick on the lady for,
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you and baby-tard?
'Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed,
Kelly Pickler hid my juicebox under my bassinet,
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed,
Do you like graffiti dike? Well I can pee-pee and write your name.

(Eminem)
It feels so wrong, does it feel so right? But its alright, it's okay with me.
I'll do my steps all by myself, I don't need nobody to play with me,
But if you just give me a chance, I can put you in a trance the way I dance .
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm taking my ball and going home (home).

(Outro)
