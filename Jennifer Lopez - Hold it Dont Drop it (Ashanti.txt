You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cos you got what I need
You got me all open
And I ain't tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it

Every time I try to run
Something keeps stalking me (oh, keeps stalking me)
I try my best to turn around
But your touch won't let me leave (uh, uh, yeah, yeah)
I can't control it
You put something inside of me, ooh
'Cos you're a problem
Boy, you must've poisoned me, ooh

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cos you got what I need
You got me all open
And I ain't tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it

Boy, I must be buggin'
Let you play those games I don't understand (oh, I can't understand)
I be the yo-yo on a string
Throw it down, I come right back to your hands (uh, uh, that's right, uh)
I make excuses but we keep on rocking anyway, ooh
But it ain't working
When I let you go, you make me stay

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cos you got what I need
You got me all open
And I ain't tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it

Won't let me leave
Control of me
You got what I need, yeah
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it

Won't let you go, can't let you leave
I need your love inside of me
You got control, control of me
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cos you got what I need
You got me all open
And I ain't tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cos you got what I need
You got me all open
And I ain't tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it
Don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it
Won't stop it
