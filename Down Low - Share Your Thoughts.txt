Send "Once Upon A Time" Ringtone to your Cell All alone without you yeah
so alone, so alone
without you (X2)
Until that day I see you again
Death do us part your long lost friend
Can't wait to see your face again
I'll be here for you my friend

Seems like thru life problems, pleasure and pain
I've always been here and I will remain
remembering the days and the times we shared
If you need me yo! I'd be right there.
But now you're all gone
and I'm here all alone
and now i must face life on my own
I wish you could be here to hold my hand
somethings in life i can't understand
What I'm gonna do without you?
Why did you leave without me?
Sometimes love comes randomly
but now it abandons me (abandons me)
Every morning I wish I could see your face
now a quiet void lies here in you place
and till that day I see you again
death do us part your long lost friend

All alone without you (so alone, so alone)
uuh all alone without you
until that day I see you again
death do us part your long lost friend
can't wait to see your face again
I'll be here for you my friend

Share my chains, share my cost
take my pain, take my lost
and if I could turn back the hands of time
we would be here together now in our minds
forever in my thoughts, shall your vision run
till the end of time, till times undone
this world is dividing us
and can't provide for us (but still)
but still i believe I'll reach that day
and when i come up around your way
always have a place reserved for me
and where I deserve to be
and if I seem to be lost in the storm
forgive me, by and by, and keep me norm
cos till that day I see you again
death do us part your long lost friend

All alone without you (so alone, so alone)
uuh all alone without you
until that day I see you again
death do us part your long lost friend
can't wait to see your face again
I'll be here for you my friend
