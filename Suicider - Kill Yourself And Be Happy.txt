Send "Passion for Suicide" Ringtone to your Cell The thought is stimulating, (the) feeling is right
Darkness, despair, so cold, I dare

Tied in chains and strangled, release me from myself
A nameless grave is waiting, so close, yet so far away

Self-inflicted: I have suffered the greatest sufferings
Fullfiled my heart with torture, caused myself the ultimate pain

My scars are bleeding, my wounds are impaled
Satan, be my master, feed me with hunger, please me with pain

Why was I born when the passion for suicide is so strong?

Nails in my wrist, thorns in my soul
Master Satan, I am yours, feed me with hunger, please me with pain

I am forlorn, but the passion for suicide will soon be gone

Kill yourself, feel the perfection in death
