Uno, dos, tres, quatro!

Oh Romeo, where do you have your Juliet now?
Oh Romeo, where do you have your girlfriend now?
You used to be the one everyone wanted to be
(Everybody wanted to be)
You used to be the one and only for those girls
But look at you!

Chours
Oh Romeo, where do you have your Juliet?
Romeo where's your girlfriend? (x2)

You never thought somebody like her would come in your way
You never thought, no, your lady in chains could walk out on you
Yesterdays flowers they don't mean much now
(Flowers they don't mean a thing)
You treated her just like dirt and now it's too late
So look at you

Chorus

I know you know the lady was a 10 out of 10
She was a knockout!
Everybody knew about the 2 of you
And why a son of a gun like you let her go

If you can't treat your lady with respect
/You're not a true man for her)
Hand her over to real men, to somebody who cares
Who respect her!

Oh Romeo, where do you have your Juliet?
Romeo, wheres your girlfriend?
Where is your little pretty girlfriend?
Oh Romeo, how could you do this to her?

Romeo, oooh-o-oooh, Romeo! (x2)
Chorus
