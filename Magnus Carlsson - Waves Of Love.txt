Send "Waves of Love" Ringtone to your Cell Don't try to hide it
That you've been looking at me
I won't deny it
You woke my curiosity
So if you want me come closer if you dare
I love the way you turn me on
I wanna feel ya
Your body next to mine
So come on baby, let's get down

I'm calling your name
Feeling the rush - I'm so excited
Riding on the big waves of love
I'm loving this game
Stick to the beat - we've found the rhythm
Riding on the big waves of love
Big waves of love
Oh-oo - do you feel the fire now
Oh-oo - burning tonight

It's almost frightening
My fantasy coming true
Electrifying
My pulse is high cause of you, yeah
Don't be a fool and let this moment pass us by
I love the way you turn me on
I wanna feel you near,
Your body close to mine
So come on babe and let's get down

I'm calling your name
Feeling the rush - I'm so excited
Riding on the big waves of love
I'm loving this game
Stick to the beat - we've found the rhythm
Riding on the big waves of love
Big waves of love
Oh-oo - do you feel the fire now
Oh-oo - burning tonight

Oh-oo - might have found the one
Oh-oo - that I've been dreaming about
Ah-aa - let us have some fun
The night's still young

Riding on the waves of love

I'm calling your name
Feeling the rush - I'm so excited
Riding on the big waves of love
I'm loving this game
Stick to the beat - we've found the rhythm
Riding on the big waves of love
Big waves of love

Oh-oo - do you feel the fire now
Oh-oo - burning tonight
Oh-oo - do you feel the fire now
Oh-oo - burning tonight
