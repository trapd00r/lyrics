on ya waste and blood on your shoe because a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you, homie
you ain't been threw what I been threw you not like me and I'm not like you.

[Verse 2]
I'm like an animal wit it when I spit it's crazy, got semi-autos to put holes and niggas try to play me,
One shot is not enough you need at least a uzi to move me, after four bottles of don
the kid start to feeling woozy, I write my life you write what you see in gangsta movies, I'm
gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me, I find my space at the top I got this rap shit
