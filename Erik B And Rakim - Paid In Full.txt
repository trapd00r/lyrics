[Rakim] 
Thinkin of a master plan 
Cuz ain't nuthin but sweat inside my hand 
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent 
So I dig deeper but still comin up with lint 
So I start my mission- leave my residence 
Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents 
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid 
So I think of all the devious things I did 
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin funny 
Stop smiling, be still, don't nuthin move but the money 
But now I learned to earn cos I'm righteous 
I feel great! so maybe I might just 
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive 
Then maybe I'll stay alive 
So I walk up the street whistlin this 
Feelin out of place cos, man, do I miss 
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of 
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of 
Fish, which is my favorite dish 
But without no money it's still a wish 
Cos I don't like to dream about gettin paid 
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made 
To now test to see if I got pull 
Hit the studio, cos I'm paid in full
