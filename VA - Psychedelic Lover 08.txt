another year it's christmas
we waited all year long until this day
little lights are shining
and all the problems seem so far away

ooo i see the childrens faces
excited for the gifts they will recieve
ooo you see the people smiling
can you hear the jingle bells

navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday
navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday

when you're looking through the windows
you see familys in harmony
but it is sad to know that
there are also people who feel so alone

ooo i hope that santa claus will
bring a shining light to all of them
maybe he can bring a box of
happiness and love to them

navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday
navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday

navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday
navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday

the day will come,
there is peace on earth for everyone
and not only for just one day
having peace, isn't that
what we all want
let us pray for a better world

navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday
navidad, navidad
ooo it should be christmas everyday
