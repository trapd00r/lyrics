It's daybreak
And you are asleep
I can hear you breathe now
Your breath is deep

But before I go
I look at you one last time
I can hear a heartbeat
Is it yours or is it mine?

I look at your lips
I know how soft they can be
Did they know what they wanted
The times they kissed me?

And your hands
That I held in mine
Now they're reposing on the pillow
Will they ever miss me sometime?

I'll remember you
You will be there in my heart
I'll remember you
And that is all that I can do

But I'll remember
Your eyes
That always make me shiver
Now they are closed

They just sometimes twitch a little
And your body
I could hold for an hour
It sent me to Heaven

With its heat and power
I'll remember you
You will be there in my heart
I'll remember you

And that is all that I can do
But I'll remember
