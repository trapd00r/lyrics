Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
In other words, please, be true
In other words, I love you

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
In other words, please, be true
In other words, I love you

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
Fly me to the moon
Fly me to the moon
