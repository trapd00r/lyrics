Babygirl...I said tonight is your lucky night
Peter Andre along wid Bubbler Ranx on de mic

I stop and stare at you
walking on the shore...
I try to concentrate
my mind wants to explore...
the tropical scent of you
takes me up above...
and girl when I look at you
Oh I fall in love!

No doubt you look so fine
girl I wanna make you mine
I want to be with a woman just like you
No doubt I'm the only man
who can love you like I can
so just let me be with the woman that I love

Babygirl... shinin  looking glass

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, mysterious girl
move your body close to mine

Girl you are mi heart desire
and you alone a set mi soul pan fire
mi tell them
girl you a mi heart desire
you alone.......watch dis

Watching the sun go down
the tide is drifting in
we can get closer now
and feel the warmth within
'cause I'm looking in your eyes
feeling so alive
and girl when you touch me
it's time to take it through the night

Girl I wanna be with you
I wanna spend the night with you
I need to be with the woman that I love
Girl I wanna do to you
all the things you want me to
i need to be with the woman that I love

Babygirl... let your loving release

Oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you (so close to you my baby)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, mysterious girl
move your body close to mine

Well I've been sitting by the phone hoping you'd call
when time mi hear your voice I feel ten feet tall
body weh yu ave vek de man dem a bawl
man I trip over man when time yu name call
your pretty looks surround me like a flowers of bloom
And I love the smell of your 'elizabeth taylor' perfume
your personality alone light up de room
just one kiss alone a make mi heart go boom

Oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you (c'mon now, c'mon now)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, mysterious girl
move your body close to mine

Girl you are mi heart desire
and you alone a set mi soul pan fire
