Falling down outside your head.
You do your best to turn the tide
But can't forget ev'rythin' he said.
The pressure's getting far too great
The word together came too late.

What do you do when your love breaks up
Do you fall apart like a butter cup.
Forget about tomorrow
Surround yourself with sorrow.

Do you fall apart like a butter cup.
Forget about tomorrow
Surround yourself with sorrow.

You watch the water falling down
Like a neon in your head.
The neon's flashing off and on
Recalling ev'rything he said.
You've lost the fight for love today
Your dreams are shattered, thrown away.

What do you do when your love breaks up
Do you fall apart like a butter cup.
Forget about tomorrow
Surround yourself with sorrow.
