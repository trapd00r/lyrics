What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back, back into time

Yeah, yeah-yeah

(Donny Hathaway, Leena Horne)
(Miss Aretha, (The Real Thing) James Brown, Billie Holiday)
(Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Louis Armstrong)
(Minnie Riperton, Otis Redding, Etta James)

Back in the day, they used to say
Play that song, get it going, and the band played
And still today, you hear us say
Play that song all night long, Mr. DJ
Though times have changed,
It's still the same
We all need a minute to get away
So let it go and feel the flow
If you've got soul, let the world know

We're gonna set the mood (set the mood off right)
Gonna go back to an old school groove (go back to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
When the originators, innovators were alive, yeah

Here we say now
So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday
Open your mind, enjoy the ride,
Live out tonight and grab that Soul Train

Take it back, take it
Back in the day, back in the day
Oh baby
Back in the day, back in the day
Won't you take me back?
Back in the day, back in the day
I'll do it
Back in the day, back in the day

Ohh yeah

Y'all remember back in the day, you dig
Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald

Yeah
Now "Chain Of Fools" and "Respect"
Was the anthem of a woman, Aretha said
"What's Going On", "Let's Get It On"
Such classic songs, don't forget them
Though times have changed
They still remain my inspiration everyday
So give it up for the ones
Who came before, opened up that door

We're gonna set the mood
(we're gonna) (set the mood)
Gonna go back to an old school groove
(go back) (to an old school groove)
Gonna rewind to another time
(rewind) (another time)
When the originators, innovators were alive

So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday

Back in the day, back in the day

So get up, re-live it
Gotta let yourself flow
Give up your praise
Come celebrate
Just get up, get on it
Get yourself on the floor
Don't back away (don't back away)
Come celebrate (gonna celebrate, yeah)

So break out the Marvin Gaye and Etta James
Your Lady Day, and Coltrane
Turn up your 45's, bring back to life
The sound and vibe of yesterday

Live out tonight and grab that Soul Train

Takin' back in the day, day
