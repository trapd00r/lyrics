Send "The Outsiders" Ringtone to your Cell Shortfalls and little sins 
Close calls and no one wins 
Stand tall but running thin 
I’m wearing thin 

Oh, why are we keeping score? 
Cause if you’re not laughing, 
Who is laughing now? 
I’ve been wondering 
If we stop sinking 
Could we stand our ground? 
And through everything we’ve learned 
We’ve finally come to terms, 
We are the outsiders. 
Oh, we are the outsiders, oh 

I’m not leaving without a fight. 
I got my holster around my side. 
Just ‘cause I’m wrong it don’t make you right. 
No you ain’t right. 

Oh, why are we keeping score? 
Cause if you’re not laughing, 
Who is laughing now? 
I’ve been wondering if we stop sinking, 
Would we stand our ground? 
And through everything we’ve learned, 
We’ve finally come to terms. 
We are the outsiders, 
Oh we are the outsiders, x7

You’re free to roam 
On the outside 
We found it home 
On the outside 
There’s more to see 
On the outside 
We choose to be)x2
