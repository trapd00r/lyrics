I can picture you asleep in your bed
A massive explosion of thoughts in your head
Life is complicated when you fall in love and out again

Oh I can feel you
I can hear you
I can see you in your room
Oh I can kiss you
I can taste your mouth - I can nearly touch your face
Oh how I miss you
How I miss you
How I long for your embrace
From a million miles away

I can picture you in the silver of the rain
You?ve got so many thoughts running round in your brain 
Time seems confiscated when
You fall in love and out again

Oh I can feel you
I can hear you
I can see you in your room
Oh I can kiss you

I can taste your mouth - I can nearly touch your face
Oh how I miss you
How I miss you
How I long for your embrace
From a million miles away

I can picture you asleep in your bed
Imagine your body like flickering red 
Life is complicated when
You fall in love and out again, you fall in love and out again

Oh I can feel you
I can hear you
I can see you in your room
Oh I can kiss you
I can taste your mouth - I can nearly touch your face
Oh how I miss you
How I miss you
How I long for your embrace
From a million miles away
