There is the one ceiling the lies
A fine veil over your eyes
Even the ocean, holding the tide
Your hopes while you're slaving for time

This is the one who knows no regret
Who knows who you are
You've never met
But one day he'll find you
Where ever you are
Owner of land he never walked on

All shadows, even the sun
All shadows, even the sun
All shadows, even the sun
Without a doubt he knows how to count your tears

There is the one ceiling the lies
A fine veil over your eyes
Wake up one day and you'll realize how
Hard you've been running most of your life

All shadows, even the sun
All shadows, even the sun
All shadows, even the sun
Without a doubt he knows how to count your tears
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
He waves at the old with his back to the wall
Waves at the young, the lost, the bored
Giving the sad eye while in his mind
You're not adding straws to the pile

Maybe he'll give you a few more years
Placing the time glass on your stairs
From that day your life's caving in
You'll blame yourself, no one ever blames him

All shadows, all shadows
All shadows, even the sun
Without a doubt he knows how to count your tears
