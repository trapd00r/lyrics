Lonely, I'm so lonely
I have nobody to call my own
I am so lonely, I'm so lonely
I have nobody to call my own
I am so lonely 

Y'all, This one here goes out to all my playas out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, dawg 
That's always been there, man 
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she couldn't take it no more and decided to leave

Yeah
I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin for her
I was feelin so I had to take a little ride 
Backtracking on these few years
Tryin'a figure out what I do to make it go bad
Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

(Lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

(I am so lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through 
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
Cause without you in my life girl I'm so...

(Lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

(I am so lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl 
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run 
And I would be out chasing you
Ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
Then the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

(Lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

(I am so lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
Stop playing girl and come on home
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished to ever hurt my baby
And its drivin' me crazy cuz I'm so...

(Lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

(I am so lonely) so lonely
(I'm Mr. Lonely) Mr. Lonely
(I have nobody) I have nobody
(For my own) to call my own girl

So lonely, so lonely
Mr. Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely
So lonely, Mr. Lonely
