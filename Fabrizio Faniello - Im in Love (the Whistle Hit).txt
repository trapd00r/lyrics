Send "I'm in Love (The Whistle Hit)" Ringtone to your Cell No matter what they say now I¢m in love,
I do it in my way cause I¢m in love,
And I can keep that song out of my mind,
whistling that silly tune all the time.

(whistle)... 

No matter what they say, I don¢t care,
I whistle  any way everywhere,
I wrote this little song on my own,
She said that I¢m a genius; I¢m in love,

My friends¢ say that I¢m crazy, I¢m just fine,
My neighbors stair at me, never mind,
Cause every time this sweetness of her smile,
My supersonic girl, I¢m in love.

Whistling that silly tune all the time.
