The queen of these filthy streets, always knows what to do
As fast as she can blink the eye, she's gonna scare the hell out of
you She's my sweet little rebel queen, she's the girl next door She
looks really hot in her tight blue jeans, she's the girl I've been
looking for

kertos√§e:
She's the most beautiful pearl, she's my skinhead girl
Can't even keep my eyes off her, she's my skinhead girl Everybody
looks after her, she's my skinhead girl All the others are just the
same, but my babe they can never tame

She don't care what the others do, don't care what they say She's the
vagabond of these streets, that's the way she lives today No one can
twist her mind, she just wanna make love with her life When she come
through the night I know, she's the girl I've been waiting for
