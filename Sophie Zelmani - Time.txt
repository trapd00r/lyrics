Time to close up the chest now baby
It’s time I know
To make up the room now baby
It’s time I know

Got to move it a little further
Back from the welcome hall
I’ve got to surround it, baby
With thick thick walls

But listen through the keyhole
How your neighbor sings
For the sorrow light
That you bring

But you danced with me darling

Time to forgo it baby
It’s time I know
Some kinds can just be stored, honey
For the better go

But you danced with me darling
