[Eminem Snortin Crack]

[Tv Presenter:]
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
[Door opens]
who's your daddy? 

[Hailie:]
Daddy, what're you doing? 

Beat starts 

[Eminem:]
Haha 

[Eminem & Hailie:]
Ok then! everybody, listen up! 

[Eminem:]
I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me? 

[Hailie:]
Somebody, please help him!
[giggle]
i think my dad gone crazy! 

[Verse #1:]
There's no mountain i can't climb
There's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, destroy you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chain off to
[Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound]
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off 

[Dr Dre:]
Suck it marshall 

[Eminem:]
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and that's all
[Hailie Makes Explosion Sound]
Blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off
When will it stop, when will we knock the crap off
[Knocking]
Hailie, tell 'em baby 

[Haley:]
My dad's lost it 

[Chorus:]
[Eminem:]
There's really nothin' else to say to ya, i can't explain it 

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy! 

[Eminem:]
A little help from hailie jade wont you tell them baby

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy! 

[Eminem:]
Theres nothing you could do to save me, could never change me 

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy! 

[Eminem:]
There's noone on earth that can save me, not even hailie 

[Hailie:]
I think my dad gone crazy! 

[Verse 2:]
It's like my mother always told me
[Eminem Impersinates His Mom]
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana, n codeine n goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er..
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flos, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my ammo
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more? 

[Hailey:]
Dad 

[Chorus]

[Verse #3:]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise     At the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
So what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd gank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like R.Kelly as soon as "Bump n' Grind" comes on
More pain inside o' my brain, in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
Aimed at the world trade, standin' on ronny's grave,
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
And thats pretty much the just of it,
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heater's stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither 

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
[Eminem:]
Crazy 

[Hailie:]
[laughs]
You're funny daddy!
