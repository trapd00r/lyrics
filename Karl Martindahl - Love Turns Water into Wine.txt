Send "Love Turns Water Into Wine" Ringtone to your Cell A little luck is here tonight
I can use it
A little faith is by my side
To take me trough it

I believe that Iâ€™m gonna win
I believe that miracles don't end

Oh, it's happenin'
I'm fallin' in
Givin' in
Feels so good
Love turns water into wine
Cause walkin' in, everything will begin
Just let it in
Feels so good
Love turns water into wine

And everything will be alright
I can do it
And every dream will come alive
Nothing to it

I belive that I'm gonna win
I belive that miracles don't end

Oh, it's happenin'
I'm fallin' in
Givin' in
Feels so good
Love turns water into wine
Cause walkin' in, everything will begin
Let it in
Feels so good
Love turns water into wine

And it taste like heaven

I can walk on water 
I can walk through anything
I let it in

(Ooh, yeah)

Oooh!
Love turns water into wine
(Yeah)
Walkin' in, everything will begin
Just let it in
Feels so good
(Love turns water into wine)

Wooh!
It's happenin' 
I'm fallin' in 
Just give it in
Love turns water into wine
Love turns water into wine

And it taste like heaven
