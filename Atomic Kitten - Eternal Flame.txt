Sleep baby, sleep, lose yesterday's blues
When you're ready for morning have I got news
Our ship's in the harbor the street's turning gold
Whatever you're dreaming, it's no longer on hold
Dream baby, dream while you were asleep
I had mountains to climb and a promise to keep
Now home is the hunter and holding the prize
I'm waiting tell you when you open your eyes

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming
Is this burning, an eternal flame

Smile baby, smile through canyon's of night
But you'll really be smiling by morning's light
They told us we're crazy, they promised I'd lose
Forgive and forget them, they're yesterday's news

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming without you it's nothing
Why else would I climb
Together forever, hearts beating in time, oooh

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning, an eternal flame

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand (do you understand)
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming (dreaming)
Or is this burning, an eternal flame

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling (Give me your hand)
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand (Give me your hand)
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming (dreaming)
Is this burning, an eternal flame
