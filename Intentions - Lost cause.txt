Send "Lost Cause" Ringtone to your Cell even if we say we do, it don't mean that we will
it don't mean that we're going to
even if we say we'll try it don't mean
that we'll have the opportunity

all this time weighed out unrefined
twisted and unkind. all mine
all this pain suddenly arranged
a relationship that i've denied

my backs against the wall
i stumble and fall down
sometimes i scream
I'm scratchin' at my head
I'd rather be dead than not in your arms
in your arms, in your arms

even if we say we do it don't mean that we will
it don't mean that we're going to
even if we say we'll try it don't mean
that we'll have the opportunity

my backs against the wall
i stumble and fall down
sometimes i scream
i'm scratchin' at my head
i'd rather be dead than not
in your arms, in your arms, in your arms
my backs against the wall
i stumble and fall down
and sometimes i scream

my backs against the wall
i stumble and fall down
sometimes i scream
i'm scratchin' at my head
i'd rather be dead than not
in your arms, in your arms, in your arms
my backs against the wall
i stumble and fall down
and sometimes i scream
