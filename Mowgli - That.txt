Ten silver spoons coming after me,
One life with one dream on repeat
I’ll escape if I try hard enough,
Till King of the Jungle calls my bluff

Oh Lord (Oh Lord)
I have been told (I have been told)
That I must take the unforsaken road (forsaken road)
There’s a fork in the road (road)
I’ll do as I am told
And I don’t know, don’t know, don’t know, don’t, don’t
Who-oo-oo-oo-ooo I want to be

Cuckoo (cuckoo)

Cuckoo (cuckoo, cuckoo)

You say Y-E-S to everything
Will that guarantee you a win?
Do you think you will be good enough
To love others and to be loved?

Oh Lord (Oh Lord),
Now I can see (now I can see)
The cutlery will keep on chasing me (forsaken road)
There’s a fork in the road (road)
I’ll do as I am told
And I don’t know, don’t know, don’t know, don’t don’t
Who-oo-oo-oo-ooo I want to be.

We are the spoons metally mean
We scooped our way into your dreams
To knock the knives out bloody cold
And lead you down the unforsaken road

[whistle]

(Unforsaken road)
There’s a fork in the road (road)
I’ll do as I am told
And I don’t know, don’t know, don’t know, don’t don’t
Who-oo-oo-oo-ooo I want to be.
