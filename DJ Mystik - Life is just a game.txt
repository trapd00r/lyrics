Your talking about the moon
appears a little weird
as the radio plays romantic tunes
your heart is getting seared.
Every starry night in June
you declare a mystic sign
in your point of view incredible -
predictions work out fine.
Each time we´re out together
your funny words sound better
you tend to complicate
the simple things in life.
(chorus)
Follow my star
and it will guide you to
where you belong,
don´t wait too long
for there´s a reason
you could do no wrong.
Follow my star
and it will guide you through
the longest night,
don´t hesitate
it might be blinding 
for it shines so bright.

You´re reading horoscopes
each word you do believe.
As a matter of fact your poems
show a state you have to leave.
Any little step you take
you want me to precede,
would you ever listen if I drop 
the charming lines you need?
Each time we´re out together
your funny words sound better,
you tend to complicate
the simple things in life.
