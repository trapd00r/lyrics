11 years old, makin' A's and B's
and these lil mommy's can't keep their hands off me
when you see in the streets holla what's up doc
I gotta a bugs bunny chain wit a matchin' watch
I make you jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation, I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy, but live a big man's life
I got girls passin' up wanna be my wife
Got grown women wanna be in my life
by the time I'm 18 I'm not gon be nothin' nice
I'm that R-O-M-E-O, after high school
I'm goin' straight to the pro's (bounce,bounce)
