Mmmhh

You high baby?

Yeahh...

Yeah?

hahaha..Talk to me...

You want me to tell you somethin?

Uh huh...

I know what you wanna hear...
'Cuz I know you want me baby I think I want you too...

I think I love you baby...
think I love you too...
I'm here to save you girl,
Come be in shady's world,
I wanna grow together,
Let's let our love unfurl.

Times at night when I look out to the sky
I start to think of you and I asked myself why
"Why do I love you?" - I think and smile
Because I know the List could run on for miles

But I do know one thing though,
Bitches they come, they go,
Saturday through Sunday Monday,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Maybe I?ll love you one day,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fucking runway hoe...

The whisper of your voice, the warmth of your touch
My feelings are so strong and I love you so much
"Why do I love you?" - I think and smile
Because I know the list could run on for miles

Always and forever...

Don't get me wrong,
It's no secret,
Everybody knows,
Yeah we fucked
Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes,
We'll be friends,
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend,
Never know what kind of car I?ll be in,
We'll see how much you'll be partying then,
You don't want that,
Neither do I,
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys,
Too much pride,
Between you and I,
Not a jealous man, but females lie,
But I guess that's just what sluts do,
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you,
We just met and I just fucked you,

But I do know one thing though,
Bitches they come they go,
Saturday through Sunday Monday,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...

I know you want me baby,
I think I want you too...
I think I love you baby...
I think I love you too,
I'm here to save you girl,
Come be in shady's world
I wanna grow together,
Lets let our love unfurl,

The whisper of your voice, the warmth of your touch
My feelings are so strong and I love you so much
"Why do I love you?" - I think and smile
Because I know the list could run on for miles

Always and forever...

I'm not phased,
I hang around big stars all day,
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me...

Ooh yeah girl run that game...

Haily Jade...I love that name,
Love that tattoo...what's that say?
'Rot in pieces' aww that's great...

First off you don't know Marshall,
At all so don't grow partial,
That's ammo for my arsenal,
I'll snap you off that bar stool,
There goes another lawsuit,
Leave handprints all across you,
Good lordy-wody you must be blown off that water bottle,
You want what you can't have,
Ooh girl that's too damn bad,
Don't touch what you can't grab,
End up with two back hands,
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand,
Girl you just blew your chance,
Don't mean to ruin your plans.
