      You give me such a runaround
      The more that I see you
      The more you just put me down

      Even in front of all my friends
      You just wanna hurt me (Hurt me)
      But I'll never give up hoping
      'Till I make you mine, ohoho

      The harder I try (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
      The further away from me it's slipping
      I go on trying (Ooohooo) to make you love me
      (Love me, love me, love me)

      I wanted to see you (See you)
      I call you on the telephone
      Just to be near you (Near you)
      They tell me that you're not home

      I guess you could say that I'm a fool
      To want you so badly (So badly)
      But I'll never give up hoping
      'Till I make you mine, ohoho

      The harder I try (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
      The further away from me it's slipping
      I go on trying (Ooohooo) to make you love me
      (Love me, love me, love me)

      The harder I try (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
      The further away from me it's slipping
      I go on trying (Ooohooo) to make you love me
      (Love me, love me, love me)

      I go on trying, trying
      I go on trying, trying
      I go on trying, trying
      I go on trying, trying

      I should have believed them (Believed them)
      Just put them right in their place
      I tried to impress you (Impress you)
      But you threw it back in my face

      Even in front of all my friends
      You just wanna hurt me (Hurt me)
      But I'll never give up hoping
      'Till I make you mine, ohoho

      The harder I try (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
      The further away from me it's slipping
      I go on trying (Ooohooo) to make you love me
      (Love me, love me, love me)

      The harder I try (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
      The further away from me it's slipping
      I go on trying (Ooohooo) to make you love me
      (Love me, love me, love me)

      The harder I try (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
      The further away from me it's slipping
