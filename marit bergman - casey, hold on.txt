Send "Casey, Hold On" Ringtone to your Cell I can tell that you˙ve been crying
even though you try to to hide it
behind those tangled golden locks of yours

your mother˙s disappointed
and your father shut the door and told you
don˙t ever come back here anymore

But hold on Casey
Someday we˙ll be all the things that we could be
We can make it better
we˙ll find a place where we belong

Casey, your my first love
it˙s a warm and pounding true love
the kind that boys could never understand
One day I˙ll buy two one way tickets
Amsterdam or San Francisco
and we won˙t ever be afraid again

So hold on, Casey
I´ll take you by the hand for everyone to see
And they˙ll try to part us
But you know for you I can be strong
So Hold on
Casey hold on

Run away with me

they can˙t change us Casey
they can˙t fix us Casey
Cause we˙re not broken
We˙ll never be broken

Oh Casey
Tell me your my girl and that you˙ll always be
Come on dry your tears now
We´ll find a place where we´re not wrong
So hold on

Hold on Casey
Someday you´ll be all the things that you could be
We can make it better
we˙ll find a place where we belong
So Hold on
Casey be strong
Hold on
Casey hold on
