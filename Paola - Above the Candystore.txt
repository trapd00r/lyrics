Send "Above the Candystore" Ringtone to your Cell There is a place uptown
where you can simmer down
Cross the street above the candy store
On the second floor, down the hall behind the rugged door, I'll be there for sure.

Somewhere in Snow Cone town
follow the dragon van
Cross the street above the candystore
on the second floor, down the hall behind the rugged door, I'll be there for sure 
I'll be there for sure
I'll be there for sure
I'll be there for sure
I'll be there for sure
