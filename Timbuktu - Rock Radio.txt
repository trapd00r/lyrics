(Verse 1 : Kevin Rudolph)
I see your dirty face
High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I'm in mine

(Chorus)
Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

(Verse 2: Kevin Rudolph)
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

(Chorus)
Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

(Verse 3: Lil Wayne)
Yeah!
Wayne's world
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the top
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha
And Amanda
And Tamara (rock)
MenagÃ© moi
I'm in here up like b**** what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can d**k you up
I can d**k you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big a** rocks like off the ground
Dirty like socks thats on the ground
Weezy

(Chorus)
Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock (Oh!)

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Just Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

(Lil Wayne)
Im back like I forgot somethin'
Im somethin
Rollin' Rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll b**g ya
Period, Like the remainder

(Kevin Rudolph)
I wish I could be
As cool as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No not this time
