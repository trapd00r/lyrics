It's 4 A.M. and I'm wide awake
Waiting for my thoughts to fade
And a flickering of all of my mistakes
And as the light starts creeping in
I slowly feel the day I'm missing
But I wouldn't even know where to begin

Do I push too hard or fall too fast
The moment never seems to last
And will I stop for long enough to know

'Cause everybody burns
And when it starts to hurt
I cry
I feel it in my veins
I just can't walk away
This time

Your words circle in my head
And weigh so heavy on my chest
And I'm crushed by your expectation
I only want to do some good
Too dumb to know if I could
And I just wanna feel the days I'm in

Do I go too far, not far enough
Why can't I keep my big mouth shut?
And do we lead the life that we should?

And everybody burns
And when it starts to hurt
I cry
I feel it in my veins
I just can't walk away
This time

And did I say too much again
I'm just a girl in a panic
And if I tell you my truth
Am I getting through?
It just seems I should confess
And who am I to pretend?
This is more than I can carry

And everybody burns
And when it starts to hurt
I cry

I hold my head up high
I know I'll be alright
This time
I feel it in my veins
I just can't walk away
This time

Ah ah ah (This time)
Ah ah ah (This time)
Ah ah ah (This time)
Ah ah ah (This time)

It's 4 A.M. and I'm wide awake
Waiting for my thoughts to fade
And it's times like these I see your face
