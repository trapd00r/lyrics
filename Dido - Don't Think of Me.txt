So you're with her, and not with me, 
I hope she's sweet, and so pretty 
I hear she cooks delightfully, a little angel beside you 
So you're with her, and not with me, 
Oh how lucky one man can be 
I hear your house is smart and clean, 
Oh how lovely with your homecoming queen 
Oh how lovely it must be...

When you see her sweet smile baby, 
don't think of me 
When she lays in your warm arms, 
don't think of me 

So you're with her, and not with me, 
I know she spreads sweet honey 
In fact your best friend, 
I heard he spent last night with her 
Now how do you feel 

When you see her sweet smile baby, 
don't think of me 
When she lays in your warm arms, 
don't think of me 
And it's too late and it's too bad, 
don't think of me 
Oh it's too late and it's too bad, 
don't think of me 

Does it bother you now all the mess I made 
Does it bother you now the clothes you told me not to wear 
Does it bother you now all the angry games we played 
Does it bother you now when I'm not there 

When you see her sweet smile baby, 
don't think of me 
When she lays in your warm arms, 
don't think of me 
And it's too late and it's too bad, 
don't think of me 
Oh it's too late, oh it's too bad, 
don't think of me
