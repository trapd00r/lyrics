He couldn't believe
What his mama said
They put him in their car,
And he got scared
She looked at him
In a such painful way
Oh please mama,
Don't torture me this way

She held in close
And tears fell down
He thought of
The words she'd said
Your father is gone

Oh no, this can not be
My father would never leave me
So tell me you are joking, mama

She said he didn't suffer,
Because he was drunk
But how could she know
She wasn't there when he sunk

Oh no, this can not be
My father would never leave me
So tell me you are joking, mama

He thought
He would accept it
As time passed by
But still there are moments
When he has to cry
He feels his father
Should have been there
Through the years
But he'll always
Send him love
Through thoughts
And through years
