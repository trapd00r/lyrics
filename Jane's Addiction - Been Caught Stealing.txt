I've been caught stealing, once, when I was five
I enjoy stealing, it's just as simple as that
Well it's, just a simple fact
When I want something, man,
I don't wanna pay for it
I walk right, through the door, and I walk right through the door
Hey all right!
If I get by
It's mine,
Mine, all mine!

My girl, she's one too.
She'll go and get her a skirt, stick it under her shirt.
She grabbed a razor for me.
And she. did it, just like that. 
When she wants something, man, she don't wanna pay for it!
She'll walk right, through the door, walk right through the door.
Hey all right!
If I get by
It's mine,
Mine, all mine!
Let's go!

We sat around the pile 
We sat and laughed
We sat and laughed and waved it into the air
And we, did it, just like that
When we want something, man, 
We don't wanna pay for it
We walk right, through the door, walk right through the door.
Hey, all right!
If I get by..
It's mine,
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

It's mine.
