We just keep on Rollin' baby 

Are you ready?! 
Are you ready?!

Move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up

Breathe in, now breathe out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up

Now I know y'all be lovin' this shit right here 
L.I.M.P 
Bizkit is right here 
People in the house put them hands in the air 
'cause if you don't care, then we don't care 
See I ain't giving a fuck 
When pressing your luck 
Untouchable, branded unfuckable 
So keep me in this cage 
Until you run that mouth 
Then I might have to play 
And break the fuck out 
And then we'll see who's left 
After one round with X 
And what am I bringing next? 
Just know it's Red and Meth 
So where the fuck you at? 
Punk, shut the fuck up 
And back the fuck up 
While we fuck this track up 

Are you ready?!

Oh what, y'all thought y'all were promotion me? 
Check my dangerous slang 
Atrocious 
When I let these nuts hang 
Focus 
It's Wutang 
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish 
I wave my black flag at the roaches 
Who approach us 
These twin supersoakers 
Who have poisonous darts for copers 
Too late to get your blowgun unholsted 
You lept, light it up, and lightly toasted 
So what? 
I drink and smoke too much 
So what? 
I cut too much 
Shut the fuck the up 

Now when we roll 
You mutherfuckers turn in your gold 
Cause for the platinum 
I'm jackin' niggers up in limos 
It ain't nothin' for bullets 
To unbutton your clothes 
This wretched yellow mellow tissue 
Up in his nose 
You bitches 

Swing the vine on the bad boom nuts 
I'm hairy as hell 
Ahh to hell 
And tatooed up 
I'm a dog 
Only fuck in the bathroom, what? 
In highschool I dealt only with the classroom sluts 

My name is Johnny Donny Brasco 
Talk the gat low 
Cut your cash flow 
Yell if you want money 
Funny how hungry they'll be 
Snatch crumbs from me 
Dark and hard 
Mix bodies in the mosh pit 

Yo, and I'm the D.O. 
You're lookin' at the raw invented 
On Friday I spit 
Thirty five to forty minutes 
Smell up the bathroom 
Like Craig Paul was in it 
Ending up on your back 
Whose whore's up in it 
Anyone can match me 
I crack 'em all a Guinness 
Fuck how many thugs are playas? 
A ball is in it 
Brick city, Shaolin 
Better call 'em sinners 
Boys that'll run up in your 
White mall and spill it 

Yo, peace and come on! 

Move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breathe in, now breathe out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' 
Uggh 
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' 
What? 
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' 
Uggh 

It just don't get no darker than that 
Kid with the park 
Go ahead with the boots 
And shoots to make it spark 
Now I'm a fair nigger 
But ain't there nigger 
Quicker than the hair trigger 
Took you dead nigger 
It'd better like 
Yo man, trying to hold your breath 
In your head 
Cause you'll be shitting on yourself 
Cause you're already dead 
And at the funeral you won't need a casket 
I'm leaving just enough 
For them to stuff their basket 
But their skippin' 
Task it 
I'm gonna need my ass kicked 
My mom never let me forget 
That I'm a bastard 
I ain't never been shit 
There ain't gonna be shit 
That's why I take shit 
But if I see shit 
And to their D shit 
D Sharp 
Do what I wanna do 
And that's what I'm gonna do 
Right here in front of you 
And I'll be running you 
Wait up man, stand up out 
Yeah niggers ain't running a fuckin'' thing 
But your mouth 

Move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breathe in, now breathe out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' 
Uggh 
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' 
What? 
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin' 
Uggh 

You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit? (Yeah) 
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit (why?) 
Because we get it on (when?) 
Every day and every night (oh) 
See this platinum thing right here? (uh huh) 
Well we're doing it all the time (what?) 
So you'd better get some better beats 
And uh, get some better rhymes (d'oh!) 
And if you really really really wanna get shit started 
Then people everywhere just get retarded 
Get retarded! Get retarded!
People everywhere just get retarded! 

Move in, now move out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 
Breathe in, now breathe out 
Hands up, now hands down 
Back up, back up 
Tell me what you're gonna do now 

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
