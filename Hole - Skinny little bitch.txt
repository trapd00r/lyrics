Skinny Little Bitch
Starin' at the mirror
In your desperation to disappear.

& you would be oh so dumb to fuck with me
'Cause baby your much too young to end up with me.

Your bedrooms walls are fallin' down
& everyone can see you now
Your bedroom walls they sell for cheap
You lie, you lie alone
You lie alone
You never sleep
Oh, you never sleep.
Oh.

Skinny Little Bitch
Prayin' to the Lord
Prayin' for some salvation
'Cause she's oh so bored.

In my vile sex horror & my cheap drugs hell
I am all the things you'll never live to tell.

& you will never see the light
I'll just obscure it out of spite
Your just a nasty piece of work
Come on, come on baby
Come on baby, let it burn.
Oh, baby, does it hurt?

Born of foul creation
Born of sour milk
Cocaine filth.

You staggered here on broken glass
So I could kick your scrawny ass
All the drugs & all the burns
What a nasty, what a nasty, nasty piece of work.
Oh, baby, does it hurt?
Oh, baby, just go slower
Oh, baby, just go lower.

Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
Skinny Little Bitch.
