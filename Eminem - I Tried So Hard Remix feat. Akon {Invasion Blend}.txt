(feat. Akon)

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

[Chorus: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I tried so hard
I'll always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I tried so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me but
Until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
[Akon:]
But until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
With my heat gettin dope (gettin dope)

[Verse 1:]
(From Love me)
There's a certain mystique when I speak,
That you notice that's sorta unique,
Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,
And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,
You can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I'm strapped,
Just knowing any minute I could snap,
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped,
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically,
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry,
It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
For you to play me, it's cockamanie,
You just ain't zaney enough to rock with Shady,
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clocks cuckoo,
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kit an' kaboodle,
I'm just brutal. It's no rumour, I'm numero uno, assume it,
There's no humour in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag,
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me... bitch

[Chorus: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I tried so hard
I'll always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I tried so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me but
Until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
[Akon:]
But until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
With my heat gettin dope (gettin dope)

[Verse 2:]
(From Loose yourself)
Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's called product
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah

[Chorus: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I tried so hard
I'll always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I tried so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me but
Until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
[Akon:]
But until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
With my heat gettin dope (gettin dope)

[Verse 3:]
(From Like toy soldier)
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can't handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'...
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it I understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause

[Chorus: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man I tried so hard
I'll always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I tried so hard
Hoping one day you'll come and rescue me but
Until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
Rain, sleet, hail, snow
[Akon:]
But until then
[Bone Thugs:]
I'll be postin up right here
With my heat gettin dope (gettin dope)
