I'm so dangerous...
I'm so dangerous...

I felt that I was old, writing in this room
It's hard to understand, the things that I couldn't change
Suddenly heaven decided to show me a new sensation
I change my direction I'm ready for action
I feel dangerous

I can take it, I can make it, I'm dangerous
Can't you get it, you can't beat it, I'm fabulous
I can take it, I can make it, I'm dangerous
Can't you get it, you can't beat it 
Cus I'm so dangerous 

All the things are gone, all the waste of time
Now I'm searching for, the glory of my soul
Suddenly heaven decided to show me a new sensation
I changed my direction, I'm ready for action
I feel dangerous

I can take it, I can make it, I'm dangerous
Can't you get it, you can't beat it, I'm fabulous
I can take it, I can make it, I'm dangerous
Can't you get it, you can't beat it 
Cus I'm so dangerous..

Ahh Ahh... Im so dangerous... Ahh Ahh...

It's time to go, a taste of thrill
It's time to show what's in my face
Don't look back, don't be afraid
To volunteer could be the change 
It's time to live your life

I can take it, I can make it, I'm dangerous
Can't you get it, you can't beat it, I'm fabulous
I can take it, I can make it, I'm dangerous
Can't you get it, you can't beat it 
Cus I'm so dangerous..

I can take it, I can make it, I'm dangerous
Can't you get it, you can't beat it 
Cus I'm so dangerous
