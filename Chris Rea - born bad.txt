Take care of the way he's smiling 
You can see so easily 
The Devil's in him deep deep down 
Oh that man's got the baddest blood you'll see 
When he smiles you got to pray 
He stays that way and don't mad 
Cos there ain't no good inside him 
He was born bad 

Oh the maddest dog he fears him 
And his woman she looks so sad 
She knows he was born bad 
He was born bad 
Oh yeah he was born bad 

Don't you look for a little piece that's good 
Thinking you can't save his soul 
Don't you ever try to trust him 
Or for sure he'll take control 
And when he smiles you got to pray 
He stays that way and don't mad 
Cos there ain't no good inside him 
He was born bad 

Oh the maddest dog he fears him 
And his woman she looks so sad 
She knows he was born bad 
He was born bad 
He was born bad 

Oh the maddest dog he fears him 
And his woman she looks so sad 
She knows he was born bad 
He was born bad 
He was born bad
