Send "Werewolf" Ringtone to your Cell When the full moon shines and I am changing.
I try to talk but start to growl.
I can see my skin is turning into fur.
I'm dressed to kill and start to howl, bout to lose control, I'm a mindless soul.

Cry werewolf cry
when the beast is running wild
someone's gonna die, I am the werewolf
Cry werewolf cry
when the full moon's in the sky
you cant hear me cry, I am the werewolf.

I'm the beast that moves,
calling out the moon, I am the werewolf.

There's no excuse for what I'm doing.
Aint nothing I can't do or say.
You're always just a nature of the beast.
No one sees my pain, then gets away I'm born to slay,
Don't get in my way

Cry werewolf cry
when the beast is running wild
someone's gonna die, I am a werewolf
Cry werewolf cry
when the full moon's in the sky
you can't hear me cry, I am the werewolf.

I'm the beast that moves,
Howling at the moon

WEREWOLF
(music interlude)

Come on. (x4)

When the moon is high,
you can hear me cry and cry and cry
Then you're gonna die.

Cry werewolf cry
when the beast is running wild
someone's gonna die, I am the werewolf
Cry werewolf cry
when the full moon's in the sky
you can't hear me cry, I am the werewolf. (x2)
