Send "Animal Attraction" Ringtone to your Cell Seen you walkin'
Across the floor
You caught my eye

Dirty fishnets
Bright red lips
My favorite kind

With a look that says
Keep your distance
But not too far

Before I knew it in this spot the voices in my head I found myself inside of your car

And now...

I can't see, it's a sexual reaction
You and me, it's animal attraction
We should be in each other's arms tonight

She said dim the lights if you want some action
You and me it's animal attraction
This could be so dirty that it just ain't right

Slow it down now
The night is young and
We still got time

Call me crazy
But damn I'd like to
Get inside of your mind

But you don't have the patience for the smallest conversation that would let me know the trouble ahead

You just grab me 'round the neck and push your skirt against my jeans and say "I like to do my talking in bed"

And now...

I can't see, it's a sexual reaction
You and me, it's animal attraction
We should be in each other's arms tonight

She said dim the lights if you want some action
You and me it's animal attraction
This could be so dirty that it just ain't right

She told me..
Baby shut up now, let me put that mouth to work
She told me..
I don't wanna be your friend, so don't get those feelings hurt
She told me..
While we're sitting here wasting time we could be underneath the sheets
She told me..
Keep that story to yourself, let me show you how it's supposed to be

I can't see, it's a sexual reaction
You and me, it's animal attraction
We should be in each other's arms tonight

She said dim the lights if you want some action
You and me it's animal attraction
This could be so dirty that it just ain't right
