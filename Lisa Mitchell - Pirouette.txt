Come lay down in the water,
We're all sons and daughters,
Rest your head on the altar, oh,
Come lay down in the water

Piroutte, single step
Won't you spin me around the room,
Like a marionette?

And lonely maestro
Spin me real slow,
I just need something to get me through
The thick of it.

I have everything, from time to time (x2)

Come lay down in the water,
We're all sons and daughters,
Rest your head on the altar, oh,
Come lay down in the water

These silent offerings,
That only cowards sing,
Oh darling I was never free, for the taking

We had everything from time to time
Yeah,
We had everything (x2)

Come lay down in the water,
We're all sons and daughters,
Rest your head on the altar, oh,
Come lay down in the water

Yeah, we had everything

Come lay down in the water,
We're all sons and daughters,
In the water
