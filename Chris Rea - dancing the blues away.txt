I been to the Mississippi Delta
It's just like Middlesbrough
Warmer
lot  warmer
*****

Beat up soul, looking to find a smile
Ain't nobody here to give you the reason why
I need the wings of an Angel, need to find me a way to fly.

Come on and dance with me baby, dancing my blues away
Yeah dance with me baby, dance 'til my blues can't stay
Come on and dance with me baby, dancing my blues away.

There is something worth knowing, written behind those eyes
Well I've got tears by the truckload
Let's laugh 'til they all run dry
Let's steal the wings from those Angels
And kiss what we know goodbye -goodbye.

Come on and dance with me baby, dancing my blues away
Yeah dance with me baby, dance 'til my blues can't stay
Come on and dance with me baby
Dancing my blues away
