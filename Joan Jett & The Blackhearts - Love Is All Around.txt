Who can turn the world on with her smile?
Who can take a nothing day
and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?

Well it's you, girl, and you should know it
with each glance and every little movement you show it

Love is all around no need to fake it
You can have the town, why don't you take it
You're gonna make it after all

How will you make it on your own?
This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone
But it's time you started living
It's time you let someone else do some giving 

Love is all around no need to fake it
You can have the town, why don't you take it
You're gonna make it after all

You're the one most likely to succeed
Just be sure to keep your head, 'cause girl, you know that's all you need
Everyone around adores you
Don't give up, the world is waiting for you

Love is all around no need to waste it
You can have the town, why don't you take it
You're gonna make it after all

Who can turn the world on with her smile?
And suddenly make it all seem worthwhile
Well it's you, girl, and you should know it
with each glance and every little movement you show it

Love is all around, no need to waste it
You can have the town, why don't you take it
You're gonna make it after all
You're gonna make it after all
