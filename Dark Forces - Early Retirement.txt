Send "Psyche" Ringtone to your Cell You're alone in the pack
You're feeling like you want to go home
You're feeling unfinished but you keep on going

The reason is there
You'll be falling 'til your feet are gone
Because your living a hoax
Sell us what you suss

Draw your brain, a sick inspiration
Your pill illusion
And then you follow a transfer
If you don't know the game
Then you're still part of it
Because out on the streets
It's strange

Dodge the bullet or carry the gun
The choice is yours

Yeah! Yeah!

Look at the controller
A nazi with a social degree
A middle-class hero
Rapist with your eyes on me
You pay some masturbation
A priest cheers for the nuns you fuck
You'd wipe out spastics if you had the chance
But Jesus, Jesus
Jesus wouldn't like it, no
Jesus wouldn't like it, no
