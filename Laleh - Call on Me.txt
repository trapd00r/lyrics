You don't have to worry
If you're alone tonight
You don't have to worry
Someone's on your side
You don't have to worry
Someone in you're life
is waiting all alone
At home for you
At home for you tonight

And if you ever, ever change your mind
Call on me, call on me
And if you ever, ever change your mind
Call on me, call on me

You don't have to worry
The past is just a time
It's gone away, not here, no, no
You don't have to worry
There's a brigher light
Above us, beneath us, around us
You don't have to worry
Someone in your life
is waiting all alone
At home for you tonight

And if you ever, ever change your mind
Call on me, call on me
And if you ever, ever change your mind
Call on me, call on me

If you promise me, I'll promise you that I'll be there Until we both know our hearts Until we know how to share ...

And if you ever, ever change your mind
Call on me, call on me
