Send "C'Est la Vie" Ringtone to your Cell Got a job that's okay,
But they've got me workin' night and day.
Punchin' in, punchin' out.
Is this really what life's all about?

(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna feel?) I don't know.
(Whatcha gonna feel? Whatcha gonna do?) Won't someone tell me?
(Whatcha wanna say? Whatcha wanna do?) There's only one thing left to say
(Whatcha wanna do? Whatcha wanna say?)

C'est la vie, c'est la vie!
That's just the way it goes (that's life)
C'est la vie, c'est la vie!
That's just the way it goes (that's life)

Baby's gone, all alone
Are you sad because you're on your own?
Get back up. Party down.
There's so many good ones still around.

(Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna feel?) I don't know.
(Whatcha gonna feel? Whatcha gonna do?) Won't someone tell me?
(Whatcha wanna say? Whatcha wanna do?) There's only one thing left to say
(Whatcha wanna do? Whatcha wanna say?)

C'est la vie, c'est la vie!
That's just the way it goes (that's life)
C'est la vie, c'est la vie!
That's just the way it goes (that's life)

Hey it's J.J.! Whatyou been doin'?
You say your car broke down the thing just isn't movin'.
Say, J.J., Don't you know 
When you're down there's just one way to go
And that's singin'

C'est la vie, c'est la vie! 
That's just the way it goes (that's life)
C'est la vie, c'est la vie!
That's just the way it goes (that's life)
