It's a struggle, it's a scrape
It's all give and no take
Whatever it is now, is right up to our waist
It's a pity, it's a shame to see it all slip away
I've seen you worried babe, but never this way
We hold our ground, we don't kneel
If we go down we go
Down on our own shield

It's a river of tears
And we're in over our ears
In the dark it rides off with our better years
It's a bottomless well
It's a little overkill
It's the end of a dragon's tail
That's whipping around our heels
But we don't bow, we make no deals
If we go down we go
Down on our own shield

In this corner ladies and gentlemen
Weighing in, all along my love for her is strong
We scaled pillars to be here tonight
It's not the kind of trick that you get to pull twice

It's an ambush girl
A cold-blooded low down dirty world
See them yellow lanterns walk
A circle around our bit of earth
It's a turn for the worse
It's off with their heads if they don't learn

We do this over their dead bodies
Before it's over mine or yours
We don't beg for mercy dear
If we go down we go
Down on our own shield
