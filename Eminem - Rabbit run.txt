Verse 1:
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits,
I feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
My life's like one great big ball of shit,
If I could just put it all in to all I spit,
Instead I always try to swallow it,
Instead of staring at this wall and shit,
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit,
Can't call it shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall,
If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
This is it, last straw, that?s all, that?s it, 
I ain't dealing with another fucking politic,
I'm like a skillet bubbling, till it filters up,
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up,
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
My cup run'ith over I've done and filled it up,
The pen explodes and busts and ink spills my guts,
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
But I'm a show you, what, you gonna feel my rush,
You dont feel it then it must be to real to touch,
Build a dutch, I'm about to tear shit up,
Goosebumps, yeah I'm a make your hair sit up,
Yeah sit up, I'm a tell you who I be,
I'm a make you hate me cause you ain't me,
You wait, it ain't to late to finally see,
What you close minded fucks were to blind to see,
Whoever finds me, is gonna get a finders fee,
Out this world and ain't no one out their mind as me,
You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine,
All I need's a line but sometimes,
I dont always find the words to rhyme,
To express how i'm really feeling at that time,
Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, just sometimes,
It's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3,
This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
I'm desperate at my desk if I could just get the rest,
Of this shit off my chest, again, stuck in this slump,
Can't think of nothing, fuck I'm stumped,
But wait here comes something,
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,
Crinkle it up and throw that shit out,
I'm fizzling now thought I had figured it out,
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
But I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade,
Sionide I'll spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want,
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain?t a quitter,
I'm a sit here till I get enough,
For me to finally hit a fucking boiling point,
Put some oil in your joints,
Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed,
An MC's worst dream I make them tense they hate me,
See me and shake like a chain-link fence,
By the looks of them you would swear Jaws was coming,
By the scream of them you would swear i'm sawing someone,
By the way they running you would swear the law was coming,
It's now or never and tonight It's all or nothing,
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back,
He pinky promised, I dont think he's honest,
I be back baby I just got to beat this clock,
Fuck this clock, I'm a make them eat this watch,
Don't believe me watch, I'm a win this race,
and I'm a come back and rub my shit in your face,
Bitch, I found my niche, you gonna hear my voice,
Till you sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice,
If I gotta scream till I have half a lung,
If I have half a chance I grab it, rabbit run.
