Just when the days start getting colder 
I walk the streets I never knew 
And theres some words I never told you 
The sound rings out like the truth 

And if you could see 
What's come over me 
Then you would know 
Cause I'm walkin' free 
The wind at my back 
Bathed in afterglow 

And as I sit here in this dark room 
All I seem to feel is light 
And I see color 
I see the maroon 
In the blood of this life that's ours 

And if you could see 
What's come over me 
Then you would know 
Cause I'm walkin' free 
The wind at my back 
Bathed in after-- 

Watch the sun, it paints an orange sky 
Lay me down, and feel the day has gone by 

Just when the day 
Just when the day 
Oh, oh 

Just when the days start getting longer 
I walk the streets I never knew 
And the sun comes out for you 

And if you could see 
What's come over me 
Then you would know 
Cause I'm walkin' free 
The wind at my back 
Bathed in after-- 

Cause I'm walkin' free 
The wind at my back 
Bathed in afterglow, oh, oh
