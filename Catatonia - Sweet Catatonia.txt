Intro:
Chance dreams that cut across the bed, leaving colours there instead
See lines that draw it to an end - ignore them
And if I say how I feel again, is it wise to do it?
Or like hearing for the umpteenth time, some despise
Don't you fall asleep there's lots of things I need to say that just won't keep
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
And with my fears in the back of my mind, will they gang up on me?
And when I least expect them to they'll devour me
Don't you turn aside, your tired ears must hear me out - there's nowhere to hide
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
Don't you turn aside, your tired ears must hear me out - there's nowhere to 
hide
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
(And with my fears in the back of my mind, will they gang up on me?)
Sweet sweet sweet sweet catatonia, I should have told you (ah ah)
(And when I least expect them to they'll devour me)
