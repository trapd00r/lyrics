I don't stop breathing every time the phone rings
My heart don't race when someones at my door
I've almost given up thinkin' your ever gonna call
I don't believe in magic anymore.

I just don't lie awake at night
Asking God to get you off my mind
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time.

Yeah, I got to work on time again this morning
This old job is all that I got left
And no one even noticed I'd been crying
At least I don't have whisky on my breath.

Yeah, I think I'm gonna make it
'Cause God won't make a mountain I can't climb
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time.

God, I hope your happy
Girl, I wish you well
I just might get over you
You can't ever tell.

I always thought that I'd do something crazy
If ever saw you out with someone else
But when the moment came last night
I couldn't say a word, I stood there in the dark all by myself.

Yeah, I could of said a million things
All I did was keep it locked inside
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time.

It's getting better all the time...
