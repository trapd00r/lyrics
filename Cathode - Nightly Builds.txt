Send "Lady in Black" Ringtone to your Cell On a magical misty morning
I was standing in the Autumn rain
Suddenly the birds fell silent
Would I ever hear them sing again...
Hear them sing again...

Without a word of warning
I saw a shadow in the Autumn rain
Just like in my nightly dreams
The Lady In Black had come again...
The Lady had come again...

Begging me to follow her into the misty rain
Begging me to follow her into the no more pain

Her eyes were hypnotizing
Burning deep inside my brain
The Lady In Black was here now
She was here to take me far away...
Take me far away...

"Follow me to the other side"

Through the tunnel of light we travel, fading away
Through the tunnel of light we travel
We're fading away

Through the light that's shining bright
We're fading away
Through the light that's shining bright
We're fading away
