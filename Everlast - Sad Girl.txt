I seen her at a stoplight on Alverano
Was sittin in a pearl white Eldorado
In a gangsta lean she was revvin' the throttle
Got a sticker on the bumper say she like techano
She looked like Selena
The truth couldn't be plainer
She like a gangster boogie
Her mommy calls her cookie

My friends call her a sad girl 
'coz her man went away 
and he ain't never comin' back 
So cry a another tattoo sea

Sad girl livin' on the east side of the city
Proud woman boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on

I seen her at the market she was pushin' a stroller
Smokin' on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda
Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her
Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder
She looked like an angel
She talked like the devil
She looked like a stranger
She lived like a rebel

My friends call her a sad girl 
'coz her man went away 
and he ain't never comin' back 
So cry a another tattoo sea

Sad girl livin' on the east side of the city
Proud woman boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on

Face that girl we can take this slow
Baby what you looken for? Let me know.
You say you want a man that can give you some dough
You say buy my baby shoes and maybe buy him a coat
and buy my baby food to put down his throat
I won't play you like a hoe, it ain't like that yo
Let me holla at you later, we can go to the show
I aint tryna rock the boat I'm tryna keep you afloat

I seen her at the post office mailin' a letter
She couldn't send no money but she made him a sweater
She's talkin' on the pay phone and somethin' upset her
I really wanna hold her but I only just met her
But I could tell she'd been crying
She said she felt like dyin'
She never been so alone, no
She gotta make it on her own now

She's a sad girl 'coz her man went away and he ain't never comin' back

Sad girl livin' on the east side of the city
Proud woman boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on
Sad girl
sad girl
sad girl
sad girl
sad girl
sad girl
sad girl
