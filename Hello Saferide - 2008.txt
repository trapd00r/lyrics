There is a war in all the heads and there's a war 
in mine as well and if I could explain it any 
better, I'm sure I would. 

We're in a bus and it's night, you opened up and 
so will I but though I'm good with words I've 
never been good with... words. 

But all I know is: there's something new this year. 
All I know is: there's something new real near. 
 
There is a town that I live in and it's a town that 
favors winners and when I win I think about 
when I'll next lose. 

I took a train that took me north, and it's the 
place where trees speak louder than the people, 
but if I have to pick that's what I'll choose. 

I walked along the river Ume, it chilled me out 
of my bones too, but a cold wind is always 
better than a cold voice. I am not strong enough 
for win city, I'll stay in to play Sin, witty people 
without hearts have always had a lead on me.

And all I know is: there's something new this year. 
All I know is:  there's something new real near. 
All I know is: there's something new this year. 
I don't know much, but there's something new 
coming near. 

I'll walk into the shop where you work, it is a 
shop that kills you slowly, there'll be no blood 
but another shirt on a hanger will still behead 
you. I'll lift your arm and you'll lift mine, and in 
a Communist state of mind, we're not worth 
more than anyone else but surely not worth less.
