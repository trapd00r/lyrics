There was a mistake under the weather,
One shout's gonna turn into another.
It's a heartbreak under the weather,
Standing out in the cold.

Highway is frightning.
Rain hammering on your window.
I hate sheet lightning.
You reach for the telephone.

[ chorus ]

Mistake under the weather,
One shout's gonna turn into another.
It's a heartbreak under the weather,
Standing out in the cold.

I pray for blue skies,
Rain hammering on your window.
On your way you wonder why
You're spending on your own.

[ repeat chorus ]

And talking on the radio,
You never know how to say
Anything's a plan that could be on your mind,
It could vanish in a tragical way.
Get lost in dreaming.
Rain hammering on your window,
Try to catch the meaning.


You're dancing on your own.

[ repeat chorus ]

And talking on the radio,
You never know how to say
Anything's a plan that could be on your mind,
It could vanish in a tragical way.

(hammering)

(meaning)

There was a mistake under the weather,
One shout's gonna turn into another.
It's a heartbreak under the weather,
Standing out in the cold.

It was a mistake under the weather,
One shout's gonna turn into another.
It's a heartbreak under the weather,
Standing out in the cold.

There was a mistake under the weather,
One shout's gonna turn into another.
It's a heartbreak under the weather,
Standing out in the cold.

It was a mistake!
