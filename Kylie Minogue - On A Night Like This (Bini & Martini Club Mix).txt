Don't, say
It's like a fantasy
When, you
Know this is how it should be

You kiss me, I'm falling
Can you hear me calling?
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever, stay forever
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Now, I'm
Getting closer to you
Hold, me
I just can't be without you

You kiss me, I'm falling
It's your name I'm calling
You touch me, I want you
Feels like I've always known you

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever, stay forever
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

Seams I've known you a lifetime
Now it's time to make you mine
On a night like this
On a night like this

You kiss me, I'm falling
You touch me
On a night like this
Just wanna be together

On a night like this
I wanna stay forever, stay forever
On a night like this
Just wanna be together
On a night like this

You kiss me, I'm falling
You touch me
On a night like this
You kiss me, I'm falling
You touch me
On a night like this
