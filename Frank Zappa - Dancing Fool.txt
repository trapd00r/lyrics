Send "Dancing Fool" Ringtone to your Cell Don't know much about dancin' 
That's why I got this song 
One of my legs is shorter than the other 
'N' both my feet's too long 
'Course now right along with 'em 
I got no natural rhythm 
But I go dancin' every night 
Hopin' one day I might get it right 
I'm a dancin' fool, I'm a 
Dancin' fool 
I hear that beat; I jump outa my seat, 
But I can't compete, 'cause I'm a 
Dancin' fool, I'm a 
Dancin' fool 

The disco folks all dressed up 
Like they's fit to kill 
I walk on in 'n' see 'em there 
Gonna give them all a thrill 
When they see me comin' 
They all steps aside 
They has a fit while I commit 
My social suicide, I'm a 
Dancin' fool, I'm a 
Dancin' fool 
The beat goes on 
And I'm so wrong 
The beat goes on 
And I'm so wrong 
The beat goes on 'n' I'm so wrong 
The beat goes on 'n' I'm so wrong 
The beat goes on 'n' I'm so wrong 
I may be totally wrong, but I'm a 
Dancin' fool, I'm a 
Dancin' fool 
Youwsa, youwsa, youwsa 
I got it all together now 
With my very own disco clothes, hey! 
My shirt's half open, t'show you my chains 
'N' the spoon for up my nose 
I am really somethin' 
That's what you'd prob'ly say 
So smoke your little smoke 
Drink your little drink 
While I dance the night away, I'm a 
Dancin' fool, I'm a 
Dancin' fool, (etc., etc.) 

I may be totally wrong, but I'm a 
I may be totally wrong, but I'm a 
I may be totally wrong, but I'm a 
FOOL-uh! 

Hey darlin'...can I buy ya a drink? 
Lookin' for Mister Goodbar? Here he is... 
Wait a minute...I've got it...You're an Italian! 
Hah?

Love your nails...you must be a Libra... 
Your place or mine?
