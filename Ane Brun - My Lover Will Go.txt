What am I going to do
I am crying a bottle of wine over you
This is something I don't usually do
But I'm crying a bottle of wine over you

For me it is red or nothing 
Hey ho my lover will go
And this will ruin everything 
Hey ho my lover will go
I'm just too romantic
Hey ho my lover will go
Without any sense of strategies 
Hey ho my lover will go, oh oh

Twelve days and many long nights have passed
Since I let go of my heart way to fast 
Too many long summer nights 
I've been checking for errors on the telephone lines

For me it is red or nothing 
Hey ho my lover will go
And this will ruin everything 
Hey ho my lover will go
I'm just too romantic
Hey ho my lover will go
Without any sense of strategies 
Hey ho my lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh

What am I gonna do
I am pouring my heart all over you
I guess I recognize this too 
I think I'm falling in love with you

For me it is red or nothing 
Hey ho my lover will go
And this will ruin everything 
Hey ho my lover will go
I'm just too romantic
Hey ho my lover will go
Without any sense of strategies 
Hey ho my lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh
My lover will go, oh oh
