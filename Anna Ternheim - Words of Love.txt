Words of love sent by you
Any way you get them through
Words of love trouble me
Feels like someone's watching me

Loving hands around my throat
Bob what are you speaking of?
Sounds like panic in my head
Tie the strings and i play dead

All around me
Speak about you
Always find me
And remind me of you

I've erased every line you wrote
Words you stole, my quotes of love
Paper pins over flow
In my head and on my floor

Words of love
Words of love

All around me
Speak about you
Always find me
To remind me of you
To remind me of you
