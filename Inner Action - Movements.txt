When tears of wrath turn to strength again
The words burn holes in the prison walls
And black rays of light pierce through
Substantiate themselves to the inner being
Lacking eyes, but the shadows in the holes can
See and attract the attention of fears
Turning thought into action
In perspective-twisting movements
Loosing substance,
Anything but escaping...
We have forgotten the true face of resistance
Nothing to grasp
Protest losing it's meaning
The bitter laugh of desperation echoes
Between the walls of my soul
Walking the same unforgivable path
No way to stop this from happening
Don't regret and refuse to change
