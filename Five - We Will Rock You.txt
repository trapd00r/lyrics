Were causin utter devastation
When were stepping to the place
And better believe that you can see
Were gonna rock and never stop
And here we go again
Hit you with the flow again
Kick it up the second time around
Well bring it on again - shout it out

Buddy youre a boy
Make a big noise playin in the street
Gonna be a big man some day
You got blood on your face, big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place
(singing)

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

How about little something to get you in the mood
Know what I mean? 
Watch your back, we got queen on this track
Bring the feedback, and let it drop
As long as five bring the funk
Queen bring the rock
And it dont stop

Buddy youre a young man
Hard man, shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on your face, big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place
(singing)

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

Buddy youre an old man, poor man pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you something some day
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back in your place
(singing)

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
