Who said we are lost again
In this lonely world?
I say we can start again
We're on the same ship
It's called Starship Earth

It is not too late
It's our home, so
Don't say that it's fate
We must not give up
To build our future
On our dreams

We will never lie down and die
But we'll find a way to survive
We all have somebody we love
We know that's why we're here

We battle for freedom
It is a battle against the dark
I have my dreams
You know I'm not afraid of being
In the top

We battle for tomorrow
It is a battle against time
And we can do miracles
So take my hand
We need to save this world

It was a hard time
So many tears, and
Some died for nothing
To give up is not a choice
It's a fight we have to win

I cannot live without faith
Even if I am faced with death
We all have somebody we love
We know that's why we're here

We battle for freedom
It is a battle against the dark
We all have dreams
And each of them is to be realized
In their time

We battle for tomorrow
It is a battle against time
Too many tears have been shed
But don't save fear
We need to save this world

We will never lie down and die
But we'll find a way to survive
We all have somebody we love
We know that's why we're here

We battle for freedom
It is a battle against the dark
I have my dreams
You know I'm not afraid of being
In the top

We battle for tomorrow
It is a battle against time
And we can do miracles
So take my hand
We need to save this world
