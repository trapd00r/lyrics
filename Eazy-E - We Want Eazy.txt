"We want eazy!"

(Dr. Dre)
Yeah, yeah.
Can y'all hear that? Yeah!
Can y'all hear that? Yeah!
Well, clap ya hands then-come on
Clap ya hands-everybody
Clap ya hands, come on, come on
Put ya hands together and clap 'em
Now can y'all say Eazy?
Come on, say it

EAZ-Y
Everybody come on,
EAZ-Y
Who'd y'all come to see?
EAZ-Y
A little louder come on!
EAZ-Y
Get those hands in the air!
EAZ-Y
Come on, come on-say it!
EAZ-Y
A little louder come on!
EAZ-Y
Come on make some noise!
EAZ-Y
Hey yo Ren, lets do this...


(MC Ren)
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope styles
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say?

(Eazy-e)
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set
Hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal
Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless
When I spot a sucka, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y
Everybody come on!
EAZ-Y
A little louder say it!
EAZ-Y
Come on say it, say it, say it!
EAZ-Y
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
EAZ-Y
Who'd y'all come to see?
EAZ-Y
A little louder come on!
EAZ-Y
Come on, come on, come on,come on, come on!
EAZ-Y
Hey yo Yella boy, take me to da bridge!

Eazy
Hey eazy
Wassup??
Why you wear your pants like that?
I wear my pants like this, fo' easy access baby
Yeah thats right

(Ice Cube)
Yo homeboy, where we takin' this jam to?
COMPTON
Where?
COMPTON
Alright

(Eazy-e)
Now I wanna know who y'all came to see?

EAZ-Y
Everybody in the house!
EAZ-Y
Come on say EAZY, come on!
EAZ-Y
Say it, say it, say it, say it!
EAZ-Y
Come on everybody-come on!
EAZ-Y
I can't hear you!
EAZ-Y
Everybody come on-say it!
EAZ-Y
Who'd y'all come to see?
EAZ-Y
Yo Eazy, kick another verse

(Eazy-e)
Yeah 'cuz this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nuthin' can avoid this shot 'cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

(Dr. Dre)
EAZ-Y
Y'all know what time it is!
EAZ-Y
Come on, y'all gotta get mo' hyped up then that!
EAZ-Y
Come on-say it, say it, say it!
EAZ-E
Do it, do it, do it, do it,do it!
EAZ-Y
Get those hands back in the air!
EAZ-Y
Come on,come on, come on!
EAZ-Y
Who'd y'all come to see?
EAZ-Y
Take me back to the bridge, I like that part!

Yo man, you weren't born in no '73
Why you be lyin' bout your age?
(Eazy-E)
Man, why you gotta bring that up?
Yo, get this fool outta here!

(Eazy-E)
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy duz it

EAZ-Y
We want Eazy...
