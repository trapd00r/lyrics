Send "Storm (feat. Edan & Mr. Lif)" Ringtone to your Cell its crazy in here
we take you now to the satalite
you want action, storm the studio

EDAN - crush, kill, mutilate, spill, 
blood, thud, the limb body is a thug,
flood scarlett, protoplasmic cells, flow, slow, 
with no halo, dragon in hell
stay low key, praise, elohims
Melodies, play hellish strength, M-O-G
I see radios through the M-I-C when I speak to ya,
When I cease, When I leave, through the exit 
the question is can I be, Smoother, 
choose you maneuver to Buddah,
be beautiful sooner first, 
get in tune with the Universe,
versatility add activity (?)
captivity, energy through seafood,
gotta be the prelude to what we do kid,
my blueprint makes you rent tuxedo's,
taggin' & raggin' & baggin', zig-zaggin',
and back in the diagonal crush of bun b-lo,
trust me though, you fuckin' with the lux regal,
what mud evil can clutch the untouched eagle?
see you at the summit, you plummet more,
while I soar through the unexplored,
toured where the sun goes warm,
paramore, I perform through a storm,
My radioactive uniform leaves you deformed,
unify man, woman and little guy,
visualize, I can design rhymes that symbolize,
rhymes that intertwine with timelines for 99 lifetimes,
that unwhine to find the minds of mankind to shine 
define symaly,
simulate the template of the best made verse,
innuate to emulate words,
don't denigrate the trade, reate birth
the unification of race as that verse was clashin'
oppression in murderous fashion,
bread new plants, virtuous craftsmen,
the seamen's in the sand, you see 'em from the air
fu manchu pants had a verbal assassin

Mr. Lif - I settle all things through a megaphone
I spit transmit landsplit sanchez
another grip by lif, thats M-R to the L-I
leave n***as near far for rippin' tongues soft
searchin' for the center of ya frame, just copy
got no blood, your arteries left soft
hot of the presses, yeses, the EPs'll bless us
strifes and stresses, various points infiltrate us
laps collapse cells within the cause of contrast
first, worst, anything reacts for tracks
all your personal facts 'till ya backtrack
and guess your illiterate who gets stomped and laughed at
so primitive, (?) a figurative 
phrase from back in the days I use to the little kids
amplest mental midgets, with ten digits
a poseable thumb don't mean you can get dub
officially its only my mind that limits me
and lately Ive been havin' visions of infinity
I'm the horizon, apple prizin' when my tales be survivin'
with me sur-rhymin', some murderers were left silient
those who spoke choked on hope, threw up
so much pressure in their cell 'till their dome blew up
I'm helpin' the hell boy, the piles compose my frame
and they'll even diss a pain through range
train the ladder, my flows compose the louder 
for you to ripple down 'till you hit the ground
check my synopsis, ripped by clyclopsis 
autopsy deemed trite trite from lobby's
sloppy's 'ol cases, your flow fold by four places
mold the globe's oasis
history's a myth to me, the current is electricity
an ankle that'll start and dangle there
physically swivel maybe talk to T La Rock
so give up and put down the Mic 
and admit that youre soft and get DONE
