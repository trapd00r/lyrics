I woke up so sad one morning
And there were reasons
for that bad morning
Something told me
you're not ready for this change

I got up stepped into the
shower, and I thought:
it will be gone
about an hour or so

But something told me
this feeling comes from
deep inside
And suddenly ran teardrops,
just like the water
And I lost, I lost the fight
And it felt like someone
had died away from me
And myself died a thousand times

Have I lost my sence and strength
Are my eyes just full of you
Why come the pictures
reminding me of love
Suddenly ran teardrops,
just like the water
And I lost, I lost the fight
And it felt like someone
had died away from me
And myself died a thousand times
