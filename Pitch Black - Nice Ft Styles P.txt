[Jadakiss]
they must got a death wish
they was on the road to the riches back in the day they got off on the exit
trill disrespect shit
whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment
its hard to digest it
young niggas don’t want to get punched in they faces
so they keep the burner on, to catch a bunch of cases
these old niggas still think they livin’ in the ’80s
the shawties they knew since they were babies turn crazy
the bitches still holla at anybody
lookin’ like they have a couple dollars
fuck suck and swallow
ain’t nobody winnin’ but everybody can’t lose
dirts still there funeral home ain’t move
going in coming out gang affiliated
rather go back before being humiliated
a black cloud over the hood you can’t escape it
dust smokin’ niggas walk around in the matrix
loyalty is thin, tension is thick
look at a broke nigga’s face when you mention a brick
stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
cans of lizzle get lit, when you get hit with a fifth
niggas they used to hoop dreamin’ is now sellin’ the piff
and they still rattin’ but you can’t tell if you stiff
especially when the tek spit, fuck around get your head and your neck hit
lookin’ for a death wish, walk

[Chorus - Jadakiss]
talkin’ out your mouth
all wreckless to a nigga that you know
that’ll let it off
that’s a death wish
when your heart stops and your body gets breathless
and help don’t come in enough time
that’s a death wish
when you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
and don’t know where it came from
that’s a death wish
when you know a nigga whole style’s on select shit
(young money)when you violate ‘em, fwah
that’s a death wish

[Lil Wayne]
on that way left shit
better get right or get left shit
better hit right or get left, hit
even if you threw the best pitch
yes bitch
its Weezy F. Bitch
I’m the best, bitch
muthafuck your guest list
I’ll be like let’s just kill ‘em
and get breakfast
neck slit, neck shit expect this
everytime you check this
I’m exit I mean excited to be your death wish
bitch I wear this G-shit on my heart not my necklace
and I keep the Heckler for the hecklers
and I’m from the mecca of the wreckless
with a record-breaking debt list
the wreckers and neglectors think the election won’t affect us
I’m high above you above law above average
niggas snitchin puttin niggas in the can like a beverage
damn
I pop out your head fuck up your memories
I’ll put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
yea
you still don’t remember shit
you gon’ remember this
I’m knockin’ niggas down this year
I’m on my timber shit
big lion growl at you niggas on that simba shit
I be on that fuck yo clique I kill every member shit
cool as December shit
bang in any weather shit
and they can buy your bag but the parts sold separate
yea thats a bad bitch
like Russian roulette bitch
Weezy be the genie in the bottle here’s your death wish

[Chorus - Jadakiss]
talkin’ out your mouth
all wreckless to a nigga that you know
that’ll let it off
that’s a death wish
when your heart stops and your body gets breathless
and help don’t come in enough time
that’s a death wish
when you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
and don’t know where it came from
that’s a death wish
when you know a nigga whole style’s on select shit
(young money)when you violate ‘em, fwah
that’s a death wish
