(Music starts)

Oh yeah
I'll I
I'll I 
I'll never stop 

I don't know 
Do you believe me?
After all that's said and done
All the lies 
How I regret them baby now 
I am the loser 
And you're shining like the sun 
Tell me why can't I still be the one?
Alright 

Chorus: 
I will never stop, until you're mine 
I can wait forever till the end of time 
Cause my heart is in your hands 
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop 

I'll never stop 

How could I ever 
When my heart is in your hands? 
And I know 
Baby there is no turning back 
They say that I'm crazy
And I kind of understand
How I wish for this nightmare to end 
Oh yeah 

I will never stop until you're mine
I can wait forever till the time 
Cuz my heart is your hands 
Don't you understand?
I'll never stop

yeaa 
I'll never stop 

ooo ooo ooo  

Do you believe me 
When your heart is in your hands? 
Don't you understand? 
I will never stop (I'll never stop) 
Till the end of time (I can wait forever) 
My heart is, in your, hand (My heart is in your hand) 
I will never stop 
Until you're mine 
I can wait forever till the end of time 
Cause my heart is in your hands
Don't you understand? 
I'll never stop
