Born into a scene
Of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen
My dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be

Now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
Going to find my man
Gonna travel 'round

So long wrathchild
Yeah I'm a wrathchild
Hello wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeah

Some say it shouldn't matter
Ain't nothing gonna alter
The course of my destination
But I know I've gotta find
Some serious peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy

Now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him
I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm going to find my man
Gonna travel 'round

'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah wrathchild
I'm comin' to get you
Ooh yeah, yeah

Yeah
