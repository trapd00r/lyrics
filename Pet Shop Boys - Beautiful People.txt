City life just leaves me weak
All this madness on the street
Need to get away today
Live my life a different way
Is it only fantasy to dream about a perfect me?

I wanna live like beautiful people
Give like beautiful people
With like beautiful people around
I wanna live like beautiful people
Give like beautiful people
With like beautiful people around

Buy the latest magazine
And aspire to the dream
Perfect home and perfect kids
Not a life lived on the skids
Is it only fantasy or could it be reality?

I wanna live like beautiful people
Give like beautiful people
With like beautiful people around
I wanna live like beautiful people
Give like beautiful people
With like beautiful people around

Now I can see myself without a care in the world
It's a sun shining, money-spending, green and healthy world
Is it only fantasy or could it be reality?

I wanna live like beautiful people
Give like beautiful people
With like beautiful people around
I wanna live like beautiful people
Give like beautiful people
With like beautiful people around
