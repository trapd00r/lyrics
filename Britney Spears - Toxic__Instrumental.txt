Baby can't you see I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous I'm falling

There's no escape I can't wait 
I need a hit baby give me it
Your dangerous I'm lovin' it

Too high can't come down
Losing my head spinning round and round
Do ya feel me now?

Oh the a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride 
Your toxic I'm slippin' under (oh oh)
With a the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't ya know that you're toxic
And I love what ya do
Don't ya know that you're toxic

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly it's taking over me

Too high can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can ya feel me now?

Oh the a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride 
Your toxic I'm slippin' under (oh oh)
With a the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't ya know that you're toxic
And I love what ya do
Don't ya know that you're toxic
Don't ya know that you're toxic

Ahh ahh ahh ahh 
Haa ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh 

Taste of your lips and having fun

Your toxic I'm slippin' under (oh oh)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't ya know that you're toxic

Oh the a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride 
Your toxic I'm slippin' under (toxic oh oh)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't ya know that you're toxic

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now
With your loving now
I think I'm ready now
