I let her go
Gone gone gone black widow
I let her go
Gone gone gone in a dying meadow

I just opened up my window
No need to argue
If she's going

I let her go
Gone gone gone in the deep slumber
Gone gone gone as ice melted in summer

I just opened up my window
No need to argue
Lay my head against my pillow
No need to follow
If she's going
