Unholy alliance, science and the occult
A world war legend still waiting to unfold
A military industry in underground death factories
Produce more and more esoteric weapons of war
Clandestine operations
Inhumane experimentations
Treading unknown paths, explore the bizarre
Twist the tide, reverse the fortune of war
Unnatural sightings, mysterious lights
Dark secrets of the reich
The legacy of the black sun
Burning bright in the sky
Are they lying in wait beneath the polar ice
Or hiding in the dark side of the moon
Over 60 years have passed, legend remain unsolved
As the war was lost they took their secrets to the grave
Will they emerge from the shadow
Vengeance and victory, rise to power once more
