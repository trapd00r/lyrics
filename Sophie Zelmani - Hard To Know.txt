I ain't here for fun
Can't be moved around
Maybe that means I can't
Give you a good time

I could spend my time
Looking at you
But as long as you're striving
I've got to do that too

Hard for you to know
I'm dripping of love
Hard to defend
I'm only dreaming of love

I'm not here to make
My voice heard
Maybe that makes me smaller
In this world

I could spend my time
Wishing I was like you
But if you think my life
Looks alright, i'll think so too
