Cut me up today
I Should've stood in your way
He lied

And everywhere a dream
Nothing came between 
I died

Cut me away
I will not be for you
God comes down

Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same

And if you wanted water
And if you wanted food
If you want shelter 
I cannot come over to you

And if you want loove now
Or the needle and the spoon
You gotta show a little faith in me now, baby
I cant come over to you

Never gonna be the same
Never gonna be the same
God come on down

And if you want my heart out
Sittin by the bay
Well the sun went down tomorow
It will not come up today

And if you want my love now
And wrapped your arms so cruel
If theres a god its me now, baby
I cannot come over to you

Never gonna be the same
Just put me in your way
She lied

You gotta show a little faith
In your old rugged cross you made
What comes up it must go down
And down and down you cried

And if I wanted fame now
Or the glory of the womb
And if I wanted my name in places
Ill never lie to you

And if I wanted christ
Or a messiah by my side
I cant believe in anything
I know that Mary lied

I sent you up today
Couldve got in your way
Oh, Mary lied

Do you know?
Can you feel it?
Do you feel me?

And if you wanted madness
If you want whats pure
Well  you gotta come over to me,baby
My light doesnt reach you

If you want a love
So unconditional and real
Youve gotta ride that black horse, baby
Through the depths of Hell that Ive been
Follow me away
Yeah though I walk

I will be the same
The strongest one thats made
Through the valley of life

Never gonna be the same
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
You'll never be the same.
