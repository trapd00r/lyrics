So this is what it feel to breathe
Just one more taste then it starts to leave
Then rolls and swings just like the trees then it's gone.
If this is what we're fighting for
Not a single word went out that door
I've seen that look in her eyes before
Then it's... gone, not again

As the tears runs down her face
And this boy is left to blame
I'd rather be a million miles away
All the pieces fall in place
Still I dare not walk away
I'd rather be a million miles away

You took away the best of me
And left me with no room to see
That nothings ever as we dream
We were wrong
Control this endless flow of tears
This place will be alone for year
It's focused on my inner fears and grows... strong again

As the tears runs down her face
And this boy is left to blame
I'd rather be a million miles away
All the pieces fall in place
Still I dare not walk away
I'd rather be a million miles away

In another time and place
Far out gone this cold enbrace
I will find my space
A million miles away

As the tears runs down her face
And this boy is left to blame
I'd rather be a million miles away
All the pieces fall in place
Still I dare not walk away
I'd rather be a million miles away
