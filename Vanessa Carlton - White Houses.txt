Crashed on the floor when I moved in 
This little bungalow with some strange new friends
Stay up too late, and I'm too thin 
We promise each other it's till the end 
Now we're spinning empty bottles 
It's the five of us 
With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust
I can't resist the day 
No, I can't resist the day 

Jenny screams out and it's no pose
'Cause when she dances she goes and goes
Beer through the nose on an inside joke 
I'm so excited, I haven't spoken 
And she's so pretty, and she's so sure
Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her
The summer's all in bloom 
The summer is ending soon 

It's alright and it's nice not to be so alone
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses 

Maybe I'm a little bit over my head
I come undone at the things he said 
And he's so funny in his bright red shirt
We were all in love and we all got hurt 
I sneak into his car's cracked leather seat 
The smell of gasoline in the summer heat 
Boy, we're going way too fast 
It's all too sweet to last 

It's alright
And I put myself in his hands
But I hold on to your secrets in white houses
Love, or something ignites in my veins 
And I pray it never fades in white houses 

My first time, hard to explain
Rush of blood, oh, and a little bit of pain
On a cloudy day, it's more common than you think
He's my first mistake 

Maybe you were all faster than me
We gave each other up so easily 
These silly little wounds will never mend
I feel so far from where I've been 
So I go, and I will not be back here again
I'm gone as the day is fading on white houses 
I lie, wrote my injuries all in the dust 
In my heart it's the five of us 
In white houses 

And you, maybe you'll remember me
What I gave is yours to keep 
In white houses 
In white houses 
In white houses
