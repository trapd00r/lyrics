Send "The Red Room of the Rising Sun" Ringtone to your Cell [BIlly to Jesse] 
We are the lost of timeless   
Hazes never found 
We walk the new rays of the rising sun 
In here’s a heaven where no pain is found 

[Jesse to Billy]
Take away the pain of life for me 
Take me where I’m numb 
Take me tripping to the light I see 
With magic colors of the rising sun 
 
[Billy to Jesse] 
In here are the doors of blindness 
Trails of rainbows round 
Lost asylums of forgotten sons 
Will you rise up will you touch your God. 
The sky’s slip into the rising seas 
And drown your Neon One 
Come touch the faces of the Gods you seek 
In the Red Room of the Rising Sun  

[Jesse to Billy] 
Is there love to save me 
Or just illusion 
Is there none to claim me 
Just delusion  

[BIlly to Jesse] 
Open the doors to your mind 
And hide in your dreams 
The Red Room is laughing 
The Red Sun is happy 
Close the holes here inside 
Don’t believe all you think 
The Red Room is crying 
The Red Sun is rising 
Hold on, hold on 
Touch the faces of God and roll on 
Into the Red Room 
And free your Neon One 
    
Hold on, can you roll on 
Fly the haze’s along 
Into the Rising Sun 
And feel your Neon love 
Hold on, can you hold on 
Oh – can you feel it shining 
See it rising with the sun 
    
Hold on, can you hold on 
Oh – can you feel shining 
See it rising 
With this love
