ItÂ´s dawn
The crack of dawn
A saxophone, an armchair, and a small drum

Sunrise, all smiles
It's crack of dawn by the Fyris River
Spring morning
We're singing
The grass is wet from dew
And me and you from wine too
Keeping our feet up
Keeping our feet up
In one armchair by the Fyris River

Sleeping three people in
One armchair by the Fyris River
Sleeping three people in
One armchair by the Fyris River

It's dawn
The crack of dawn
A saxophone, an armchair and a small drum
People passing by
The grass is almost dry
We're sleeping by the Fyris River

Sleeping three people in
One armchair by the Fyris River
Sleeping three people in
One armchair by the Fyris River
