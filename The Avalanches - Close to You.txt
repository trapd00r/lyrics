Here we come, we got funk, (Repeat)
Somebody, somewhere, sex with me,
Here.. here we come, we got funk X2

Next to me... X6

The disco... the disco... the disco... that's gotta be right, X4
That's gotta be right, down to the midnight, to start
Down to the disco... the disco... the disco,
Down to the midnight, the start to the midnight, start to the midnight,
That's gotta be right

There's a tense young man that's goin' round, turnin' the joint, outside down, (Repeat)
Down to the disco...,
Start to the midnight, down to the disco...,
Down to the disco...
