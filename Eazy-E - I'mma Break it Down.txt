My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
takin' out profanity so they can play it though
listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
going to the record store say ya gonna buy
that the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
so that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits 
takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits
push play on the instrumental thats recorded
step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
some sort of track appeared like a plaque
and some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
takin' a bow cause I got style
never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short 
guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
so get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around
cause I'mma break it down

[Eazy-E]
Last time I was takin' my time with this
but other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
but they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
ready to go, like never before
givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
and I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
and I think I'm gonna rock then
you got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
to freeze after I'll cut ya cause I'mma butcher
and say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
M.C. Ren: "But ya the dopest one I ever saw!" 
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
and when I'm on the mic I always throw down
to keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
so listen cause I'mma break it down

[Eazy-E]
Now look at me and not the poster
and you could see right off I got the most of
the talent, experience or a trade 
and complements for the rhyme thats made
talks over today if this one so
pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
cause I don't need water to clear my throat
comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
wantin' to get wit me this routine 
keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
can ya dis this man I don't think so
once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
comin' out with songs like hit after hit
cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
makin' it sound so dope cause I'm a genius
but your amazed with ya happy to see this
brother go crazy on wax
flowin' away like if I was on a sax
doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight
relax and chill while your up tight
pumpin' up the funky sounds
yo you should know it's kinda persist 
that the E is gonna break it down
