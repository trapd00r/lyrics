I donât want a lot for Christmas
Thereâs just one thing I need
I donât care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas 
Is you

I donât want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I donât care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I donât need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus wonât make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

I wonât ask for much this Christmas
I wonât even wish for snow
Iâm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I wonât make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I wonât even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of childrenâs
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleighbells ringing
Santa wonât you bring me the one I really need
Wonât you please bring my baby to me

I donât want a lot for Christmas
This is all Iâm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want You for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is 
You baby
