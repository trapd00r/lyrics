A while ago you looked at me
And said there'd come a time
You'd have to go away
You put it on the line
And told me we should only
Take each moment day by day

Well I know that there's a time in life
When people change
And go their separate ways
But I miss you, more each day

You're a million miles away
But I feel you in my heart
Though it hurt to leave that way
We'll we knew that from the start
Cos you never did pretend
Our love would never end

There is no way to love
No rules that we can follow
Nothing simple or defined
We make our own
And some we borrow
Hoping it won't end
But darling now we know
We've got no-where left to go

You're a million miles away
But I feel you in my heart
Through it hurt to leave that way
Well we knew that from the start
Cos you never did pretend
Our love would never end
Our love would never end

And if I travelled to the stars
Would I find out where you are
Touch the secret in your heart
And set it free
Or would you turn away
Cos I miss you more each day

You're a million miles away
But I feel you in my heart
Through it hurt to leave that way
Well we knew that from the start
Cos you never did pretend
Our love would never end
Our love would never end
