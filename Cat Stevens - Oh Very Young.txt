Oh very young, what will you leave us this time
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now
They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans
Denim blue, fading up to the sky
And though you want them to last forever, you know they never will
And the patches make the goodbye harder still

Oh very young, what will you leave us this time
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven
And though you want to last forever, you know you never will
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still

Oh very young, what will you leave us this time
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
Oh very young, what will you leave us this time
