Tonight, is the night (Yeah)

Mon cheri, baby (Yeah)
Let us light a candlelight
Voulez-vous couche
'Cause it's cozy here tonight (Oh yeah)

Aha, you're wearing Calvin Klein
And I am not a fool (Not a fool)
There must be something in the wine
'Cause I think I love you

Kiss me here, and kiss me there (Oh yeah)
I wanna be your little teddybear
Kiss me here, and touch me there (and there)
Come on and show me that you really care

Mon cheri, baby
I am burning for your touch
Je ne sais pas pourquoi (Ahh)
But I really missed you much (Yeah)

My God, you're wearing Calvin Klein
Is this a deja-vu? (Deja-vu)
There must be something in the wine
'Cause I feel for you (Oh yeah)

Kiss me here, and kiss me there
I wanna be your little teddybear
Kiss me here, and touch me there (and there)
Come on and show me that you really care

(Oh yeah, ooo, uhh, give it to me, yeah, uh-huh, kiss me)

Baby, I'll never let you down
'Cause the first time I saw you,
I was like Wow!
So don't talk, just kiss

Kiss me here, and kiss me there (Aw yeah)
I wanna be your little teddybear
Kiss me here, and touch me there (and there)
Come on you sexy little teddy bear (Just kiss)

Kiss me here (and there)
And kiss me there (and there)
I wanna be (and there)
your little teddybear (Aww, aww yeah)

Kiss me here, and touch me there
Come on you sexy little teddy bear

Just kiss
(Aww, magic)
(Kiss me)
