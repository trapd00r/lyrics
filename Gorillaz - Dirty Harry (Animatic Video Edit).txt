I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
No, they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chance
I need a gun 'cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

In my backpack, I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your is so weaken with anger and discontent
Some are seekin' in search of like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy ready for retaliation
I change the whole occasion to a pine box six-under
Impulsive, don't ask wild wonder
Orders given to me is 'Strike' and I'm thunder
With lightning fast reflexes on constant alert
From the constant hurt that seems limitless
With no drop in pressure
Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'Til they see you break
They can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you Philip your Sousa
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days visit and I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
The war is over, so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when we used to dance?
Man, all I wanna do is dance

Dance, dance, dance
I need a gun to keep myself among
