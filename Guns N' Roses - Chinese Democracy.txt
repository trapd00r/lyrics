It don't really matter
You're gonna find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter
You're gonna leave this thing to somebody else

If they were missionaries
Real time visionaries
Sittin' in a chinese stew
To view my disinfatuation

I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong*
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now

'Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
But all I got is precious time

It don't really matter
Guess I'll keep it to myself
Said it don't really matter
Each time I'll cry for somebody else

'Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
But all we got is precious time
More than you got to fool a nation
But all I got is precious time

It don't really matter
I'll guess you'll find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter
So you can hear it now from somebody else

You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat 'em enough they'll die
It's like a walk in the park to the cells
And now you're keeping your own kind in hell
And when your great wall rots, blame yourself
While they all reach out for your help
And you're out of time
