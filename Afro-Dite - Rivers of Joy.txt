Send "Rivers Of Joy" Ringtone to your Cell ´ve been around and I´m just wishing on a star
I´ve travelled a long way, but I never been this far
I´ve seen the world with my eyes, never did I know
But I´m gonna find a way, no matter what they say

In the rivers of joy, halleluja, joy - I believe
In the rivers of joy, halleluja, joy - I will find
In the rivers of joy, halleluja, joy - all the happiness
In the rivers of joy, halleluja, joy - of the world

I´ve been around and I´m just wishing on a star
I´ve travelled a long way, but I never been this far
I´ve seen the world with my eyes, never did I know
But I´m gonna find a way, no matter what they say

There are times when I just wanna lay down on the ground
And never rise again no matter what´s been found
But than I realise, I have to carry on
I try to move along to the rivers of joy

In the rivers...

So many people pass me by without a sign
I try to catch them but I don´t know if it´s right
As far as I can see, I still got much to learn
I have to find a way, no matter what they say

It´s time to wake up now, ´cause much is still undone
I made my mind up and nothing gets me down
And I won´t stop this time until I´m really through
I have to move along to the rivers of joy

In the rivers...

And now when I know myself
I see it all so clear, there´s nothing more to fear

You can find joy and happiness
No matter what storm you come across
So hear me when I say, you´re here to stay
Hold on tight and I´ll be right

You can find joy and happiness
No matter what storm, just happiness
You just take a look deep down, to the rivers of joy

In the rivers...
