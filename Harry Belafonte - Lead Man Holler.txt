Send "Lead Man Holler" Ringtone to your Cell You hear me calling at the crack of dawn
Jump up brothers come and face the morn
Forget your aching from the day before
'Cause today we’re goin’ to do that and more

Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar

I want de men, the women and the children too
We got a long day out we got a lot to do
We got to cut up, stack up and load the cane
You better bring a shawl 'cause it look like rain

Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar

Well a working man I am tired and true
I won’t ask you nothin’ that I wouldn’t do
Well you pay today is the same as last
Your work’s the same, just a little fast

Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar

Well I’d like to tell you ‘bout yesterday
You work quite well, I am proud to say
I want ev’ry man to try his will
And make yesterday look like he was standing still

Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar
