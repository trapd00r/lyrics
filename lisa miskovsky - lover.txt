Send "Back to Stoneberry Road" Ringtone to your Cell True love was travelling on a gravel road
I followed into darkness, defied the bitter cold
As the lights of my hometown faded into night
I lost all my hope then, to ever make it right

And I can´t tell you what I saw
No, you´ve got to make it on your own
And I won´t tell you what I know
No, you have to make it on your own

True love still travels along these dusty roads
For true love and friendship, I´ll carry any load
I miss the lights of my hometown,
´cause I stayed away too long
For true love I travelled
For love I wrote this song

And I can´t tell you what I saw
No, you´ve got to make it on your own
And I won´t tell you what I know
No, you have to make it on your own
