Sittin' alone and I hear rain fallin' on my windowsill 
Just wanna do what's right but I don't know if I ever will 
There's so many reasons, too many excuses 
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses 
And I'm so lonely 
It's kind of scary 
And this kind of lonely is making me weary 
I'm so lonesome I could die 

Sittin' alone and I am waitin' for the sun to shine 
Sometimes I kneel and pray hoping someday you'll be mine 
She's so many miles away 
So many things to say 
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway 
Cause I'm so lonely 
The sex is empty 
But this kind of lonely makes it easy to tempt me 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
I'm so lonesome I could die 

Sittin' alone and I am waitin' for somebody to call 
Think if I up and died wouldn't nobody notice at all 
Cause I'm so insecure and I feel so unsure 
Can't take it anymore, no 
It's never been like this before 
And I'm so lonely, feel like cryin' 
And this kinda lonely is worse than dyin' 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
I'm so lonesome I could die 
I'm so lonesome I could die
