Yeah, ladies and gentleman
Broadcasting live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bounce it
Come on

The first day of the rest of my life (X)
Stand behind the mic like Walter Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keeping my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory, you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck, not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut (c'mon)
Hennesy and Orange Juice, baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down, and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while I post the range
Going up and down my dick like the stock exchange

(Chorus 2x)
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that (X) stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefa (uh-huh), Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop tops sittin' on twenties using rappers like crash test dummies
Stackin' real estate and money - It's funny 
How things change overnight when you thinking right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

(Chorus 2x)
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

What an event? We hardcore 100%
Making it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents (X)
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demandin' respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
It seems like everybody around me did change, but me
I stand alone on my own two feet 
Stab a track, strangle the beat - restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like bitumen grit
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Crawl back, bounce in the spot, slide right in
I ain't trying to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Representin' nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennesy, rock plenty of ice, make it a double and SCREAM

(Chorus 2x)
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

(Snoop Dogg)
So there you have it
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
X to the motherfuckin' Z
Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant
Xtrodinary, Xciting,  X-alotta
X 'em with a little bit of Xtasy
X-ing your bitch ass out if you tryna test a g
And what's the recipe?
Xcalibur weaponary
And we shoot Xceptionally
That there is hot
X marks the spot?
Fuck naw, X spots the marks
Xclamation point, niggaz.....
