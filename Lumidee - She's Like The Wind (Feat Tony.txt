Listen baby I've been around
I know that you like how I wear my crown
And I know that im something that is so profound
So far what im hearing look I like the sound
Everybodys talkin about it
We could be talkin why would u doubt it
Your plams are sweaty and your heart sounds poundin
This is what u feeling tell me about it

(Tony Sunshine)
Shes like the wind
Thru my tree
(baby yea baby yea)
Shes rides all night
Next to me
Like u won't believe( No)
She leaves me the moonlight
Only to burn me wit the sun
Damn it I believe she knows
She takin my heart
She doesn't know what shes done
Baby please

I feel her breath in my face ( baby I can feel)
Her bodys close to me ( her body close to me)
Can't look in her eyes ( can't look in your eyes)
Shes outta my league (shes outta my league oh)
Just a fool to believe
Shes got everything I need
Shes like the wind

( Lumidee )
If u cant conceive it muffin
Cause u just let it be its nothing
Look we just hangin around
Sneakin a look
When I can just put you down

( Tony Sunshine )
Girl I look in the mirror (what u see what u see)
And all I see ( tell me what u see girl, tell u I can feel this baby)
Is a young old man with only a dream ( ooo oh oh)
Am I just fooling myself (yea)
Thinkin she'll stop the pain (yes she will yes she will)
Living without her
I'd go insane
Damn it I believe she knows

Feel her breath on my face ( baby I can feel)
Her body close to me ( her body close, yes I do)
Can't look in her eyes (cant look in her eyes)
She's outta of my league ( shes outta my league oh)
Just a fool to believe
She got everything I need
She's like the wind

( Lumidee)

Pass ur way and its givin me a rush
