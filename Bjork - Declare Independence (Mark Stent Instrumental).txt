Send "Innocence (Mark Stent instrumental)" Ringtone to your Cell I once had no fears
None at all
And then when
I had some

To my surprise
I grew to like both
Scared or brave
Without them

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Untouchable
Innocence roared
Still amazes

When I once was
Innocent
It's still here
But in different places

Neurosis
Only
Attaches
Itself to
Fertile
Ground
Where it can flourish

The thrill of fear
Thought I'd never admit it
The thrill of fear
Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places

Fear is a powerful drug
Overcome it and
You think that you can do
Anything!

Should I
Save myself
For later
Or generously give?

Fear of
Losing
Energy
Is draining

It locks up your chest
Shuts down the heart
Miserly
And stingy
Let's open up : share!

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places
