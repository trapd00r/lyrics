Manic depression is searching my soul
I know what I want, but I really don’t know...
Feeling, sweet feeling
I wish I could remember
Manic depression is searching my soul

I'm a woman, so weary
My sweet cause is in vain
I make love, take love, break love
It’s all the same
(When it’s over)
Feeling, sweet feeling
I wanna caress
Manic depression - you've captured my soul...

I was awakened one night
With a sack thrown over my body
Arguments about where to bury the dead

I felt alone and abandoned
Cast into tumbling waves
And suddenly I am out of the light half naked
Children stare open-mouthed
At my crippled frame
Hunched inside the chaos of my love
And I don't even know who I am

My shoulders in white softness
Wings of a dove crushed beneath stone
Hidden tears, impatient
Wiped away with bruised, cut palms
A creature sold off to the evil ones

And I try to imagine the manner in which to operate
Waiting for love to emerge

Instead, it will stagnate
Sink down into itself
And make me suffer mournful shadows

And still there is no room for me
No room for me

Think I’m goin' send myself off,
And go on down
'Cause there's really ain’t no use in me hanging around

Music, sweet music, I wanna caress!
Manic depression, you're forestraying mess...

(I hope to keep the chanel open
I hope to keep the fires alive...
Hope the stars don't fall down tonite
Hope for happy days             (Instead, I will stagnate)
Hope for love to stay              (Sink down into myself)
Manic depression is heading my way...) (Born to suffer mournful shadows
                                                   And still there is no room for me)
