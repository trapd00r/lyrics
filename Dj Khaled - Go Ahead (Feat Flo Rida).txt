Yeah, I met this shorty last night right, real rap
And you know she looked like she was with her man
And you know I ask, you with your man
She was like, nah that's my friend, oh okay
So that was my cue, ayo, Fab, aye, Khaled

Shorty wanna give me the go ahead
That I'ma stay even when I need to go ahead
And if I feel somethin' I'ma try
Figured you winked at me not just somethin' in your eye

See shawty, you ain't got to tell me what I know
That was E40 who said tell me when to go
I know I got the green light and y'all get the red light
So if the head right I'll be there every night

Every night like a playoff game
You hard workin' haters take a day off, man
We the what? We the best, that's so true
When I walk in this bitch, baby that's your cue

I know you see me starin' girl, I see you lookin' at me
Go find and it's apparent girl you feelin' luck in the street
Girl tell me what's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
What's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead

It's the boss, you know we global
DJ Khaled, Flo-Rida, ya know how it is
Baby you need international phone call to call me
It's global right here

I need bitch who motivated and know multiplication
It's serve collect calls 'cause I got multiple cases
Let it be house yea, the comfortable places
Married to the game on a prenuptial basis

Khaled, he the best in the game when he break it
She the baddest in the club and I'm willin' to take it
We got a lot 'o dollars, gotta be willin' to make it
And if you wanna baby, might just be willin' to taste it

Boss, I'm thuggin' and she lovin' it
Gotta have protect one, sippin' on that bubbly
It's hard not to notice me, we known globally
He's sittin' on the top of the world just so comfortably

I know you see me starin' girl, I see you lookin' at me
Go find and it's apparent girl you feelin' luck in the street
Girl tell me what's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
What's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead

Hey, let me get the okay shawty, what's on your brain?
I wanna know I see you lookin', I been peepin' your game
I get a rhythm, see me jookin' T, teach you a thang
Or two, I'm in the dang zip, you wanna come entertain me boo?

We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a playa unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say cheers, let's take a toast

No wheat or white bread in my Pilsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G O
All eyes on you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties strollin' all over the city

I know you see me starin' girl, I see you lookin' at me
Go find and it's apparent girl you feelin' luck in the street

Crack, how hot is hot?
She on fire baby, burn the block
I even taught her how to turn to pot
You cool it off, and it come back rock crack

Yes, I am him
Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland

White chicks is standin' on line
Black chicks is standin' on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

I know you see me starin' girl, I see you lookin' at me
Go find and it's apparent girl you feelin' luck in the street
Girl tell me what's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
What's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
