There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Ridin' down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
takes him higher
Tryin' to find his heaven above
but he's dyin' to be loved, dyin' to be loved

He's tellin' me livin'
is so magic
Something is forever
so he claims
He's talkin' 'bout lyin'
it's so tragic baby
But don't you worry 'bout today
we got freedom comin' our way, freedom comin' our way

How long
do you
think he is gonna last
carryin' on outta gas

See all the others say
"do what you please"
Gotta get the brothers together
and the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
you gonna marry me?

Bridge:

I'll be stone crazy
love comin' in at you
Stone crazy baby

There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Ridin' down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
takes him higher
Tryin' to find his heaven above
but he's dyin' to be loved, dyin' to be loved
