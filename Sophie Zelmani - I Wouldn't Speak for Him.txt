If it wasn't the ocean

wasn't the breezes

wasn't the white sand

there might be no need


If I could sleep through the cold nights

If I could breathe and hatred

If I had worked til summer

Maybe I wouldn't feel so humble


Oh, you

It's always you

It's always you


If red roses weren't so lovely

wine didn't taste so good

If stars weren't so romantic

then I could do what I should


Oh, you

It's always you

It's always you

Oh, you

It's always you

It's always you


If you love me, I could command it

Get your hand to understand it

I'd go twice around the world

even though I may not find it


Oh, you

It's always you

It's always you

Oh, you

It's always you

It's always you


Oh, you               (wasn't the ocean)

It's always you   (wasn't the breezes)

It's always you   (wasn't the white sand,  there might be no need)

Oh, you               (wasn't the ocean)

It's always you   (wasn't the breezes)

It's always you   (wasn't the white sand,  there might be no need
