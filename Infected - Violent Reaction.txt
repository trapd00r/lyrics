consummated
rest the head
it just holds us back now
still she keeps on looking
of course [2x]
nows theres nothing I hate as much
wet the lips
shut your pretty mouth
use the kiss

words under my breath
taking my time
breaking your smile
feed the wish

taking my time
breaking your smile
everyone goes away
I cant even try
I watched you slip away
