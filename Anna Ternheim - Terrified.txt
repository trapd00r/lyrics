No one I'll rather be with than you
Never say the word, but our eyes always do
My head explodes and my mind's a mess
And I'm dying to move like young boys do

No one I'll rather be with than you
Away with the bothers and the saddest of news
Sober or not, high and down below, days you know
But nothing flows

You see me, like no one, saw me before
You see me, like no one, saw me before

And this part terrifies me so

No one makes me free like you make me
I speak my mind, I'm honest and I'm cruel
I lay out my cards, I'm a joke, I'm a fool
But the beast in my sleeps oh so peacefully
Oh so peacefully

You see me, like no one, saw me before
You see me, like no one, saw me before
You see me, like no one, saw me before
You see me, like no one, saw me before
