Ah ah ah ah 
Okey 

It's so confusing 
You sure been messing with my mind
Eh eh eh eh yeah 
You cut me loose and 
Suddenly we're doing fine 
I'm not a perfect little girl 
But I should get what I deserve 
And I refuse to be your mother 
So tell me 

What's in it for me 
I really gotta know 
What's in it for me 
This ain't no one man show 
To in my life 
You come and you go 
Ain't happy about it 
So I gotta know 
What's in it 
What's in it for me

Please understand me 
Your games ain't working anymore 
Ain't working anymore 
You can't have this candy 
And keep one foot outside the door, nooo  
And how you only come around 
When your life is upside down 
And I'm about to blow your cover 
So tell me 

What's in it for me 
I really gotta know 
What's in it for me 
This ain't no one man show 
To in my life 
You come and you go 
Ain't happy about it 
So I gotta know 
What's in it 
What's in it for me

I need more than a little fun 
Cause I only play for keeps 
I gotta know what's it all about 
Go ahead, spit it out 
Say what's in it for me
