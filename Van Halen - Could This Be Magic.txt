You ready? (Yeah)
One, two, one, two, three, four

Out upon the islands on a cool summer night
Buddy, you don't got to hurry, take your time
What you need is on the menu and you get it tonight
Buddy, you got womens on your mind

Could this be magic? Or could this be love?
Could this turn tragic? You know that magic often does

And I see lonely ships upon the water
Better save the women and children first
Sail away with someone's daughter
Better save the women and children first

I hear music on the landin' an' there's laughter in the air
Just could be your boat is comin' in
Yeah you're leanin' back an' yeah, a-foot tappin'
Ain't got your head right
There's a full moon out tonight
Baby, let's begin

And she said "Could this be magic? Or could this be love?", uh oh
An' I said "Could this turn tragic? You know that magic often does"

And I see lonely ships upon the water
Better save the women and children first
Sail away with someone's daughter
Better save the women and children first

Edward?
Thank you

And she said "Could this be magic? Or, could this be love?"
And I said "Could this turn tragic? You know that magic often does"

An' I see lonely ships upon the water
Better save the women and children first
Sail away with someone's daughter
Better save the women and children first, yes, ah
