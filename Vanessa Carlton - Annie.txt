Watch her as she flew deep within the blue 
The day out from the county ICU 
There's nothing you can do 
Someone gently says to you 
The doctor says that now it won't be long 
I try and live up til the moment and I hope that I don't blow it 
And what is it in me that she hears? 
It's just a song she likes 
Her little arms around my neck 
And a dying girl whispers in my ear 

Tell me now can you feel it? 
I've been keeping company with ghosts 
She comes to me like a piece of summer 
She comes to me on the days when I need it most 

Well summer dies and nothing lasts forever 
And you're so fine, the way you stand up to your fears 
The summer dies and its just moments we have together 
I'd give my bones for you to get a few more years 
For you and I, oh Annie 
More to life than trying to survive, oh Annie 

My boyfriend took pictures of me as I held you 
I travel alone and the loneliness brings me to tears 
The summer dies and it's just moments we have together 
I'd give my bones for you to get a few more years 
For you and I, oh Annie 
More to life than trying to survive, oh Annie 

Stronger than the hands that hold you 
You sing along to the song on the radio 
If I drank too much and I am reckless
Just this once would you forgive this 

And hold on, the days gone by 
Tell me now can you feel it? 
I can't keep this all to myself 
She's elegant and she means it, no 

Years for you and I, oh Annie 
More to life than trying to survive, oh Annie 
Watch her as she flew deep within the blue 
Watch her as she slips away from you 
I'll keep fingers crossed always for you
