What I choose to do
Is of no concern to you and your friends
Where I lay my hat may not be my home
But I will last on my own

'Cause it's me, and my life
It's my life, it's my life

Oh the world to set in the palm of my hand
Not that you'd see
And I'm tired and bored of waiting for you
And all those things you never do

'Cause it's me, and my life
It's my life, it's my life
