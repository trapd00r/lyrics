She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down-to-Earth flavour

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I, I realize
That she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her
And getting on a motorbike
Looking rather ladylike
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared?
Is she really gone for good?

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

[rapped]
We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens
And Manhattan
And The Bronx
And Staten Island
I can't forget New Jersey
And Long Island
And all over the world
We came to rock for everybody, like this

Anybody seen my baby
Has anybody seen her?
Anybody seen her around
If I could just close my eyes
I'll reach out, reach out and touch the prize
Anybody (Anybody seen her)
Anybody seen her around
Oh yeah, anybody, anybody seen her (Anybody seen my baby)
Lost, lost and never found (Anybody seen her around)
I must have called her a thousand times
Sometimes I just think she's just in my imagination
Oh, hey
Uh-huh, huh
