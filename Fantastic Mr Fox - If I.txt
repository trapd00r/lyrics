Let me take a little tick now to put color on the scene
in the valley lived three yokles singin' Boggis, Bunce, and Bean!
Now these three crazy jackies have our hero on the run,
shot the tail off the cuss with a fox-shooting gun,
but that stylish little fox was as clever as a wit and as quick as a gopher that was hyper-ac-a-tive!
Now those three farmers sit, 'twere there's a hole 'twas once a hill, singin' diddle dee daddle do doodle dum!
and as far as I can reckon they are sittin' up there still,
singin' zippy zee zappy zoo yappy yooo...
