[Eminem:]
G-G-G-G-unnii [burp]Shit..

(shady)
We back! Invasion, Part 2
The conspiracy

Cause we ain't gunna never stop, you just keep wastin' you energy on us 
You should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us cause we ain't fuckin' with you 
And it must be fuckin' with you so much you must be goin' out your mind (mind)

[Verse 1:]
They say i'm a damn way from my entire empire crumbilin'
Speak up your mumbillin'
What the fuck are you so (be,be,be,be,k,k,k,k) okay baby this is Shady I know you is a lil baby and wish we would just go away and we may weeble wobble but we don't fall down like J master J's two turn tables(R.I.P.)our label is just too stable
Your magazine is so mutha fuckin' thin you usin' staples to hold it together 
It's turnin' back into a news paper
And y'all got someting for my ass every issue
Thank you cause I keep runin outta fuckin' tissue
And not to diss you but god I was sick of lookin' at you
Atleast I can know when nikes' got a new tennis shoe
But I guess no g'news is always good g'news 
Movin' on to big, better things (Chickachickacheureh)
50's blowin' up 
Missy keeps on throwin' up
What the fuck is goin' on?
Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady wait a minute baby leave the world alone just go up there and be humble and take them another time
Bush has just declared the World a fuckin' war zone
Meanwhile we got a war goin' on of our own at home
My fuckin' minds blown, tryin' to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhine stones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy ain't that right whoooaaaa
Wait a minute i'm ramblin', back to the matter at hand it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presly the selfish MC back to ruin rap and destroy the industry 
Single handedly and oh man did we yeah me an 50, obie me and Twizzy, and Nelly, and Missy, and Jigga god damn it's all a plan devised by the man
It's a conspiracy again fake shit and anybody who can't make hits or dope shit lyrically
So fuck what ya hurd or what you read about
We ain't ruinin' rap baby we just tryna' weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to Roc The Mic right!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
Cause your magazine is over in less than six months 
Hahah, Shady records, still aftermath
And don't think we can hear you muthafuckas talking, cause we can't, we don't hear y'all, so we're just gunna sit back for the rest of our lives while you ride our dicks.
