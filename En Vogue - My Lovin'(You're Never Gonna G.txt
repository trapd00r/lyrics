I remember how it used to be you never were this nice
You can't fool me
Now you talkin'
Like you made a change
The more you talk
The more things sound the same

What makes you think
You can just walk back
Into her life
Without a good fight

I just sit back
And watch you make a fool of yourself
You're just wasting your time

Repeat chorus eight times:no, you're never gonna get it, never ever gonna get it, my lovin'

Now you promise me
The moon and the stars
Save your breath
You won't get very far

Gave you many chances
To make changes
The only thing you changed
Was love to hate

It doesn't matter what you do
Or what you say
She doesn't love you, no way

Maybe next time
You'll give your woman a little respect
Then you won't be hearing her say that-

Repeat chorus two times

Doesn't matter what you do
Or what you say
She doesn't love you, no way

Maybe next time
You'll give your woman a little respect
Then you won't be hearing her say that-
Chorus
