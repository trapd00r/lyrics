Remembering me
Discover and see
All over the world
She is known as a girl

To those who are free
their mind shall be key
forgotten as the past
'cause History will last

God is a girl, wherever you are.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

God is a girl, however you live.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

She wants to shine, forever in time,
she is so driven, she's always mine.
Clearly and free, she wants it to be,
a part of the future, a girl like me.

There is a sky illuminating us,
someone is out there that we truly trust,
there is a rainbow, for you and me,
a beautiful sunrise, eternally.

God is a girl, wherever you are.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

God is a girl, however you live.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl.
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
