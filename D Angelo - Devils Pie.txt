Why ask why, till we fry

Who am i, to justify
All the evil in our eye
When I myself, feel the high
From all that I despise
Behind the jail or in the grave
I have to lay, in this bed I made
If I die, before I wake
Hope the Lord don't hesitate

Get 2 heaven, went through hell
Tell my peeps, all is well
All them fools, whose soul's 4 sale
Sitting next to the Jezebel
Demons screaming, in my ear
All my anger, all my fear
If I holler, let them hear
In this spinning sphere

Main ingredients 2 this dish
Goes like this, here's the list
Materialistic, greed and lust, jealousy, envious
Bread and dough, cheddar cheese,
flash and stash, cash and cream
Temperatures, at a high degree
Where niggas come 2 feast

Hell's this, all about
Apocalypse, ain't no doubt
Everybody's ho'ing out, all the loot all the clout
Right or wrong
Do or die
Only the vengeance, will pacify
Watch your back
And so will I
In these days and time

Ain't no justice
It's just us
Ashes 2 ashes
Dust 2 dust
Time has come, for most of us
2 choose in which, God we trust
I know I, was born 2 die
Searching 2 find
Piece of mind
With eighty five, dumb and blind
There can be no compromise
