Have you ever yearned to go
Past the world you think you know?
Been enthralled to the call
Of the beauty underneath?

Have you let it draw you in
Past the place where dreams begin?
Felt the full breathless pull
Of the beauty underneath?

When the dark unfolds its wings
Do you sense the strangest things?
Things no one would ever guess
Things mere words cannot express?

Yes

Do you find yourself beguiled
By the dangerous and wild?
Do you feed on the need
For the beauty underneath?

Have you felt your senses served
And surrendered to the urge?
Have been hooked as you looked at the
At the beauty underneath?

When you stare behind the night
Can you glimpse its primal might?
Might you hunger to possess
Hunger that you can't repress?

Yes

So strange yet beautiful
Everything's just as you say

And he's so beautiful
Perhaps too beautiful
What I suspect cannot be
And yet somehow, we both see
The very same way

It's the music in your head
Have you followed where it led
And been graced with a taste
Of the beauty underneath?

Does it fill your every sense
Is it terribly intense?
Tell me you need it too
Need the beauty underneath

When it lifts its voice and sings
Don't you feel amazing things?
Things you know you can't confess
Things you thirst for nonetheless

It all so beautiful
Can it be?
Almost too beautiful
Do you see what I see?

To him it's beautiful
My world is beautiful
How can this be what it seems?
All of my most secret dreams
Somehow set free
