I'm in an empty room
I've waited here since noon
The walls are closing in
The room is getting dim
I'm feeling something wrong
But time is getting on
You've left me here alone
You're holding all I own

I can't walk the line
I can't see the time
I'm falling out of view 
I'm sinking into you
I can't walk the line
I can't see the time
I'm falling out of view 
I'm sinking into you

I'm leaving monday 
It's better than sunday, it's better than sunday, it's better than
I'm feeling younger
It's better than wiser, it's better than wiser, it's better than
I'm leaving monday
It's better than sunday, it's better than sunday, it's better than
I'm feeling younger
It's better than wiser, it's better than wiser, it's better than

It's getting dark outside
I shrink and try to hide
There's no one else to blame
It's always been the same
I'm leaving notes around
So when I'm gone they're found
You'll wish you treated me 
With much more dignity

I can't walk the line
I can't see the time
I'm falling out of view 
I'm sinking into you
I can't walk the line
I can't see the time
I'm falling out of view 
I'm sinking into you

I'm leaving monday 
It's better than sunday, it's better than sunday, it's better than
I'm feeling younger
It's better than wiser, it's better than wiser, it's better than
I'm leaving monday
It's better than sunday, it's better than sunday, it's better than
I'm feeling younger
It's better than wiser, it's better than wiser, it's better than
