I'm just as good as you want me to be
Only so sweet as you chose to see
Reaching the level you're setting out
I'm only heading until you say stop

I'm touching you where you let me to
I have all those things you say I do
Who I am
You tell me

Who I am
You tell me

I only ravage where you give me the place
I'm only seen until you shade my face
I'm just as good as you want me to be
Who I am
You tell me
