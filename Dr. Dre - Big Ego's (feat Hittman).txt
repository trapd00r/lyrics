[Dr. Dre:]
I got mo' class than most of 'em, ran wit the best of 'em
Forgave the less of 'em & blazed at the rest of 'em.
What can I say?  Cali-for-ni-A
Where niggas die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a baretta, nigga, I'm down for whatever
I roll wit my shit off safety, for niggas that been hatin' me lately
& the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'Cause from Eazy E, to D.O.C. to D.P.G.
Started from that S.O.B. D.R.E.
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin' pistol holdin'
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure & a builder, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, flow seats watchin' The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases.

 Dedicated to all of those with Big Ego's
 Never fakin' we get the dough & live legal
 Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' & yank the heezos
    Niggas play this in they Rovers Jeeps & Regals.

[Hitman:]
I bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoothy Doobie
Crash & flex on Tuesday's, harassin' hoes at movies
Passin' by with uzis & who you aimin' at?
That shady bitch & that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat... {*automatic gunfire & screaming*}
{*more screaming as tires peel out*}
I don't sympathize for whack hoes & wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride & South Centralized
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryin' to focus on mines, poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s 'loc'est, hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get
Hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' hards, Hitman & Dre
You playin' games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey & cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit crews
That's sick, Aftermath 'cause we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me wit no other by the flow muthafucker.

 Dedicated to all of those with Big Ego's

[Phone ringing 3 & a half times:]

[Picks up phone:]

[Music changes:]

[Singing:]
You look like AC Green.
Bitch don't call here anymore.
Within' like biva reens.
Bitch don't call here anymore.
No no no no.

[Music stops:]

[Hittman on answering machine:]
What up? It's Hittman. I ain't at the crib right now.
So you can leave a name & number after the beep.
Unless it's Tammy's ugly ass, I ain't fuckin' wit you.
