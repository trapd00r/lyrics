What a beautiful morning
The best in life is free

Mmm, what a beautiful morning
Believe me

What a mystery, all the worlds on fire
Yesterdays hard work still in my head
I feel no despair, no regrets or sorrow
Cause this new day makes me dance on air
(What a golden day)

What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
I'd give it all away
And I wonder what more is to come
Let this beautiful morning change my mind
Believe me when I say
The shadows are fading out, oh yeah

As the day grows bright, we are turning pages
And we write new chapters of our lives
Some are strong and long, others weak with sorrow
Keep the focus on the rising sun
(What a golden day)

What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
I'd give it all away
And I wonder what more is to come
And this beautiful morning changed my mind
Believe me when I say
The shadows faded out, oh yeah

Believe me
Crows will always fly
Believe me
They are only birds
You have to, you have to let go
And you will see things in a different light

What a beautiful morning. mmm..
What a beautiful morning
Oooh. Believe me
Oh what a beautiful, what a beautiful morning.

What a beautiful morning...
