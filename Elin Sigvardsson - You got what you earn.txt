Ive come to lift you up somehow,
Youve spent too many years in this damn town.
Years to come and years to go,
Youll get none, though its your show.
Youve put too many steps on the same ground
Youve had your time.
Youve had your turn.
Youve had your share.
I dont mean to be unfair, but youve got to learn.
You only get what you earn
Never heard what your head said.
Painted blue, though your thoughts were red.
Youre still way too tired for your own bed.
Whats wrong with your appetite,
Are you feeling way too full to even have a bite?
How can you see yourself clear, youre out of sight.
Youve had your time.
Youve had your turn.
Youve had your share.
I dont mean to be unfair, but youve got to learn.
You only get what you earn
Why didnt you care, why were you just lying there?
Why did you let it burst when it could bear?
Why didnt you come, shouldnt you be on the run?
Now your star is crashed and burnt and gone.
Youve had your time.
Youve had your turn.
Youve had your share.
I dont mean to be unfair, but youve got to learn.
You only get what you earn...
