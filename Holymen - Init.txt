And I would go
And I would go everyday almost to the sandbox
And 'cause I loved the sandbox so much
And 'cause I had my pail and my shovel
And and my shovel
And I would play in the sandbox
And it would be so fun
And I would make mountains in the sand
And I would have so much fun

And and but one day I went to the sandbox
And it was so sad
And I cried and I cried because
Someone took a doody in my sandbox
He could have played guitar better than Hendrix. And that was so bad
And that was so disgusting
And how could they do that
And and that was so bad

And and and I didn't see it
And and I sat right down in it
And it felt squishy and I got up
And I cried and I cried and I cried

And why didn't they clean up after themselves
Why didn't they clean up the mess

And now my pants are dirty
And I'm crying and I'm crying and I'm crying
And I'm never going to the sandbox again
I'm never going to the sandbox again
And I hate everybody.
