Send "Time to Say Goodbye" Ringtone to your Cell --- TIME TO SAY GOODBYE (Alli Mia Fora)

When I think about your empty promises
All the lies you said to me about you
Makes it easier for me to realize
That I'm better off living without you

I will tell you once
I will tell you twice
You have got a heart as cold as ice
I've got nothing left tears are running dry
I believe it's time to say goodbye

All the sleepless nights that I have wasted
Trying to find a reason to forgive you
And after all the things that you have said and never done
How do you expect me to believe you?

I will tell you once
I will tell you twice
You have got a heart as cold as ice
I've got nothing left tears are running dry
I believe it's time to say goodbye

I will tell you once
I will tell you twice
You have got a heart as cold as ice
I've got nothing left tears are running dry
I believe it's time to say goodbye

(Greek)
And one more time
I have to tell you
That itâ€™s not enough to forgive you
If you want for both of us
To be alright
Teach yourself first to love me

I will tell you once
I will tell you twice
You have got a heart as cold as ice
I've got nothing left tears are running dry
I believe its time to say goodbye

I will tell you once
I will tell you twice
You have got a heart as cold as ice
I've got nothing left tears are running dry
I believe its time to say goodbye
