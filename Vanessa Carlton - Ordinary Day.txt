Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
He was looking to the sky and
As he asked, if I would come along
I started to realize 
That everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' for
Like a shooting star, he shines
And he said

Take my hand  
Live while you can 
Don't you see your dreams lie right 
In the palm of your hand 

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel, no
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words could heal, and
As I looked up into those eyes 
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said

Take my hand 
Live while you can,
Don't you see your dreams lie right 
In the palm of your hand 
In the palm of your hand

Please come with me
See what I've seen
Touch the stars, for time will not flee
Time will not flee, can you see

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Was it all in my head
Did he asked, if I would come along
It all seemed so real 
But as I looked to the door 
I saw that boy, standing there with a deal, and he said

Take my hand 
Live while you can
Don't you Feel your dreams lie right 
In the palm of your hand 
In the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand

Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just tryin' to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
He was lookin' to the sky
