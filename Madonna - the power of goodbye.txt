Your heart is not open so I must go 
The spell has be brokenâ¦I loved you so 
Freedom comes when you learn to let go 
Creation comes when you learn to say no 
You were my lesson I had to learn 
I was your fortress you had to burn 
Pain is a warning that somethingâs wrong 
I pray to God that it wonât be long 
Thereâs nothing left to try 
Thereâs no place left to hide 
Thereâs no greater power  
Than the power of goodbye 
Your heart is not open so I must go 
The spell has be brokenâ¦I loved you so 
You were my lesson I had to learn 
I was your fortress 
Thereâs nothing left to try 
Thereâs no place left to hide 
Thereâs no greater power  
Than the power of goodbye 
Thereâs nothing left to lose 
Thereâs no more heart to bruise 
Thereâs no greater power  
Than the power of goodbye 
Learn to say goodbye 
I yearn to say goodbye.
