[Intro- Eminem & 50 Cent]
Gee wilikers Gatman they got me surrounded
I'm on my way

[Chorus- 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
They say Batman

[Verse 1- 50 Cent]
Robin, Cagney or Lacey, it's 50 cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my people
I'll be act crazy, put a hole thru ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave ya witnesses when I ride B
You fuck with me, you see
I'll be actin' like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art
niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Will daint ya, anger will change ya
And make ya aim that and squeeze

[Chorus 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a batman

Mothafucka you retarded,
you touch 50, I'll leave you dearly departed
We're walkin away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said, were walkin away, did u hear me? You oughta
Be thankful that we aint beefin. Were still breathin and just leave it at THAT
That's when me and 50 and g-unit hop back in the BAT
Mobile it aint gonna be no more rap its gonna be RRRAT
Retaliation will be like them Muslim Shiite ATTACKS
Some where along the line its like me and 50 made PACT
He's got my back, I got his back, BACK
Its almost like were kinda, like Siamese twins
Cuz when we beef, we pull each other in,
To the bull shit like were conjoined at the hip,
Its just unavoidable, some shit is squashable
Some shitll never BOILER OVER
Some of it will just simmer at best, if left alone
but let it be known there will be no sit downs
With no Daves and 'Zinos
There will be no peace discussions with me
There aint gone be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin with me and ill gladly quit fuckin with you
Just spit ya 16 and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin me or the machine or Jimmy Iovine
Or Dre or 50 or D-Twizzy, Obie and just let it be
Or we'll be back with a:.

[Chorus- 50 Cent & Eminem]
Gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a batman
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

[Verse 3- 50 Cent]
nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got 'em on the screen, I'm plottin' in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetary visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, cuz I live it
Showcases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
They say no, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect ai,m you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man its so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

[Chorus- 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you down
Leave the party
