Spoken:
Yeah.
Definitely, definitely, definitely dope.
Definitely, definitely K-Mart.
Yeah, yeah.


Eminem & Dr. Dre :

You find me offensive, I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw out a line any fences, if so to what extents if
Any should I go, 'cause it's gettin' expensive
Bein' on the other side of the court room, on the defensive

They say I cause extensive, psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this, far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too god damn sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous

Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit, for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I

Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers, on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader, and Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him off in between him and Lex Luther

I killed Superman I killed Super-man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic

'Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name
My name was not to become, what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man

Now in the bible it says, thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in, then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after, performing the act of that which

Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say
And what not to say, let's ask Dr. Dre

Dr. Dre (What up?), I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay, to play putt putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But but, I ain't done yet

In football a quarterback yells out hut hut, while he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but just what if, it was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped, and his penis went in, his teeny-tiny little round hiney
And he didn't mean it but his little weenie flinched, just a little bit

And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay, I just need to clear things up
Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name
My name was not to become, what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses

My spider sense is, tellin' me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next, and open up a whoop ass canister
Goddammit Dre where's the god damn beat (Yeah), anyway

Anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it

I got it, high-fived Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head, and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom I

Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

'Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is, I forgot my name
My name was not to become, what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil, my new name is, Rain Man
'Cause I-ahh ahh-ahh-ahh

Spoken:
Yo, Rain Man.
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker, two thousand and...
Two thousand, four hundred and eighty seven million, nine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three...
And seventy. (Yeah)
