Send "Don't Shut Me Out" Ringtone to your Cell I've been thinkin' 'bout somethin' you said
It seems to make no sense to me
That you don't want nobody's love
You say you'll only hurt again
Won't you let me in?

You don't know what you've been missin'
All of my love and all of my guessin'
I'll love you like this, I'll love you like that
I bet you can't take that

DON'T SHUT ME OUT (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you know what love's about
'Cause baby you know nothin'
DON'T SHUT ME OUT (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you live your life without
'Cause baby I've got somethin'

I've been watchin' your body for years
It seems to me you need my help
And you've been drownin' that body in tears
It's time for you to make that change
Baby rearrange

You don't know what you've been missin'
All of my love and all of my guessin'
I'll love you like this, I'll love you like that
I bet you can't take that

DON'T SHUT ME OUT (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you know what love's about
'Cause baby you know nothin'
DON'T SHUT ME OUT (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you live your life without
'Cause baby I've got somethin'
DON'T SHUT ME OUT

Ooh yeah'Ooh baby'Tell me'Tell me'
Why in the world do I have to take this?
Why in the hell do you have to make this?
Hard for you, hard for me
Girl I love you can't you see that all my lovin'
I try to give to you, tell me do you want it?
Or would you rather have me say that I love you

You...you...you...yeah...
I'll love you like this, I'll love you like that
I bet you can't take that

DON'T SHUT ME OUT (D-D-Don't)
Don't tell me that you know what love's about
'Cause baby you know nothin'
