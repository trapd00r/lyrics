Put your money in the slot
Wait for it to drop
See the credits role
And we are ready to go...

Trading places with chimpanzees,
Get yourself snug and get strapped in,
Introducing you to higher G-forces,
Feeling weightless and my balance adrift.
Countdown that's in process,
Checking out the power systems,
Launch a rocket through the outer limits,
You're the only one who really appreciates it.

Power lights are flashing,
Above my head, man it's dashing,
It's a beautiful view, both the earth and the moon,
Switch to automatic, picking up static,
Pumping the brakes, honey,
I'm gonna be home late.

Space invaders,
Space gladiators,
Bandits in the sky.
But this is only the start, guy,
We've just invented bullet proof glass, why?
It looks surreal, the atmosphere's dry,
I gave the oath, no one gets out alive.

There's no fighting in space,
No third world to face,
Get a grip, we've got a black out.
Sorry, we've got an eclipse.

Space invaders,
Space gladiators,
Bandits in the sky.
But this is only the start, why?
I'm taking up my bullet proof glass guy.
I'm going back to base,
Rebuilding the brake, prepare for re-orbit,
Impose Marshall Law, start the curfew at 8.

The haunted house is plagued with ghouls,
Freaks coming out of the floorboards,
Power thrusts to the mutant guts,
Zombies that need a mouthwash.
Fought the enemy back,
We've got a lazer attack,
Vampires out in the day time.
I tell you, they risk being eaten alive.

Space invaders,
Space gladiators,
Bandits in the sky.
But this is only the start, why?
I'm taking up my bullet proof glass guy.

You really do deserve that rise,
But then again you're just a fly by night type.
