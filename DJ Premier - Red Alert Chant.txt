aution, red alert, time to do work

ammy with the wet lips sippin on some crist'

nd em

ver there, honey drinking double dares

moking blunts everywhere sayin peace to Premier

eah, ass shakin, get this thing poppin

ss for the takin, got that shit rockin

itches one side, niggas on the next

e thinkin about cake, they talkin about sex

'm talkin toastas and roastas, ain't always tryin to pose

'm gettin closer and closer that gun push your nose up

'all feel, me feel me, even if you can't see me

rom the streets to the beat, let it go, yo watch me freak

kay, here's the final round, this is how it goes down

 got six loaded clips, sick corroded clips

ouble dare everywhere, Hennesee and the Cris'

e gettin drunk and smoked out whole room gettin choked out

ydro and a flow, this bitch wanna talk but nope

tay strong, nothing love of my team

he part I play is wrong, but we got to get the dream

y any means we stay doin our thing

otherfuckers so dumb they can't figure where it's coming from

hey got schools wrong, all they do is pull triggers

ll they do: dig out bitches, some even diggin niggas

hat the fuck? The rap game changin everyday

ard rocks walk away, now this shit is turning gay

ll I say, you come hear it with me, you get your shi
