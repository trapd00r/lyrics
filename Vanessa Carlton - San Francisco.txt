I, I know what you did 
Like a boy of summer gives his first kiss 
Love is dancing on my finger 
He got to the heart of the matter and lingered 
And now I'm walking with the living 
I always liked steinbeck and those old men whistling 

We're back, we're back in San Francisco 
We're back and you tell me I am home 

Talkin' in the mission 
Over coffee, this is my utopia 
Then, I'll be your lady 
As the ocean rises, the sun is fading 

We're back, we're back in San Francisco 
We're back, we're back in San Francisco 
We're back, we're back in San Fran-- 

And now, I feel the ever after 
Over red wine on the eve of summer 
The buzz, the buzz of the city 
As we settle in it's majesty 
I, I know what you did 
Like a boy of summer gives his first kiss 

We're back, we're back in San Francisco 
We're back and you tell me I am home 

You tell me I am home 
You tell me I am home 
You tell me I am home 
Back in San Francisco 

And I know what you did in San Francisco 
I know what you did in San Francisco 
San Francisco
