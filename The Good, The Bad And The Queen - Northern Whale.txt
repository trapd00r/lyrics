Another wave crash over you
It put you in a spell
On a cold place you know well

It pulls you further out to sea
Under the lights at Tilbury
Life still love
Your melody

In a tide end town
Everyone hallucinating on you
But a northern whale
Wouldn't leave you until
All England's tears are done
And the day comes we move on
Endlessly

They only see you in a dream
Lying by a dark machine
Sing on love
Your melody

In a tide end town
Everyone hallucinating with you
But a northern whale
Wouldn't leave until
All our tears are done
And the day comes we move on
Endlessly
