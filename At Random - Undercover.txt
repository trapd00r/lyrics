Send "A Higher Power" Ringtone to your Cell It's magic It's magic the way we got together,
There's magic around us in the air
It's magic It's magic, no not at random
And there must be a higher power somewhere.

I know that magic is an easy word to condemn,
But I've tried other girls and I wasn't made for them,
And I knew it from afar in that lonely rock and roll bar
That there must be a higher power somewhere. Go.

It's magic It's magic the way we got together
It's magic as if it was ordained
It's magic It's magic, no not by chance,
And there must be a higher power I'm saying.

I know that magic is an easy word to abuse
But I've tried other words but what words can I use
And I knew it from that first kiss so stingy and so spare
That there must be a higher power somewhere.

It's magic It's magic the way we got together
It's magic It's justice, it's grace
It's magic It's magic, no not at random
And there must be a higher power some place.

They say that magic and the science world collide
But Einstein saw me looking at her and he joined my side
And I knew how it would be the way she hated me
And there must be a higher power somewhere

It's magic It's magic the way we got together
It's magic It's freedom, it's fair
It's magic It's magic no not at random
And there must be a higher power somewhere.
