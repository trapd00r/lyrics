He was a very special warm and gentle person
Who put in music in the world and spoken in rhyme
And it hurts me that I never really knew him
¡®Cause all it would have taken was some time

You know he always seemed to be there when I stumbled
And when mountains got to steep for me to climb
And it tears me up to think I never touched him
¡®Cause all it would have taken was some time

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone I should know

Now he's in another place and I can't reach him
And I feel as though I'm guilty of a crime
I took all he had to give and gave him nothin'
And all it would have taken was some time

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone I should know

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone I should know

Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone I should know

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
