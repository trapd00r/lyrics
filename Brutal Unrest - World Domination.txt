Send "Hidden Dictator" Ringtone to your Cell No shape, no form, no brain, no mind
But the power to control all resistance
Its awesome might cannot be denied
By the world that ignores its existence

Older than time, stranger than life
Don't look for a sign, without warning it will arrive

It can read your mind
See the world inside
Oversees your life
Decides the day you die
Silent life taker
Sentient creator
World recoil in fear
Of the hidden dictator

Presence beyond our imagination
Horrible being of fate
Not one sign of its domination
God prays it never awakes

Older than time, stranger than life
Don't look for a sign, without warning it will arrive

It can read your mind
See the void inside
Oversees your life
Decides the day you die
Silent life taker
Sentient creator
World recoil in fear
Of the hidden dictator

Worlds have risen, lived and died under its obscene command
Kept the balance of galaxies in it's omnipotent hands

Minds of greedy distortion
All are destroyed in its awake
It judges the worth of the low forms of life
Who cower and quiver and quake

Some may call it the savior
Fall to their bellies and pray
Some will try to resist in the hope they'll exist
To experience just one more day

And the lost shall pray for forgiveness
And the fearful and weak start to scream
As the terrible nightmare of a dying world
Becomes beauty beyond any dream

One world must end
New ones begin
A pure life form
From death is born
Silent life maker
Sentient creator
The new world is blessed by the hidden dictator
