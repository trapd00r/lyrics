The saddest thing I ever learned is relationships don't last
Or maybe I just feel that way cause of my past 
Bad memories get to me when I drink mad Hennessey 
Feeling cold and alone even when I got mad friends with me 
I'll still see something that reminds me of her 
I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur 
She found somebody quick. 
I won't find another for a while 
She was about to be my wife and mother of my child 
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged 
And the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange 
Like everything's changed and suddenly you don't trust her just the same 
Then you find out some other man's been fuckin out her brains 
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain 
So much that you can feel it in your veins 
And you can't forget her name 
That's when you Literally go insane 
And you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and 
Then a song plays that says 

Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today" 
Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today" 
Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today" 
Crackled on the speakers 
Trickle down the sleepy subway train 

I don't understand this
This doesn't make any sense
It's like how can you 
Say you love somebody
Yo

I'll never understand how a girl can say she loves a man 
And turn around and have sex with another man 
I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand 
Than to get interrupted and get a call that
She's touching hands
With another man. Oh God!
Another man! I can't even cry. 
My tears been dry.
That's why it's thundering hard out tonight 
And it's dark and it's cold 
Cause the angels can hear me cry, and it's all in my soul 
And all of them know I've never felt this pain in my past 
And it's ironic the first place we made love's the same as the last 
In the shower ... that's why I put the rain with her name 
And my power to trust someone again has faded away 
Other girls want me? 
Tell em it looks like rain today 
I wallow in my sorrow, smoke, and watch tapes that we made 
And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades 
The day I almost gave up everything that I gained 
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
And the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
Like everything's changed and suddenly
It's on tape and you crumble 
Cause you notice on the tape 
She doesn't kiss you, she just fucks you 
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain 
So much that you can feel it in your veins 
And you can't forget her name 
That's when you Literally go insane
And you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and
Then a song plays that says

Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today" 
Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today" 
Wise Men say, "It looks like rain today" 
Crackled on the speakers 
Trickle down the sleepy subway train
