Send "The Second You Sleep" Ringtone to your Cell You close your eyes
and leave me naked by your side
You close the door so I can´t see
the love you keep inside
Love you keep for me

It fills me up
It feals like living in a dream
It fills me up so I can see
the love you keep inside
Love you keep for me

I Stay to Watch you fade away 
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you´ll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you´ll be gone
I wish by God you´ll stay

I stay awake
I stay awake and watch you breath
I stay awake and watch you fly
away into the night
escaping through a dream

I Stay to Watch you fade away 
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you´ll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you´ll be gone
I wish by God you´ll stay

Heeeey

I Stay to Watch you fade away 
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you´ll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you´ll be gone
I wish by God you´ll stay

I Stay to Watch you fade away 
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you´ll be gone
I wish by God you would stay
