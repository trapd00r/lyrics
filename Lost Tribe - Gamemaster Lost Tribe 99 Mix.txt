Embracing the godess energy within yourselves
Will bring all of you to a new understanding and valuing of life;
A vision that inspires you to live and love on planet earth.
Like a priceless jewel, buried in a dark layer of soil and stone,
Earth radiates her brilliant beauty, into the caverns of space and time.
Perhaps you are aware of those who watch over your home,
And experience it as a place to visit and play with reality.
You are becoming aware of yourself,
As a gamemaster.

Imagine earth restored to her real beauty,
Steady trees seems to brush the deep blue sky,
The clouds billow to form the majestic peaks.
The songs of birds fill the air,
Create a symphony on symphony.
The godess is calling for an honouring of what she allows to be created,
Through the form of strength and blood.
Those who own our planet, are learning about love.
