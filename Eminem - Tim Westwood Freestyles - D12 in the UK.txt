[Kuniva]
Yo its Kuniva, I'll cuss hoes out like a drunk sailor
And cock the hammer back like tim the two man tailor
You best be on your best behavior before I slay ya
And watch the video of your life with your lord savior
I can go in off your mom, they get along when they see the gun
And dirty dozen cross my arm and it aint a secret get scared
And be nervous, cuz I'ma be in jail in a cell with C murder
Shady is a general, a soldier form I showed it to him
He saved my life I owe it too him, so compare it to anybody
I serve you on a platter your words dont even matter
You all you leavin badder, I'm a hazard without bowl and loop doop
I shoot thru people at super markets while they ringin up your fruit loops
You challengers get pushed off banisters, I'm unavoidable like anvals
Droppin on toon characters 

[Swifty]
I'm the freak slasher, chop bodies up in meat packer
I reach back for the necks, choppin your feet faster
Than Steven King, I repeatedly beat bastards
The pops for result of havin a meet in maggots
When I see faggots, put three in they fleece jackets
You bleed rapid, poppin all in ya lead actors
Speed n acids when I mourn, didnt even ask for it
Technique's hazardous, you needin Jesus of Nazereth
To see what's happenin, means havin your teeth chatterin
Speak battlin, heat splatter your peeps abdomin
Sweet fashion, I reload and I keep blastin
I breathe action, if you dont believe ask him

[Kon Artis]
I'm sick of bitches man, I done heard enough shit
Talk alot of mouth like they wanna do it
Then they pull down they pants and then I shoot fluid
Then they start runnin screamin like they God called them
And I called them back and then pulled a crackin in
Stick my dick up in and make them rap again
They wanna rap for me and tell me that they love me
Kon Artis your my daddy and I dont wanna be your hubby
I cant be your hub baby I aint gettin married
I'm stand fuckin bitches, it really very scary
My lil cousin named Terry told me that I fucked him too long
And then I gotta get a Jerry curl to make 'em all keep drippin
You *****z know I never really be trippin, my beats bang
Make ears bleed thru walkmens thats why people ignore you like you aint even talkin
You chit chatter and get splattered by a disease beat addict
That spit spontanious like a Prayin Mantis I cut you off
Pickin that gang green your man seen how I get ignorant
By losin my spleen the truth of the seen as soon as my team
Get on we rule cities like zila thru Hong Kong, you wanna knew
You wanna know, you gotta ask my man Proof how the fuck the flow goes

[Proof]
Pull it back pull it back pull it back pull it back
we aint wentin no where, we sippin shampane
Shady records, aint no body better than us
Shady records, no chedder than us
Shady records, aint no body better than us
Shady records, I got your ears goin like its ???(that is hard to tell)
Hotter than a fellon in a carload full of nines
Got the sparkles out to shine, get your back up
And get your dollars out ya spines
Because the head is ill I'm in love with Natasha Betinville
Yo faster than a Porsche, make you disappear
Like advertisement in the Source, so do it baby
I want the sugar baby, my sift from the rabies
Yo Proof D12 is on the haitus, on a scale from 1-10
I'm an 8, wait you dont know how 8 is, 8 is jigga
Thats me, 9 is Slim, 10 is Slim, now I finally give you
The time I give you to Bom Artis has got promise
And me and proof and swift and the Kon Artis
And it aint over boy, who you beef with trust me
I'll tell you Puffy and you can lose big, cuz its that
Face it, I'm a brick face, you get it laced wit a switch blade
Yo I stab you wit a mixtape, tell ya girl ask her how my dick taste
I told you once before that I'm a brick face, I'm a big and I shine plus I spit mace
Make all the bad boys thats missin listen up yo next on this transition
And you know how it is and you know when its gravy next up
Chigga chigga Slim Shady

[Eminem]
I don't figure this rap shit out, I map shit out strategically 
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key 
To my success I've murked from me repeatably (we beat emcees) 
Timing is everything and seem to be the key 
Let them diss your first then respond immediatley 
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war 
Shit not no more we dun scared em off there are no more 
Victims this sick, I'm fixin' to pick some to start shit 
Ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at 
Ain't go no more targets, 
Shit irv and jeff we beat'em to death, benzino in debt 
It seems to just be no one left to bully 
Bush is pussy, why the fuck you think his name is bush? Puss is bushy 
Ain't shit goin on. Shit I been gettin' so bored latley, 
I'm thinking of doing some shit to get you to go hate me, again 
To tell the truth I like the shit better then 
Shit I could spit better, about to kick that sick shit again 
Look, the game just ain't the same, it changin 
Shit Dre's quittin', Jay's quittin', now it just wankstas 
Just sayin' the same shit, its fake and its ancient 
It's making me so bored I'm gonna just make a new language 
Fubba you cova cubba, ubba you ubba ooba 
Youba can subbabick my dadibbabick through a tuba 
sum other luma lama 
I'm not a human, I'ma a suicidal supersonic suicidal uni-bomber 
you think im the new Osama 
Press thinks I'm the new madonna 
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on 
Alot of talk and rumors on us, who's the hottest to be honest 
Hip-hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us
