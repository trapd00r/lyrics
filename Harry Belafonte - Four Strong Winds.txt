Send "Four Strong Winds" Ringtone to your Cell Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone
And Im bound for moving on
I look for you if Im ever back this way
Think i'll go out to Alberta
Weathers good there in the fall
Got some friends I can go to working for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But weve been thru that a hundred times or more
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Aint too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
