Here is why I never called
To say hey I'm alright I will be home any second
I thought you were asleep at home
But you lay wide awake wanted to hear about my night walk

You should have seen me wagging my tail
One tease and I will bite
Throw me a bone and I'll run till I faint
Oh baby you'd cry your heart out

Got home fumbled with my crocked keys
In thru the hallways straight to my doormat
Kicked me out to get some peace
A lovesick little puppy ashamed of its every need

Should have seen him scratching my back
Until my eyes got wider
I say please, please, please put on the old strap
Tame my hunger and desire

I'll be happy to learn any classier trick than
Eating from hands of strangers
I can try I'll behave but nothing will stick
Until I lose some of that taste for danger

And that's why I never called
To say hey I'm alright I will be home any second
I thought you were asleep at home
But you lay wide awake wanted to hear about my night walk

Yeah you wanna talk about my night walk?
