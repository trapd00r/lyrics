Woohoo-hoo
Woohoo-hoo 

Debbie just hit the wall 
She never had it all 
One Prozac a day 
Husband's a CPA 
Her dreams went out the door 
When she turned twenty-four 
Only been with one man 
What happened to her plan? 

She was gonna be an actress 
She was gonna be a star 
She was gonna shake her ass 
On the hood of Whitesnake's car 
Her yellow SUV
Is now the enemy 
Looks at her average life 
And nothing has been alright 

Since Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV 
Her two kids in high school 
They tell her that she's uncool 
'Cause she still preoccupied 
With 19- 19- 1985 

Woohoo-hoo 
(1985) 
Woohoo-hoo 

She's seen all the classics 
She knows every line 
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink 
Even St. Elmo's Fire 
She rocked out to Wham!
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan 
Thought she'd get a hand 
On a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin? 
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen? 
When did reality become TV?
What ever happened to sitcoms, game shows 
On the radio

There was Springsteen, Madonna 
Way before Nirvana 
There was U2 and Blondie 
And music still on MTV 
Her two kids in high school 
They tell her that she's uncool 
'Cause she still preoccupied 
With 19- 19- 1985 

Woohoo-hoo 

She hates time make it stop 
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock? 
And when did Ozzy become an actor? 
Please make this stop 
Stop, stop! 
And bring back...

Springsteen, Madonna 
Way before Nirvana 
There was U2 and Blondie

Since Springstein, Madonna 
Way before Nirvana 
There was U2 and Blondie 
And music still on MTV 
Her two kids in high school 
They tell her that she's uncool 
'Cause she's still preoccupied 
With 19- 19- 1985!
