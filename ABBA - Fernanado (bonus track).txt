Yonde iru, mune no doko ka oku de
Itsumo kokoro odoru yume wo mitai
Kanashimi wa kazoekirenai keredo
Sono mukou de kitto anata ni aeru

Kurikaesu ayamachi no sono tabi hito wa
Tada aoi sora no aosa wo shiru
Hateshinaku michi wa tsuzuite mieru keredo
Kono ryoute wa hikari wo dakeru

Sayonara no toki no shizuka na mune
ZERO ni naru karada ga mimi wo sumaseru
Ikite iru fushigi, shinde iku fushigi
Hana mo kaze mo machi mo minna onaji

Yonde iru, mune no doko ka oku de
Itsumo nando demo yume wo egakou
Kanashimi no kazu wo iitsukusu yori
Onaji kuchibiru de sotto utaou

Tojite iku omoide no sono naka ni itsumo
Wasuretakunai sasayaki wo kiku
Konagona ni kudakareta kagami no ue nimo
Atarashii keshiki ga utsusareru

Hajimari no asa no shizuka na mado
ZERO ni naru karada mitasarete yuke
Umi no kanata niwa mou sagasanai
Kagayaku mono wa itsumo koko ni
Watashi no naka ni mitsukerareta kara


Translation


It's calling, from somewhere within my breast
I want to always dream of dreams that make my heart dance
Though the sadness is countless
I'm sure that beyond it, I can see you

With each mistake they repeat, people
Understand the blueness of the plain blue sky
Though the road may seem to continue without end
These hands of mine can embrace the light

The silent heart when the time comes for parting
The body, which will return to nothing, listens closely
The mystery of living, and the mystery of dying
Is the same for all, even the flowers, the wind, and the streets

It's calling, from somewhere within my breast
Let's draw our dreams, countlessly forever
Rather than saying all there is to say about sadness
Let's use those same lips to sing softly

Listen to the whisper I don't want to forget
Within the closing memories
Even in a mirror shattered to bits
The new scenery will be reflected

The quiet window at the start of morning
Let the body, which will return to nothing, be satisfied
I won't search any longer beyond the sea
Something shining will always be by me
Because I've found it within myself
