Send "So Far to Go (feat. Common & D'Angelo)" Ringtone to your Cell I wanna get closer to you baby

You have come so far
You've got so far to go
You have come so far
You've got so far to go

Let go and let me live inside you
What your mouth don't say baby your thighs do
I want us to arrive to-
gether, I love it when the weather is wet and sticky
Some depict me as being conscious yeah I use my head
It was you that fed my appetite for seduction
Bitin' and cussin', makin' love and uhh
Touchin' where no one has ever touched before
The heat got you open like an oven door
Because of your innocence
Even more you'll remember this, hardcore gentleness
Before you wasn't into this
On the ride your freak became limitless
Holdin' on to the night and we tight as we write on the walls, a story called Go

&lt;Corus&gt;

I love it when you do it, you do it like you believe it
Able to give and receive it
With openness emotions just spill
I'm givin' you something that you can feel
It's hard to stay still
Rubbin' your desires up against mine
I feel you shakin'
I'm thinkin' that it's time
My fingers on the hook of your neck
Deep in your eyes there's a look of respect
Soft and wet brown sugar, mixed with cinnamon
Said you learnin' to trust men again
But this is love, made unselfish
Made for you to feel empowered at the same time helpless
You dealt with a lot in your screams and moans
Something about your walk that I seen Iâ€™m home
But we don't have to think no more,

It's simpliness is kind of raw?? and this is what I came here for uh

You have come so far
You have so far to go
