yo mom, it's mother's day and this song goes out to you
sorry about all the cursing but you know how we gangsta's do

I used to play Capcom VS SNK every single day
then I started writing rhymes, to my dismay
I didn't do as good
as good as I should
if I played MK1
I could not break the wood

I used to break the diamonds
like I use to break the hymens
my front is on max
is what says the simon's

I used to own with reptile on 2
fuck that other ninja wearing the blue
but scorpion is my boy
with him i'd destroy
the flawless victory record
of every robot droid

do you remember yo! noid?
everytime you saw him you were annoyed?
but you still wanted the pizza
he'd freeze it like freeza
the fashion queen from bayside
was turtle (comma) lisa

dominoes plan deployed
avoid the noid!
was stuck in your mind
and you enjoyed
every single minute
you'd bear and grin it
my mom got me the game
with the yo-yo and the midget

kung fu is my mom
kung fu is my mom

KUNG 

FU 

IS MY MOM

she
dresses
to do damage like a bomb
kUng fu
uses metric system long
all day it's happening
it's stronger than strong
sent to a camp
built with a song
sent to her e-mail
this songs for my mom 

she celebrates
she builds a cake
she wears make up
she cheats at skates
she wears the shoes
but her skateboard breaks
she's still the funk
but she waits to wait
then she cracks a punk
and fakes a fake 

holy calamity, screamin insanity
the mayans loved a mermaid
that was really a manatee

to many hallucinogens
going up their nose
reality was twisted
like that american idol show

a moment of clarity
is donated to a charity
pocket fighter for PS1
is quite the rarity

but I found it quick
because I am the shit
my vg seeking skills
make my momma sick

me and my mom
go to the gamestop
she finds the violent version
of gta in a drop

all the fanboys 
bow and give her props
you don't mess w/ my mom
or you'll feel my cap pop

i'm not eminem
I don't diss my mom

my mom is the shit
the motherfucking bomb!

is

there something wrong?

KUNG

FU

IS MY MOM

kung fu kicks ass and so do you mom. I love you. happy mother's day.
