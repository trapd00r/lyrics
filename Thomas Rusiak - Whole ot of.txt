All yours that was my game
But everything's changed, nothing's the same
All yours was my middle name
But I want you to know that my pain remains

I was on you like a skirt at first, hade a thirst, a thing for u,
Sang to u, gave to much for you to kling to.
I ment to be all cool and macho,
I liked you alot, though, you hydroed my mind, yo!
Blindfold vision, my click be sayin listen:
"Ru, your mind's sizzling, chill stop flipping!
You know she's a part of a crew, that be playing with you,
And Ru; she's a whole lot smarter than you!"
A damn fly looker, I got hooked like a sucker!
"Sorry fellas, my mind's to weak, I might suffer!"
I stuck to you and high, but not on herb
You hardcore citykitten, I was waised in the burbs
Laced you in pearls, had money, whenever to funny with,
Still I was on that "Pleas honey"-shit!
You won't admit it, I quit it, it's my loss, of course
You're the boss, I get tossed, I'm all yours...

All yours that was my game
But everything's changed, nothing's the same
All yours was my middle name
But I want you to know that my pain remains

I hade days when I went through a faze, basicly hated you
Out of love, I rated you rockbottom-above.
A thug would have said to you "Fuck off"
But how often does that happen to Ru, I'm to soft for you
My crew be pissed, uncool, I got dissed for less back then.
I better listen to Pee and Petter
"Whatever you do, we're still behind you,
Ru be the bomb don't let anybody hound you!"
Sounds cool to me this time when they rhyme to me,
Ironicly I'm finding my self with tthree and honestly
I easaly enjoy monotany, we're finally
Down with eachother here for one more year.
You didn't care about no tears, I prepared for your brake up.
My minds got raped a few more times, what's up,
But still, you had me stuck for real,
What's the deal, what the fuck, I'm all yours and that's ill....

All yours that was my game
But everything's changed, nothing's the same
All yours was my middle name
But I want you to know that my pain remains

Had a career thing, I was alone for a year.
Got stared at and told the world to beware.
To much for you, yeah, my mind was one on rhymes
And finally we gave each other boots behind
But we're cool, right? Or wrong? Whatever you want, you got it.
I could be buddy, I kept my cellphone warm for you,
On for you, I diled you and tried to
Find you to make things better, not to blind you.
Nomatter what they say, that I'm a bastard and all,
I think faster than ya, so give the bastars a call.
Hey, once all your but not now of course,
I'm the boss bitch, you get tossed, I'm all yours

All yours that was my game
But everything's changed, nothing's the same
All yours was my middle name
But I want you to know that my pain remains

All yours that was my game
But everything's changed, nothing's the same
All yours was my middle name
But not any more cause your game is just to lame
