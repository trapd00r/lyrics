Send "Insanity" Ringtone to your Cell Flashback of insanity 
Flashback of reality 
Flashback of insanity 
destroy my life (x4) 

And all the seven seas i'd sail,it keeps insanity away. 
Feel my everlasting pain, avoid insanity today. 

I ran a thousand miles away,it leads insanity astray.. 
Feel my everlasting pain, avoid insanity today... 

avoid the insanity today 
avoid the insanity today 

Serenity belongs to you,it shines in your eyes.. 
the grasses are greener over there, 
I'm not surprised 

Insanity destroys my life,it's a fever in my veins. 
Somehow i'm prisoner of myself,burnin' out again. 

And all the seven seas i'd sail,it keeps insanity away. 
Feel my everlasting pain, avoid insanity today. 

I ran a thousand miles away,it leads insanity astray.. 
Feel my everlasting pain, avoid insanity today...
