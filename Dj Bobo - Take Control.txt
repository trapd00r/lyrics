Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul

You take you shake you break I'm not fake
You cool the way you move no more mistakes
Can't stand still got the move
Feel the bassline feel the groove
The beat the bass the lyrics are fine
Get on the floor you got no time
Party people I will give you a chance
Wave up your hands and feel in trance
Everybody take a chance waving up your hands
Can you feel this trance
Everybody take a chance waving up your hands
Can you feel this trance
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
Can you see now what I'm saying
The beat is loud and I am playing
playing with your life playing with your soul
Here on stage and under my control
So let the rhythm take you on the floor
With a bass and a drum that you never heard before
Open your mind cause I'm talking about dancing
Open your mind this is not romancing


Everybody take a chance waving up your hands
Can you feel this trance
Everybody take a chance waving up your hands
Can you feel this trance
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
You take you shake you break I'm not fake
You cool the way you move no more mistakes
Can't stand still got the move
Feel the bassline feel the groove
The beat the bass the lyrics are fine
Get on the floor you got no time
Party people I will give you a chance
Wave up your hands and feel in trance
Everybody take a chance waving up your hands
Can you feel this trance
Everybody take a chance waving up your hands
Can you feel this trance
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
Take control of your mind
Your body and your soul
