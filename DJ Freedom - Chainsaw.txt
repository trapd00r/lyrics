see what it is is they ignant de’librate 
simp on indifferent like it were Gibraltar the rock of all wisdom 
mock em, I pimp em 
its all the sun lets me hit em 
with’ll the uncivil the dumbed and everything this side a numb please step your deafs back while I axe 
on all these cattle fed capsules half-happy for babel, 
I ain’t no adder of ‘posed ta and reins 
I got the powder of gun on run in my veins 
And all that’s under my name 

“long time coming” feat….lionesque 
if only I could make it 
to a place where forsaken’s not a maiden or a mat idée 
(when isn’t it though) 
ready to play the host where I dine 
on my lines of life in which my eyes perceive 
(then let your jaws show) 
I be happy supplied the world with food for thought 
 mission a national fee 
But Now I have risen from that dream 
Faced up blatant with the statements 
I envision in the scenes 
Robbers of the raw 
And the innocent’s defeat 
Province of the poor, underprivileged, and the 
Weak 
(wwweak) 
seek only what brings acceptance a the tidings in my findings 
(or get eat) 
cease 
now hear me sing 
if resting where you find me 
understand my offering 
takes my last breaths on the alter, spare me please 
no one here, solitude’s the conclude 
in the city of the written 
my reflection sees me through 
it’s a pity, didn’t listen now they 
suck in sour mood 
presumed to walk another tune, puckered all the poets motionless 
 though they moving down the path where pigs are roasting 
a feast for the fable coming from the frau speak it 
cause I seen it 
in the natural cause of conflict 
where blinders got me 
reaching for the chainsaw 
freedom from the feint’s fall 
crumble but was stood tall 
so see its not a paper chase 
I know that paper flakes beside a fires blaze 
My bridge is on another plane buried by the bush underneath the lily cactus, 
Unearthed with every practice 
only like minds can catch it 
Not many at my heels but any if they will 
I move on em passioned 
If its she who you after 

i ain’t a blast from the past 
I’m what’s smashing in the future 
Hold back nothing 
Long time coming 

How they gonna show me to the gallows, 
like they could do the dent of my death 
 know my throw and resolve by the steps 
 why I oughta truth you all cold 
hard like attacked hearts fold 
under the very mud that they pump, 
you trapped sold or semi-precious lump… 
left to slack and shrivel in the thump of chests against beds… 
Wall against heads 
Like a fist on a thread 
This ain’t gonna work 
Or is it 
when dredgeddeded from the darkest inches of what your pit did 
you’d writ with an isn’t where your oughta shoulda wroughta 
less selfish of shells coulda daughtered but welled 
deadbent and attempting to only heart it in hell 
hey yo L, what did the star say to the black when it fell 
hold back nothing long time comin…
