Whatever happened to the funky race?
A generation lost in pace,
-Wasn't life supposed to be more than this?
In this kiss I'll change your bore for my bliss
But let go off my hand and it will slip out
in the sand if you don't give me the chance
to break down the walls of attitude,
I ask nothing of you
not even your gratitude

And if you think I'm corny
then it will not make me sorry
it's your right to laugh at me
and in turn, that's my opportunity
to feel brave
because ridicule is no shame
oh it's just a way to eclipse hate
it's just a way to put my back straight
oh it's just a way to remain sane

Every morning I would see her getting
off the bus the picture never drops
it's like a multicoloured snapshot stuck in my brain
it kept me sane for a couple of years
as it drenched my fears
of becoming like the others
who become unhappy mothers
and fathers of unhappy kids
And why is that?
'Cause they've forgotten how to play
or maybe they're afraid to feel ashamed
to seem strange
to seem insane
to gain weight
to seem gay
- I tell you this:

That it takes a fool to remain sane
Oh It takes a fool to remain sane
Oh It takes a fool to remain sane
Oh In this world all covered up in shame
(-Oh, take it to the stage!)

So, take it to the stage in a multicoloured
jacket take it jackpot, crackpot,
strutting like a peacock
nailvarnish Arkansas
shimmy-shammy featherboah crackpot haircut
dye your hair in glowing red and blue,

-Do, Do, Do! What you wanna do, Don't think twice,
do what you have to do,
Do, Do, Do, Do, let your heart decide
what you have to do that's all there is to find

Cause it takes a fool to remain sane,
Oh It takes a fool to remain sane
Oh In this world all covered up in shame
Oh It takes a fool to remain sane,
Oh It takes a fool to remain sane
Oh It takes a fool to remain sane
Oh In this world all covered up in shame
-Oh, it takes a fool!..
