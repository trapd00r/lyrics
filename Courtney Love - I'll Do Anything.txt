Gimme your poor, yeah 
You need to be free, yeah 
Your hungry huddled masses 
Screaming me me me
Gimme danger 
Gimme sorrow

You, you, you, you do anything 

Gimme white boys skinny 
Gimme big black men 
Gimme ice cream on my birthday

Gimme white hot heat 
One day my prince will come but 
Man, it's just too late 

Gimme one match 
So I can set myself on fire 
Oh, let 'em eat cake 
Until they all starve

Gimme one light 
That pulls down on me so hard 
Twist it like a miracle 
And blast them all to shards 

Woo hoo 
Throw me up against the wall

Oh, god or the Devil

Gimme love, love, love 
Oh, give them me, me, me
