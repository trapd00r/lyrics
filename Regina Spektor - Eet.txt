It's like forgetting
the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it
You were always singing along
It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to feel the beat eeet eeeet eeet

You spend half of your life
Trying to fall behind
You're using your headphones 
To drown out your mind
It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to move your feet  eet eeet eeet

Someone's deciding
Whether or not to steal
He opens a window
Just to feel the chill
He hears that outside
A small boy just started to cry
'Cause it's his turn
But his brother won't let him try

It's like forgetting 
The words to your favorite song
You can't believe it
You were always singing along
It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to move your feet
It was so easy
And the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to feel the beat-t-t-t-t-t
