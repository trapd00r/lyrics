For your own good
For your demons 
For your husband
For your son 
For love, for Love

A life of prays
You will be coming back to us, 
for better days 
Better days.

If you are just, nights and days
If you're just, years away 
If your times released, stand still.
If you just have time to kill, time to kill.

Against all will.
Against all respect for faith. 
Against all sense.
Against love

We are locked out from your secret place.
For love.

If you are just, nights and days
If you're just, years away 
If your times released, stand still. 
You just have time to kill
