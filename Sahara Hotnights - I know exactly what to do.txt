There are a hundred pointers we don't
ever want to care about
It's time for a policy they don't want to know nothing about
Common sense and reality
words we don't like never did like
I have a (cloud beckons) over me and the wrong and the right

Oh so far away from home
I know exactly what to do

[Chorus:]
Watch him go down and down
and when we are first in line
and when we are satisfied
it's just a goodbye

And we are struggling to make sense
somehow we shocked the underworld
looking for a house yeah
looking for a place where no-one can hurt us
looking like strangers
and we are making ourselves heard

Oh so far away from home
I know exactly what to do

::Chorus::

Oh so far away from home
I know exactly what
I know exactly what to do

::Chorus::
