It will be better in the morning 
They said the sun might shine 
I'll have you close, you'll have the deeps of mine 
It will be better, much better 

Suppose it would rain 
How I would smile 
It would be pretty easy, keep you lying for a while
It will be better, much better 

It'll be so good 
It fact we don't have to do anything 
Whatever goes wrong 
We've still got everything 
It can't be better, can't be better 

It's so good, it's so good 
And better, and better
