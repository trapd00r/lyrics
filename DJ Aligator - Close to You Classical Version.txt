Send "Close to You (Classical version)" Ringtone to your Cell can't sleep at nite 
Staring at the phone 
Knowing you are not alone 

She is right there by your side 
I'm trying just to hide 
All the things I feel inside 

I can sense the chemistry 
When you are standing close to me 
I feel like a ship that's lost at sea 

It's getting harder to ignore 
It's not like anything before 
I know it's carzy baby but I want more 

I wish i could be close to you 
And feel your every move 
Neva meant to feel this way 
Maybe you would come around one day 

I wish i could be close to you 
To feel your every touch 
Becoz the sky won't heal the way I feel 
Heaven knows I've wanted it so much 
(Wanted it so much) 
(wanted it so much) 

I am the one to blame 
Trying to explain 
But I will cause myself such pain 

Your heart not your heart 
I trying to turn the time 
But time is never on my side 

I can sense the chemistry 
When your standing close to me 
I feel like a ship that's lost at sea 
It's getting harder to ignore 
It's not like anything before 
I know it's carzy baby but I want more 

(I wish that I could be so close to you) 

I wish that I could be close to you 
And feel your every move 
Neva meant to feel this way 
Maybe you would come around one day 

I wish I could be close to you 
To feel you every touch 
Becoz the sky won't heal the way i feel 
Heaven knows I've wanted it so much
