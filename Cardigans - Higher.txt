I'm glad you came around today
I sure need a good companion
I'm losing it but you're the same
without you I move at random
Abusing 'cause you're a friend
and there's no Jesus here to explain
And take me higher
come take me higher
come take me high above our time
Take me higher
oh take me higher
come take me high above our time
We'll make it out of here?oh yeah
You justify, you're not afraid
and I won't feel like this forever
You wait with me, because you know
there's so much more than this before we go
To take us higher
come take us higher
come take us high above our time
Take us higher
oh take us higher
come take us high above our time
We'll make it out of here
come take us out of here
take us anywhere?oh yeah
