ever since I was eight or nine
I've been standing on the shoreline
for all my life I've been waiting
for something lasting
you loose your hunger and you loose your way
you get confused and then you fade away

oh this town
kills you when you are young
oh this town
kills you when you are young

I'm not the boy that I used to be
this town has got the youth of me
all the eyes turn hollow
from the work of sorrow

you die young
you die when you're young
you die when you're young
we are shadows
oh were shadows
just shadows in the alley

you're standing on the paving
by the office building
they've got so much to do
never time for you

you die young
you die when you're young
you die when you're young
we are shadows
oh we're shadows
just shadows in the alley
I've got nothing
nothing to wait for
nothing to wait for
where is life
in this town
where is life in this town
