No more time, spared for waiting,
no thoughtfulness to blame it on
I'm giving up on you,
you're giving up on me
that's why our meeting doesn't come
I don't recognize my skin when it's callous
This emptiness that's replaced my heart
Don't need you anymore,
you don't need me at all
So what are we living for?
What is left, what is left?
What is left when love is gone?

Do I have to start dream about a stranger?
I'm sure he's not anywhere
It is not like me, to lose without to bleed
No I don't enjoy to feel free
This curtain fall is the last one you will see

Suddenly it's so quiet,
no voices I hear that bewail
There is nothing more,
to see or hope for
It is time for the final curtain fall
This curtain fall is the last one after all
