Deep down in Jamaica close to Mandeville 
Back up in the woods on top of a hill 
There stood an old hut made of earth and wood 
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode 

He never learned to read and a write so well 
But he could play his guitar like ringing a bell yell 

[CHORUS]
Said go, go Johnny! 
Johnny be good tonight! 
Said go, go Johnny! 
Johnny B. Goode... 

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack 
Sitting in a tree in the railroad track 
Old engineer in the train sitting in the shade 
Strummin' with the rhythm that them drivers made 

People passing by would stop and say: 
'Oh my, oh my, what the boy can play!' 

[CHORUS] 

Mama said: 'Son, you gotta be a man 
You got to be the leader of a reggae band 
People coming in from miles around 
To hear you play until the sun goes down 

Boy, someday your name will be in the lights' 
Saying: 'Johnny B, Johnny B Goode tonight'

I said go, go Johnny! 
Johnny be good tonight! 
Said go, go Johnny! 
Johnny you better be good 

[CHORUS]
