Send "The Rest Is Noise" Ringtone to your Cell Take a tip
Save your breath
The moment is passed us for now
No distractions
No applause
The less is more

How can we talk of more
When the bricks are at our feet?
We let them all fall in on us
And all because 

Wrap it up
Keep it quiet
Nobody likes a pest
To be happy
To be bored
Let the rest be noise

How can we talk of more
When the bricks are at our feet?
We let them all fall in on us
And all because
We could go back now
There'd be nothing left to find
We let them all fall in on us
They fall in on...
