(Pam Barlow/Janet Minto)


We can never change what's happened 
I guess it's time to face the fact 
You're out of my life forever 
And baby nothing's gonna bring you back 
Another lonely night is callin' 
And in my heart the rain keeps falling 

But tears don't put out the fire 
Your memory only fans the flames 
Tears don't put out the fire 
Burning in my heart, to see you again 

In my world time has no meaning 
You're gone a year, you're gone a day 
I've traveled long and hard and far 
But I'm never gonna get away 
'Cause if I stop to dream you're in it 
Your love is with me every minute 

And tears don't put out the fire 
Your memory only fans the flames 
Tears don't put out the fire 
Burning in my heart, to feel you again 

My arms are aching to hold you 
I miss you every day I live 
And tears don't put out the fire 
Or the love, I got to give 

If you could only walk back into my life 
If I could hear your sweet voice one more time 
And stop drowning in a lonely dawn 
Find a little peace, but I get no release 

And tears don't put out the fire 
Your memory only fans the flames 
Tears don't put out the fire 
Burning in my heart, to see you again 

My arms are aching to hold you 
I miss you every day I live 
And tears don't put out the fire 
Or the love, I got to, I got to give 

Tears don't put out the fire 
If you could only walk back into my life 
Tears don't put out the fire 
If I could hear your sweet voice, one more time 
Tears don't put out the fire 
Put out the fire 
Tears don't put out the fire
