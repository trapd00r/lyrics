What you gonna tell your dad
Its like a wheel of fortune
And what you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down
My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
Im not too cool

All that she wants is another baby
Shes gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
Shes gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No ones gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know 
I know 'cause I've been there with you tonight 
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven I know 
I'm a prisoner of hope I know

Its a beautiful life, oooh
Its a beautiful life, oooh
Its a beautiful life, oooh
I just wanna be here beside you
