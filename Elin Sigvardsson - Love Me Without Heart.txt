Send "If Love Can Kill I'll Die for You" Ringtone to your Cell At the first day I wanted you
and I still do want you baby
At the first kiss I got afraid
and I feel the same about your love baby

It's like a drug, dear, that swollows me
now I can't be without you baby
So give something to hold on to
some hate would do
'til your love saves me

We've had a hopeless start, but I think we can fix it
'cause if we fall apart, I know you would miss it
just as much as I would do too
I've had a homeless heart, but I'm ready to seattle it
and this restless body,I'll be able to still it
there's nothing I wouldn't do
If love can kill I'll die for you

We don't talk much nowadays
there's nothing to say
did you notice baby

How I long for your speaking voice
instead of all this noice
we've been making lately

We've had a hopeless start, but I think we can fix it
'cause if we fall apart, I know you would miss it
just as much as I would do too
I've had a homeless heart, but I'm ready to seattle it
and this restless body,I'll be able to still it
there's nothing I wouldn't do
if love can kill I'll die for you

We're in love, baby, with destruction itself
We are stuck baby, 'til we love eachother to death
But once I've loved honey, I'm keeping on
and once I'm stuck baby, I won't be gone

We've had a hopeless start, but I think we can fix it
'cause if we fall apart, I know you would miss it
just as much as I would do too
I've had a homeless heart, but I'm ready to seattle it
and this restless body,I'll be able to still it
there's nothing I wouldn't do
if love can kill I'll die for you

I'll die for you
