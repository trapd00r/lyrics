Sad eyed lady, silent sky
Don't say maybe, don't you lie
Every time I trip and fall, you smile
Every time I need that drink, you hold my hand for a while

My sister, dear sister.. you make me cry
My sister, dear sister.. Do I dare to ask you why... oh, why?

I fought comfort, I fought you
Sold my fortune, tell me what to do
Every time I trip and fall, you smile
Every time I need that drink you hold my hand for a while

My sister, dear sister.. you make me cry
My sister, dear sister.. Do I dare to ask you why... oh, why?
