Send "It's All Real" Ringtone to your Cell [Intro scratches by DJ Premier] 
*Pitch Black* 
*Realize it's all real* 
*Who wanna fuck with this?* 
*Realize it's all real* 
*Pitch Black, all my real niggaz* 
*Underground past the pavement* 
*We be wildin' on the corner...* 
*We rep the hardest* 

[Verse 1] 
1970, I was sent through a heavenly 
Spirit and I've been dead-e-ly 
As far back as my memory 
Can record the power of God was sent to me 
They gon have to mention me among the best eventually 
Pitch Black's the group of the century 
I ain't tryin to see death, disease or the penitentiary 
When the smoke screens fade, the charade's played 
Nothing remains but the foundation we layed is real 
Destroy and build, my feelings kill or be killed 
Play around, we spraying rounds, I lay you down 
No doubt you dont know what it's about 
You think you spitting game but the game spit you out 
So you ain't innovating you're regurgitating 
Poisonous thoughts, doing dirty work for Satan 
I leave you so scarred, your corpse rock hard 
Your arms are too short to box with God 
And it's all real 

[Chorus (Scratched)] 
*Pitch Black, all my real niggaz* 
*Underground past the pavement* 
*We be wildin' on the corner freestylin'* 
*It's a fact that I'm dope* 
*Realize it's all real* 
*Pitch Black, all my real niggaz* 
*Underground past the pavement* 
*We be wildin' on the corner...* 
*We rep the hardest* 
*Realize it's...* 

[Verse 2] 
Weed grammar, coke manners, dope slander, hold hammers 
Don't provoke the hand that'll choke your man up yo 
Grinding for hours cause hope is for cowards 
Trying to make more dough than flour 
Foes notice the power 
Competition and opposition get knocked out of position 
We living like we ain't got a pot to piss in 
'Nuff flows to touch souls 
Too tough to fold, too hot to hold, stop, pop, and go 
This our pie to go, our time to roll 
Out of the cold, into our zone, leave us alone, yo 
The difference between winning and losing is picking and choosing 

Your enemies, your friends to be, and who your crew is 
Let's get it together no matter the weather 
Fuck haters nothing can break us as long as we makin this chedder 
We ballin' like Lakers, we movers and shakers 
No one can do it how we do it, showing and proving 

My crew's the greatest 

[Chorus] 
*It's all real* 
*Pitch Black, all my real niggaz* 
*Underground past the pavement* 
*We be wildin' on the corner freestylin'* 
*It's a fact that I'm dope* 
*Realize it's all real* 
*Pitch Black, all my real niggaz* 
*Underground past the pavement* 
*We be wildin' on the corner...* 
*We rep the hardest* 
*Realize it's...* 

[Verse 3] 
Hey yo, with every step I take I move to build 
I'm a quarter through life and I've yet to fullfill my will 
Sometimes I feel like I'm my own worst enemy 
I make things harder when it's really elementary 
I've got soul in my heart and dirt on my hands 
'Dro in my pants, love for my mans and love for these grams 
Got fam to feed and laws to lay 
Guns to spray, blocks of hate, and workers to pay 
Dog I never burn a bridge unless I never wanna cross it 
I'm really a cool nigga so these hands don't force 'em 
I love this rap shit just bend the tracks I'm awesome 
Love to toss bitches and fantasize of foursomes 
I say what I mean, and mean what I say 
Fast and D.G., repping for B.K 

We do this the Pitch Black way 
Today's the tomorrow that you should've feared yesterday 
And it's *all real* 

[Chorus until end]
