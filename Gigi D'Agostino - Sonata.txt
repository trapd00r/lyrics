Don't wait for me
My mind runs free
Don't wait for me
I must try
Must understand
Suddenly pretend
To find the way
Lo live my way

With or without
Your certainty
Your sweet embrace
That holds me tight
So I'm blind
'Cause I can't see
What it means to be
Alone... Alone
To face my own mistakes
Or evenmore my own fate

With or without
The guarantee
That everyday
I can survive
So I'm blind
'Cause I can't see
What it means to be
Alone... Alone
To face my own mistakes
Or evenmore my own fate

With or without
A friend to share
The fantasy
Of all my dreams
So I'm blind
'Cause I can't see
What it means to be
Alone... Alone
To face my own mistakes
Or evenmore my own fate
