It's just a scratch man (Let's go Em)
[Eminem]
I  Murder  this  Inc  as soon as I touch the page
You ain't gon' have no other choice but to rush the stage
and charge the mic, and I hope you got the heart to fight
Cause you gon' have to, cause you ain't got the smarts to write
somethin that good, to try to come back at me with
What you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?
You motherfuckers crack me up
Talkin bout you gonna smack me up, y'all won't even back me up
Throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard
It's like fuckin Castor Claw tryna jack me off
You think I'm afraid?  What you tryna throw some fear in me?
You think I'm dumb enough to roll with no security? {*gun clicks*}
I'm doin my best to try to show maturity
But don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
like it's supposed to be scarin me
Like I won't leap clean over this fuckin V.I.P. rope and throw this chair
at anyone close or near me tryna approach me physically
cause he don't spit lyrically
And he knows that my flow's so sick, this hoe's on my dick
and he's so sick of hearin me, my posters is starin at him
But I don't think he knows the severity
of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
if I go hysterically; cause I guarantee
there's no one in here that would resort like a childhood
any quicker than I would, or hit you with plywood
Especially when I'm sippin on this liquor and tonic
One swig of this bottle I'ma go upside your head so hard with it
the mark
