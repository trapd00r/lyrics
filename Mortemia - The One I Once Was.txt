I cover my weary eyes
Can't face no more of this life
All I lived for is now gone
I've suffered along for far too long

I summon the strength in me
I call upon who I used to be
I summon the strength inside
But it does no longer abide

I call in vain upon who I once was
I can't regain the strength that I long since lost
