So broken,
In pieces,
My heart is so broken,
I'm puzzling.

Here I go
Trying to run ahead of that,
Heart break train,
Thinking,
It will never catch up with me.

I'm so broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
So broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm,
heðan-biður,
** Icelandic part **
Wooh-ahhh-hmm...

I'm trying to land,
This aeroplane of ours gracefully,
But it seems just destined to crash,

I'm so broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
My heart is so broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm,
** Icelandic part **

How can, how can,
And I sense
All continuity
Has vanished away
At one step at a time now baby, baby
I'm so broken
heðan-liður-afte-care
I'm-m-m-mmm...so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
** Icelandic part **

I'm so...
Completely unhealable, baby
Ohhh!!
Ohh-er-him
I'm so broken
Ahh-eða-miður-afte-care
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm
En-lickel-afte-sjólvar
En-neon-co-cole-ah-ahh
Neo-sasar-ohh
En-mi-sshh...

¿vamos a otra?? otra!!
