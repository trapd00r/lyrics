Bizzy: 
Nobody believes. Nobody believes. Nobody believes 
me, even my baby girl. See I was raised up on that 
ouija in my crazy 
world. Better take it easy. Sang: Outta my mind, 
outta my mind, outta my mind, outta my brains, brains. 
7th Sign time, in a line, 
shine, fin to bye-bye, die die, bang bang. Hit 'em 
with that woo-woo, and that flip-flop flown-n-low. 
Steady as we roll. Maybe 
you don't know, oh. Get away for safety, in a 
coma-like state, invade me. Everyone say: 'Hey, hey, 
he's crazy.' Premenitions, 
kick pushin' daisies. Wait, they chase to slay me. 
Paranoid. Mortal to the paranormal. Jumpin' out 
portals. Kinetical energy 
formal in the global get warmer. Mormons may mourn, 
may Messiahs be born, torn in the purgatory. Sworn to 
violence, silence, 
word my bond. Get ya story on, call me, saw me 
in the army gatherin' in harmony. Hardly in all we be 
so salty.

Demons surround me

Bizzy:
Talk to the walkin' dead, crossroads, call on the 
Rev., lost souls. And I'm off in a coffin' tossin' my 
memoirs, oh no. In the closet, 
come open the door, what do you see? A funeral. 
Usually closest to kosher 'til I see some loved ones, 
don't go. Get it crucial, 
pick up the psychic line, future to before time in 
the sinister mind of spiritual wicked, intertwined 
with weak souls, come kick it. 
Written, rewind, get it, look out, hit it, rise. Dig 
it, wig out, feel it, ride. Mimic, die. Nigga, fly. 
Boom bye-bye. My kind in time, 
7th Sign, 7th Sign (7th Sign). Time after time get 
mine, gon' get mine. Pick up the phone line, pick up 
the phone line, ready for 
truth on the loose? Got a dime or two and I'm 
liable to tell you, only if you know, wooo. He flew 
right bye you, true, demons 
follow and resume from the womb in the tomb. I fool 
you, boom, boom, boom. B-b-b-boom, boom, boom, boom, 
boom, boom.
