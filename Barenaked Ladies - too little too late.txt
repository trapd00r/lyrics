You say, "Why does everything revolve around you?"
You say, "Why does everything I do confound you?"
You say, that I pull the world from under you
You can't go through it this time

And I can be good, and I would - if I knew I was understood
And it'll be great, just wait - Or is it too little too late?

One day, this embarrassment will fade behind me
And that day, I could think of things that won't remind me
And these days it's unbearable for both of us,
We can't discuss it this way

I'm gaining strength, trying to learn to pull my own weight
I'm gaining pounds at the precipice of too late
Just wait

And I can be good, and I would - if I knew I was understood
And it'll be great, just wait - Or is it too little too late?

Record and play, after years of endless rewind
Yesterday wasn't half as tough as this time
This time isn't Hell
Last time, couldn't tell
This mind wasn't well 
Next time, hope I'm...

Going to be good, and I would
If I knew I was understood 
And it'll be great, just wait 
Or is it too little too late?
