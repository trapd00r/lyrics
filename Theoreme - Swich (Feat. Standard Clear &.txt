Push the button elevator no tobira tojite
mugen ni We goin' up and down oshitsudzukete, 
konna Play no kurikaeshi
kono Trip kara mukou wa michi naru sekai
Step into the floor zureta kankaku Slowly modoshi, 
I am still me akarui Story
  Push the button, close the elevator door
  We goin' up and down endlessly, continue to push [the buttons]
  We just repeat this play
  The other side of this trip is an unknown world
  Step into the floor, a sensation that slips, slowly return, 
  I am still me, cheerful Story

Time is game, koko wa itsuka kita basho, 
from today no jinsei nanika kawarisou
kage ni hikarisasu, yume ga saisei suru
  Time is game, this is a place I came to someday, 
  from today, life looks like it'll change
  Shining in the shadows, the dream plays back

* Life's what you imagine, kagiri nai uchuu no you de
mitsuketa mono wa  tatoe nakushitemo
Searching for the moment sagashitsudzukete itai ne,
sou  [KOUDA KUMI]  ki ga sumu made
Life's what you imagine, misugoshitemo  aru beginning
furikaeru no wa ikiteku hint dakara
Searching for the moment, shinjitsu wo dakishimete,
[KOUDA KUMI]  kowaku nante nai  [LISA]  jiyuu ni naru yo
  Life's what you imagine, even if what I found is lost
  like the limitless universe
  Searching for the moment, I want to continue searching,
  Yes, till I'm satisfied
  Life's what you imagine, even if you overlook it, there's a beginning
  Looking back is a hint that you go on living, so
  Searching for the moment, hold onto the truth,
  I won't be afraid, I'll become free

** Switchin' on and off like day and night
dare no kotoba ni mo yuraganai
kikoeru ka, I can do this right,
watashi wa watashi de kuzurenai
iranai koe wa keshite yuku,
basically I really don't got time for you
jibun kara, right into the heart,
keiken dake de tsunaideku
  Switchin' on and off like day and night
  I won't be swayed by anyone's words
  Can you hear me?, I can do this right,
  I won't collapse myself
  The voices I don't need will disappear, 
  basically I really don't got time for you
  From myself, right into the heart,
  I will go on with just my experiences

[KOUDA KUMI]
Volume agete hora karada uzukidasu  
I can hear my name mizukara ga yomigaeru
[JEWELS]
So DJ switch me "PURE-MO-DO" 
on & off SURO- as I take off 
[RUM]
just close your eyes and feel the beat blow 
cause tonight we don't stop till the sun come up 
  Turn up the volume, listen! My body begins to ache  
  I can hear my name, I'm revived
  So DJ switch me to "play mode" 
  on & off, slow as I take off 
  just close your eyes and feel the beat blow 
  cause tonight we don't stop till the sun come up

Destiny nara matsu yori mo ou, 
seikaku nara keikaku tooriugoku
Feel the light mabushiku naru, yume ga saisei suru
  If it's destiny, I'd rather chase it than wait
  If that's my character, I'll move through the plan
  Feel the light, I get dizzy; the dream plays back

Life's what you imagine, kagiri nai uchuu no you de
kagayaki abita, kokoro no chizu wa
Searching for the moment kiete wa torimodoshite,
sou  chikaradzuku de
Life's what you imagine, owari no nai new beginning
machigaeru no wa ikiru subarashisa
Searching for the moment, shinjitsu wo dakishimete,
[KOUDA KUMI]  isoide yuku yo,  [LISA]  jiyuu ni naru yo
  Life's what you imagine, like the limitless universe
  The map of my heart is bathed in the brilliance
  Searching for the moment, I'll take back what disappeared,
  yes, I'll take it by force
  Life's what you imagine, new beginning with no end
  Making mistakes is the phenomenon of living
  Searching for the moment, hold onto the truth,
  I'll hurry on, I'll become free

visions never clear
tooku e to saratte yuku  keshiki nomikonde
I believe, I'm me, nobody but me
dare no ikizama demo nai
  visions never clear
  I'll take you far away, & drink in the scenery
  I believe, I'm me, nobody but me
  There is no one else existing

HA-TSU da big da boom da boom BAAM!

V.I.P. yuusen ban PI- no retsu is that way
mukou no houkou so lay that ass low

  Hearts da big da boom da boom BAAM!
  outta the way!! comin' thru  So make way
  V.I.P. preference, the line for the general public is that way
  It's the opposite direction, so lay that ass low
  get dirty on the flow
  I bet everything "yo! generous"
  I'm the longshot aiming gambler

hajimattara we can't stop
I'm the ooana nerai no GYANBURA-
  CHIKICHIKI BANBAN CHIKI BANBAN
  I surf the beat, CHIKI BANBAN
  One shot, just aim for a reversal
  With the game switch you'll be at the top
  one for the money two for the show 
  three Heartsdales sisters' appearance
  When we start, we can't stop
  I'm the longshot aiming gambler
