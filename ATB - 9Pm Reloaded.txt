I've got something on my mind,
But the right words are so hard to find
They twist my mind
Grapevine's shakin once again
Those nasty little rumours of the pointed pen
are loose again

Sliding in the door are the roads we all know
Yesterdays heroes with no room to grow
You say you want the money
You want the Big Prize
But they'll cut you down to size , with your

BAD ATTITUDE, twisted views (Bad, bad attitude)
Two can play that game, no one likes to lose, yeah! 

What's it like living like you do
Talk talk is cheap talk
So far from the truth
Why do they listen to you?

Soon you will fall boy, record shows
Your own little stories will turn on you
Best be on your toes
There's such a thing as trust,

Nothing else is the same
When your face is in the ground,
You've only yourself to blame,

You say you want the money
You want the Big Prize
But they'll cut you
Down to size , with your
BAD ATTITUDE, twisted views

It's your Bad Attitude,
Bad bad attitude
It's your Bad Attitude, twisted views
No one likes to lose, no one likes to lose
Bad bad attitude,
Two can play that game, no one likes to lose, yeah!
