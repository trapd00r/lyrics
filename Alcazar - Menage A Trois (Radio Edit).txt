Send "Ménage À Trois" Ringtone to your Cell En, deux - ménage a trois
Oh la la
Mais oui, Monsieur et Madame
Tonight we're gonna boogie pour vous
Ouh oui!

Chorus:
Would you like to come to our ménage a trois
There's room for one more body in our boudoir
Would you like to try a little un, deux, trois
Everyone will get a change to be a star

Hey there, sexy, what you doing
You're looking kinda lonely over there
Me and my baby, we wanna party
And we'd love for you to join us if you dare

Bridge:
Twice is nice but three's is divine 
What's her's, is your's, is ours, is mine
If you're in the middle, better hold on tight

(Chorus)

Oh, come and get it
You wont regret i
We can promise satisfaction guaranteed
And we can keep it our little secret
Keep it between you and her and me

(Bridge and Chorus)

Would you dare to join us in our chambre sé'parée
Come a little closer, oh yeah, very enchanté

Réspondent, réspondent, réspondent s'il vous plait 2x

(Chorus 2x)

This is night to make it right
No one can know, we'll keep it our night
(repeat until fade)
