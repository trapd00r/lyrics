oh!oh! ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for,
in this corner, weighing 175 pounds,
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
the undisputed, most diabolical villian in the world,
Slim Shady!

[Eminem]
So crack a bottle,
let your body waddle,
don't act like a snobby model,
you just hit the lotto,
uh-oh uh-oh,
bitches hoppin in my Tahoe,
got one riding shotgun,
no not one of em got clothes,
now where's the rubbers?
who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and
there's really not that many of us,
ladies love us and my posse's kickin up dust,
It's on till the break of dawn,
and we're starting this party from dusk,

Ok, let's go!

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk.
Fix your must, youll just be another one bit the dust .
Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus.
Kiss my butt, Lick Fromunda cheese from under my nuts.
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks,
Its a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed,
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut,
Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut,
Now picture us, Its ridiculous you curse at the thought,
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cuz your soft,
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time,
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes,
Its elementary, The elephants have entered the room,
I venture to say with the center of attention its true,
Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal,
Of the bat symbol, The platinum trio's back on you hoes,

So crack a bottle,
let your body waddle,
don't act like a snobby model,
you just hit the lotto,
uh-oh uh-oh,
bitches hoppin in my Tahoe,
got one riding shotgun,
no not one of em got clothes,
now where's the rubbers?
who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and
there's really not that many of us,
ladies love us and my posse's kickin up dust,
It's on till the break of dawn,
and we're starting this party from dusk,

Ladies and Gentlemen;
Dr. Dre!

[Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like Oh my!
You aint got to tell me why youre sick cuz I know why,
I dip through in that six trey, like sick em Dre,
Im an itch that they cant scratch, theyre sick of me,
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day,
And this one begins where the last one ends,
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again,
Ill be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz,
Driving around with a smashed front end,
Lets cash that one in,
Grab another one from out the stable,
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado?
The hell if I know,
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, Garage looks like precision collision,
Or maico beats quake like Waco,
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though.

50 Cent!

[50 Cent]
It's bottle, after bottle,
The money aint a thang When you party with me,
Its what we into, its simple,
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe,
Im the napalm, the bomb, the don, im king kong,
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on,
Im so calm through vietnam, ring the alarm,
Bring the shaun dawn burn marajaun do what you want,
Nigga on and on till the break of what,
Get the paper man im caking you know, i dont give a fuck,
I spend it like it dont mean nothing,
Blow it like its suposed to be blown,
Motherfucker im grown,

Fat ass burgandy bags classy shit jimmy cho shoes,
I say move-a-bitch, move.
