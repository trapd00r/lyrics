I never return to love somebody
Now all that I need is all I see in you
And only you
And if you get lost I'll always find you
You're all that I need your heart will keep you true
My only you

[Bridge]
You make me fall and I can't sleep
You want it all but it's too deep
And I can't give it away
I just can't give it away

[Chorus 1]
When you slowly close your eyes
replay the moment in your life
Just give it away
Just give it away
When you slowly close your eyes
replay the moment in your life
Just give it away
Just give it away

[Verse 2]
Don't ever forget to tell somebody
The feelings inside to make your dreams come true
I dream of you
To feel so alive and want somebody
It's not make believe my world would be for you
And only you

[Bridge]
You make me fall and I can't sleep
You want it all but it's too deep
And I can't give it away
I just can't give it away

[Chorus 2]
When you slowly close your eyes
replay the moment in your life
Breathe in and give it away
Breathe out and give it away
When you slowly close your eyes
replay the moment in your life
Breathe in and give it away
Breathe out and give it away

[Repeat Bridge and Chorus 2 till end]
