If you gave me just a coin
For every time we say goodbye ...
Well, I'd be rich beyond my dreams
I'm sorry for my weary life

I know I'm not perfect
But I can smile
And I hope that you see this heart
Behind my tired eyes

If you tell me that I can't
I will, I will, I'll try all night
And if I say I'm coming home
I'll probably be out all night

I know I can be afraid
But I'm alive
And I hope that you trust this heart
Behind my tired eyes
Cause

I'm no angel, but please don't think that I won't try and try
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I can't live my life?
I'm no angel, but please don't think that I can't cry
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I won't fly?

I know I'm not around each night
And I know I always think I'm right
And I can believe that you might look around
Cause

I'm no angel, but please don't think that I won't try and try
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I can't live my life?
I'm no angel, but please don't think that I can't cry
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I won't fly?
