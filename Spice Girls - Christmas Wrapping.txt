"Bah! Humbug" - no, that's too strong 
Cos it's my favorite holiday 
But all this year's been a busy blur 
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush 
Just because it is the season 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from 
Last year, world tour
aeroplanes and babies,
Met some guys but never the time 
Most of '98 passed along those lines 
So deck the halls and trim those trees 
Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer 
I just need to catch my breath 
Christmas with my mates this year 

Calendar picture, frozen landscape 
Chilled this room for twenty-four days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow 
Get this winter over with!
Flashback to springtime, saw him again 
Would've been good to go for a lunch 
Couldn't agree we were both free 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch 
We didn't, of course, 'till the summertime 
Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him? 
No, this time it was me 
Sunburn in the third degree 
Now the calendar's just one page 
And, of course, I am excited 
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it 

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

Hardly dashing through the snow 
Cos I bundled up too tight 
Last minute have-to-do's 
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's R-S-V-P 
No thanks, no party lights 
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax 
Turned down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself 
Same guy called, halloween party 
Waited all night for him to show 
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late 
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quiet way, unwind 
Doing Christmas right this time 

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 

Tesco has provided me 
With the world's smallest turkey 
Already in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?
So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow 
To the only all-night garage
But when to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year 
"Spending this one alone," he said
"Need a break; this year's been crazy." 
I said, "Me too, but why are you? 
You mean you forgot the papers too?"
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening 
That Christmas magic's brought this tale 
To a very happy ending 

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year
