P.e wit her, wee wee, eazy, ol me, ol g little me lick her
So she need liquor never seem sicker, nigga if rap was hash
She could beat twista
Had her alley to alley, hawai and maui, and cali the valley
Up in white lotus dog you might notice

And hope is hopeless, dissapaer in the air hocus pocus

Females better twirl on yours, better curl on yours
Cause i swirl off shores (then what) come back to a pearl golf course (who you?)
Im corrupt, cause girls are whores, and the world is yours, honey sip sizurp hurl of course
And you know im in the buildin mister, wit the olsen twins, or the hilton sisters
And i haul em in to the hiltons mister
I milked them, i killed them, you quilt them, you missed her (missed her)
You held her, you kissed her
You felt all the blisters, melt on your whiskers

[chorus 2x]
