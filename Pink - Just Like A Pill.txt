I'm lying here 
On the floor, where you left me
I think I took too much

I'm crying here 
What have you done?
I thought it would be fun

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get out of here

Where I can run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
'staid of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills, they were different
Maybe I should get some help

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get out of here

Where I can run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me (ill)

Run, just as fast as i can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch (just like a pill)
I can't stay on your morphine
Cause it's making me itch (just like a pill)
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch (just like a pill)
I think I'll get out of here

Where I can run as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You're making me ill
You keep making me

Run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
'stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

Run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
'stead of making me better
You keep making me ill
You keep making me ill

Run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
