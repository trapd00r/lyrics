(Chorus 1):
Sugar in the mornin'
Sugar in the evenin'
Sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar
And love me all the time
Honey in the mornin'
Honey in the evenin'
Honey at suppertime
Be my little honey
And love me all the time

[?someone else?]
Sugar, if you want me
Sugar, if you need me
Sugar, if you think I'm fine
You know I love you, sugar
So be my girl tonight
Honey, if you want me
Honey, if you need me
Honey, if you think I'm fine
Just give me all your sweet lovin'
and be my girl tonight

[Cash]

(Chorus1)

Now sugar time (now sugar time)
is anytime (is anytime)
Now sugar time (now sugar time)
is anytime (is anytime)
Now sugar time (now sugar time)
is anytime (is anytime)

Now don't you roam
just be my honeycomb

(Chorus1)

[Someone else]
Sugar in the water 
Sugar in the coffee
Sugar in the wine
If loving you is sugar
I'd take sugar all the time
Honey if you want me
Honey if you need me
Honey if you think I'm fine

I got sugar all around me
I got sugar in my mouth

[Cash]
Put your arms around me (Now, now lay ya hands on me)
You'll be mine forever (Now I have something to say)

(Chorus1)

Suga-suga sugartime
Suga-suga sugartime
Suga-suga sugartime
