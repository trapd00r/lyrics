Out in the fields 
Where the farmers grow bread 
When called for the meals 
They took for the shed 
Then dark came to fall 
And silence was all 
A beauty shone bright 
Surrounded by light 

c'mon now; 

I fell in love with an Alien 
Fell in love with her eyes 
Fell in love with an Alien 
I’m telling you no disguise 
I’m in love with an Alien 
I’m in love with her eyes 
I’m in love with an Alien 
I’m telling you no disguise 

She came looking out babe 
for a Romeo ‘caus 
She ain’t looking out babe 
for a homeboy 
I'm in love with an Alien 
I'm in love with her eyes 
I'm in love with an Alien 
I’m telling you no disguise 

The moon went to bed 
The sun growing red 
A scarecrow appeared 
And chased her in fear 
She send me her love 
Her love to me 
And then we did grow 
A big family 

c'mon now; 

Fell in love with an Alien 
Fell in love with her eyes 
Fell in love with an Alien 
I’m telling you no disguise 
I’m in love with an Alien 
I’m in love with her eyes 
I’m in love with an Alien 
I’m telling you no disguise 

She came looking out babe 
for a Romeo ‘caus 
She ain’t looking out babe 
for a homeboy 

Fell in love with an Alien 
Fell in love with her eyes 
Fell in love with an Alien 
I’m telling you no disguise 
I’m in love with an Alien 
I’m in love with her eyes 
I’m in love with an Alien 
I’m telling you no disguise
