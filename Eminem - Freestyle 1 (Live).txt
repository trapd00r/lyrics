Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I`m sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (MOOOOO!)
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with +Agent Orange+
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!)
The demon is here, steamin this year
I rip [*Mystikal`s*] voicebox out, scream in his ear (AHHHHHH!)
It`s not a gimmick bitch, it`s an image I live it
Give a fuck? I don`t know what a fuck is to give it
`Yeah I don`t think this guy is well..` I`m high as hell
I`ll beat you with a live cat when I`m swinging him by his tail

[* impersonating Method Man *]
I`ll fuckin, I`ll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that

You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who`s itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I`m iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?) Wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You`ll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and `Pac joke
