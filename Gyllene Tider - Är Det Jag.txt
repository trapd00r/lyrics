Send "Young Girl" Ringtone to your Cell Put your head in my shoulder, baby
if you need sympathy
Young girl, can't you see, 
we can stay together, you and me

And put your little hand in mine, 
and stand by my side
Young girl, it's alright
no aim's right when the feelings are fine

Young girl, got myself a young girl, I take it to my heart
Young girl, found myself a young girl, I take it to my heart
no, we'll never part, got myself a young girl
young girl, young girl, I take it to my heart.

Put your arms around me baby, 
if you need love and care 
Anytime, anywhere 
whenever you need me, I'll be there

And put your little hand in mine, 
talk to the moon above
young girl, and love
I can't get enough, no I can't get enough. 

Young girl, got myself a young girl...
