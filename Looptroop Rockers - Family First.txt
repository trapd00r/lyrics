Supreme:
What would I do without my band of brothers,
even though we sometimes cant stand each other
like when i was a kid and they ran for cover
when the big boys showed up and they had me covered
a dap on the shoulder like you be easy
so ima stand up when the next man needs me
and im a blow up when we drop our CD
cuz ya'll show love when you know we need it
and angie dont you worry im being honest
as long im alive i got you i promise
grew up to me a loyal dude i got honor
and we a family now i did warn you
so im a go out and be somebody
i got bigtime backup embee beside me
got the love of my life and she sleeps beside me
so im all set to go cmon we audi

Promoe:
its another one hits from the fucking tons
different from the rest of the pack and second to none
another record done dance like its a reggaeton
i put it on with myfam when im having fun
put it on with my people when we shed tears
alot of that latley cus in recent years
some of our family members gone
no theyre not gone only in their physical form
i feel how their memory lingers on
and their souls help me out when in singing the song

.................

this is for my family began with my crew it will end with my crew
for my family what im doing im doing for you
this is for my family it began with my crew it will end with my crew
this is for my some aint with us but you still with us
