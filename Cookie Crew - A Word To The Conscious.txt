Yes, darling
Love it

Talk about females, we got a lot to say
There's all kinds working rap in this world today
Females, 'cause we're sick and tired
Of who is gonna rap, why don't you all retire?

We keep hearing stories about this and that
But don't they understand that they all are wet?
Females, they like to talk
'Bout cookies rocking jams but that I'm full

They look you in your face with a real big (Smile)
And then you see their make-up is a pile, all pile
With the real short skirts and high-heeled shoes
They see us in our jeans and then they try to abuse

But let us tell you something, that you're all bad news

Females, they like to think they're nice
Because they're the ones that are so precise
Females, like friends they act
But when you turn around they stab you in your back

Tryin' to take a style of clothes, it's not a fashion show

And why?
Females, they wear a lot of gold
Be careful, homeboys, because they're ten years old

They like to talk
'Bout cookies rocking jams but that I'm full

We keep hearing stories 'bout girls givin' trouble
But don't mess with girls when we start to bubble
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble

Come on, Michelle, when you hear us rap
I wanna hear you all scream, we wanna hear your hand-clap
'Cause it's the Cookie Girls, the mic-controllers
It's like that and nobody told us

Homeboys in the place party, ready to rap
You get your thigh heeled boots to get the film of the chap
And all you pickers out there who wanna get involved Don't act stupid if you think it's all
