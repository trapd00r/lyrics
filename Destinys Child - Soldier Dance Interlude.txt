Damn baby you got me open
Your heart
Is so big
You buy anything Kelly be wantin'
You're just

Ooh that way that you be talkin'
Has gotten my attention
And I ain't doing nothin' but listenin'

Ain't no one like you
That makes me want to kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin'
The game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me want to touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin'
The game is over

My Boy

So complex
You'd never think he's from the projects
He's my
Best Friend
Perfect fit for a husband

He's got his little mama's mind bent

Thank God you sent him to save me
My joy, woo my joy
His style is so amazing
My heart is open heal taking

Ain't no one like you
That makes me want to kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin'
The game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me want to touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin'
The game is over

Oh my man my man
He does whatever it takes to satisfy me
This man this man
He knows me inside out
My wants and my needs
His ways are so unique
The way he protects me
No price
No Ring
No House
No material thing
Could ever take him from me

Ain't no one like you
No, no, no, no
Ain't no one like you
No, no, no, no

Ain't no one like you
That makes me want to kiss like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin'
The game is over
Ain't no touch like you
That makes me want to touch like you
Nobody ever could handle this like you
For anybody askin'
The game is over
