No one can save
The pure or the brave
No one can save them at all
Grow and decay
Grow and decay
It's only forever
It's only forever

Loosely or tightly
Everything fits
Even the wrists on your arm
Grow and decay
Grow and decay
It's only forever
It's only forever
It's only forever
It's only forever
It's only forever....
