You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
Cause you a bug-a boo
You buggin' What?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' Me and don't you see it ain't cool

Its not hot
That you be callin' me stressin me pagin' my beeper you're just non-stop
And its not hot 
That you be leavin' me messages Every 10 minutes and then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already had my mailbox full

So what
You bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what
My momma likes you (Likes you)
What now I guess you think I will too
Even if the pope he said he likes you too
I dont really care cause you're a bug a boo

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo (bug-a boo)
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
Cause you a bug-a boo
You buggin' What?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' Me and don't you see it ain't cool

(Verse 4)
Its not hot that when im blockin' your phone number
You call me from over your best friends house
And its not hot
That I can't even go out with my girlfriends without you trackin' me down
You need to chill out with that mess
Cause you can't keep havin' me stressed
Cause everytime my phone rings it seems to be you
And I'm prayin' that it is someone else

So what
You bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what (So what)
My momma likes you (Likes you)
What now I guess you think I will too
Even if the pope he said he likes you too
I dont give a damn cause you're a bug a boooooohhhhoooohhhhh.....

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles (Cut the phone poles)
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo (But-a booooo a-booo a-booo)
I wanna put your number on the call block (Call)
Have AOL make my e-mail stop (Block)
Cause you a bug-a boo
