Send "Paper cup words" Ringtone to your Cell I'll let it burn. 
Words in a dirty paper cup. 
And Im gonna turn, cause Ive had it with this place for now. 
Im gonna find shelter where you cant call me, where you cant grab me. 

If I got to choose, had the opportunity to switch location or set my mind on whatever I wanted to,
I would take it right away from you.

You brought me in and you spoke in tongues about what lies within. 
About your little fire. 
You brought me in and you didnt even see how my tears ran. 
I was too tired to listen to you then

Saturday night. 
Youve got taste for fireside. 
Its open mike at kings head downtown, but I cant manage to get myself there somehow. 
A million reasons just to sit along here and speak to the telly and listen to your conversations

You brought me in and you spoke tongues about what lies within. 
About your little fire. 
You brought me in and you didnt even see how my tears ran. 
I was too tired to listen to you then. 

I'll let it burn, words in a broken paper cup.
