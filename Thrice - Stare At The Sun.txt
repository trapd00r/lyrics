I sit here clutching useless lists 
Keys for doors that don't exist 
I crack my teeth on pearls 
Tear into the history 
Show me what it means to me in this world
Yeah in this world 

'Cause I am due for a miracle 
I'm waiting for a sign 
I'll stare straight into the sun 
And I won't close my eyes 
'Til I understand or go blind 

I see the parts but not the whole 
Study saints and scholars both 
But no perfect plan unfurls 
Do I trust my heart or just my mind?
Why is truth so hard to find in this world? 
Yeah in this world 

'Cause I am due for a miracle 
I'm waiting for a sign 
I'll stare straight into the sun 
And I won't close my eyes 
'Til I understand or go blind 

I know that there's a point I missed 
A shrine or stone I haven't kissed 
A scar that never graced my wrist 
A mirror that hasn't met my fist 
But I can't help feeling like 

I'm due for a miracle 
I'm waiting for a sign 
I'll stare straight into the sun 
And I won't close my eyes

Due for a miracle 
I'm waiting for a sign 
I'll stare straight into the sun
And I won't close my eyes.
