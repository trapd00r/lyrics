I live in Tigerland I'm an indiana man
I'm used to walk around with a snake in my hann
Dr Bombay is my name and my father has the same 
But everything it changed here in Tigerland

S O S  the tiger took my father
S O S  the tiger took my brother
S O S  the tiger took my mother
S O S  the tiger took my family

We lived outside Calcutta in a little wooden house
I lived there with my family and 21 cows
But now they all are gone and life is not so fun
But what can you expect here in Tigerland

S O S  the tiger took my father
S O S  the tiger took my brother
S O S  the tiger took my mother
S O S  the tiger took my family

One day in the warm jungle the Tiger took my snake
It wasn't really fun it was a big mistake
I took my brother's slingshot and shot the tiger down (Bang!)
This is howw we do it here in Tigerland

S O S  the tiger took my father
S O S  the tiger took my brother
S O S  the tiger took my mother
S O S  the tiger took my family
