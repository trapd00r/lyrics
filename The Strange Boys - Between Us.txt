It must be something psychological 
It may be something very physical 
That makes me feel the way I do 
Whenever i'm in touch with you
 
I think it's something strange and mystical 
It might be something very chemical 
What is this force between us two 
That makes me gravitate to you

I know you're not my ego ideal
You aren't like my father or brother
But the way I feel __ not become
A sister, a pal or a mother
Still...

It must be something psychological 
It may be something very physical 
That makes me feel the way I do 
Whenever i'm in touch with you

It's something psychological

I know you're not my ego ideal
You aren't like my father or brother
But the way I feel __ not become
A sister, a pal or a mother

My yearning's really quite explainable
I want you 'cause you're unattainable
Just let me get my hands on you
And then I want somebody new

With me it's psychological
