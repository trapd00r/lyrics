Send "Well" Ringtone to your Cell I wasn't able to deal with the pain and the loss
And the darkness would surround me
What could've been? What should've been?
Pain

And with the state of affairs and the way that I was
I took a pistol from the closet
I loaded a round, I opened my mouth
Closed my eyes, said goodbye
Then 'click'

I would find
Another way

Now I was able to tell it was stupid as hell
And the guilt was overwhelming
Oh how could I do something to you
Like that which had been done to me

I'm guessing either I'm dead or I'm lucky instead
And the shame of this will haunt me
Then strange voices started making noises
Out of something boring
Then I made my choice to

Find
Another way
Yes, I would
Find
Another way, yeah

Cuz I can barely eat
And I can barely sleep
And I can barely think of anything but?

"Well, "Well"

Yeah, I can barely eat
And I can barely sleep
And I can barely think of anything but?

"Well, Well, Well"

Because the weight of the world was amusing to some
We would sign a record contract
And then you, her to me,
Said you got worse to me
And brought supplies when I was sick

Now I'm dirty, in doubt and I'm empty as hell
I knew better from the onset
Of a party in a limousine
With faces from a magazine
A stripper sitting next to me
Just begging me to let her go and

Find
Another way
Would you find
Another way, yeah

Cuz I can never eat
And I can never sleep
And I can never think of anything but?

"Well, Well"

Yeah, I can never eat
And I can barely breathe
And I can barely speak of anything but?

"Well, Well, Well"

Because no one
Ever
Really
Could love me
No one
Ever should

Yeah, no one
Ever
Really
Should love me
No one
Ever would

No one
Ever
Really
Could love me
No one
Ever would

Yeah, no one
Ever
Really
Should love me
No one
Ever would
