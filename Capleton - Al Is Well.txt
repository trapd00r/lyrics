Say music is a mission and me burn alms house 
From the north coast to the south coast

Some brothers are carrying uzis 
Some brothers are carrying tech-nines 
Some brothers are carrying mac-tens 
Stop the killing 
Stop doing crime 

From the east to the west 
I give all due respect 
Release the stress off your chest 
Please take away your pain my brother 
Why do we kill one another 
Cause the elevation keeps my head right on tight alright 
Levitate my mind 
Mmm mmm all my people sing 
If what you're looking for is real love 
Then unity is what you'll
