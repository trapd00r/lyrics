[2pac] (from Homeboyz)
Now everytime I see you cats is rollin in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
out on the streets you don't hear a peep
nigga it's a god damn shame, somebody explain
why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
niggaz aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a f*ck motherf*ckers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
cause you ain't shit without your homeboys

[DMX] (from What's my name?)
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo
What's my name? DMX and I be the best
You see the rest they lookin like they need a rest
One more time, I'mma spit at you some shit
That's gon get at you be fuckin with your mind, stop talkin shit
Cuz you out there runnin' your mouth
And really don't know who you fuckin with
Here we go again
How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas?
I have no friends you still actin up
Runnin around here like some brand new pussy that's about to get fucked
The game don't stop, I'm still gettin down for whatever
Whenever that's why my shit is hot, can't keep it real
Now, some of us do but most of us don't that's just how a nigga feel
I shed blood, for my people that'll keep you lookin see-through
Whenever you try to creep through
D-M-X

[Puff Daddy] (from Hate me Now)
You think I'ma come this far, and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!!

[Nas] (from Hate me Now)
You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
but keep gettin money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga, nuttin to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect hoe?
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right
