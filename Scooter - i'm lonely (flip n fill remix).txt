'Cause I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
There's no one in this world for me but you

Oh Lord, I'm a very sharp sword
Number one upon the billboard
It's the effect you don't expect
You never know what's coming next

So get a grip quick, drop a gear, running high to the sky
Till you fly
Like a killer in Manila
I make you shiver
My name is MC I

Baby
I don't want you to go
I love you so
More than you will ever know
Lately
I only made you cry
But don't you say goodbye
Won't you give me one more try

'Cause I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
I need your body by my side
To get me through these endless nights
I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
There's no one in this world for me but you

Alright
Yeah
Pull 'em up

So get a grip quick, drop a gear, we progress and express
We're coming fresh
The appliance of the science
We getting strong, oh yes
And we're dressed for success

Lately
I only made you cry
But don't you say goodbye
Won't you give me one more try

'Cause I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
I need your body by my side
To get me through these endless nights
I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
There's no one in this world for me but you
