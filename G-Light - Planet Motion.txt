Subject: I Saw The Light

I Saw the Light
---------------
Words and music by Hank Williams Sr.

I [G] wandered so aimless life filed with sin
I [C] wouldn't let my dear saviour [G] in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord [D7] I saw the [G] light.

CHORUS
I saw the light I saw the light
[C] No more darkness no more [G] night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord [D7] I saw the [G] light.

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

CHORUS

I was a fool to wander and astray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

CHORUS

~Gene L. Graham &lt;ah827@rgfn.epcc.Edu&gt;~
