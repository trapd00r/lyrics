Send "Substitute" Ringtone to your Cell I am the puppeteer
the lord of string
a king controll
See how my fingers sweep

I carry the master key
I stear the nervecenter
I am the well of thirst
I am the cell of birth

So you're now my heroine
I wish you well
I wish you everything

I am the pilot of rain
A virus insane
A moodconstructor
A sad seductor

I make you my heroine
my rush of adrenaline
we dance in silense
ignoring the violence

So you're now my heroine
I wish you well
I wish you everything

I am the pilot as we fly
(I will wave the last goodbye)
you're the passanger by my side

So you're now my heroine
I wish you well
I wish you everything
