Send "Long Distance Call (25 Hours a Day remix)" Ringtone to your Cell Where to go I had no idea 
26.10 was the price to pay 
A messed up kid with no ideals at all 
I thought those 26.10 I shouldn't give'em away 

I remember this young guy died and I took his part He got far too many stitches on his pretty face Long time to see but I always thought us two would be serious I was looking around town, thinking the same as you 

I'm far gone but your long distance call And your capital letters keep me asking for more 

It's never been like that 
It's never been like that 

I'm far gone but your long distance call And your capital letters keep me asking for more 

Where to go I had no idea about it 
Most of the people do, there're only doing just fine I don't wanna stay in place no more, see Ain't doing well well well, I am only doing just fine 

long time no see, long time no say 
Got little to tell, I don't say much but I might Something always told me us two would be serious I am looking around town, thinking the same as you 

I'm far gone but your long distance call And your capital letters keep me asking for more 

It's never been like that 
It's never been like that 

I'm far gone but your long distance call And your capital letters keep me asking for more 

Long time no see... Long time no say...
