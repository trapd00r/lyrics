Yo 
Check it out 
It's fucked up 
Cuz I dont see either one of us budgin' 

Verse 1 
Im with-holding my anger 
Though id like to be the strangler 
Of this punk ass little pussy's punie neck 
Its my right to insist 
That he acknowledge my existence 
But he just displays complete lack of respect 
Thats when he says to himself as he 
Uses his magazines to trash me 
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk 
Smokes a bag of his weed 
And starts imagining things 
And he just cant see that hes manically depressed 
And in his jealousy and envy 
It just whirls him in a frenzy 
As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
And he dont exist in his world 
So he just twists and he twirls 
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage 
And its destroying him slowly 
Cuz he does not even know me 
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
So he just tortures himself 
He has no fortune and wealth 
So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
And now hes acting like a bully 
So he tries to push and pull me 
But he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad 
He has no choice but to scream 
And raise his voice up at me 
Cuz it annoys him to see that I aint scared 

Chorus 
You aint no muthafuckin 
Buuully 
And I aint bowing to no muthafuckin 
Buuully 
I wont allow it, aint no coward to no 
Buuully 
Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a 
Buuully 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a 
Buuullyyyyyyyy 

And I know it must be fuckin with you emotionallyyyyyyyy 

Verse 2 
Now im not tryin to make no more enemies 
No more unfortunately 
Theres so many other muthafuckas that just are 
They just keep houndin at me 
Now that im down wit 50 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja 
But his ass is such a puppet 
Irv could shove his whole hand up it 
And just make him say what he wants him to say 
But Suge has Irv on a string 
And Irv's so nervous that he 
Says anything to this man to keep him at Bay 
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough 
And Murder INC's the big bad wolf 
And they go huff and puff 
And blow our label down 
But our buildings made out of bricks 
So you aint takin our shit 
And dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
So now you try to pull the race card 
And it backfires in your face hard 
Cuz you know we dont play that black and white shit 
Plus that stylist that you fucked 
When you was extacy'd up 
Was just a man who's dressed up 
As a white bitch 

Chorus x1 
You must be takin too much eeeeeeeeee 

Verse 3 
Now what bothers me the most 
About hip hop is we so close 
To pickin up where we left off with Big and Pac 
We just lost Jam Master Jay 
Big L got blasted away 
Plus we lost Bugs, Snake Tongue and Freaky Tah 
Its like a neverending cycle 
That just seems to come full circle 
Everybodies gotta be so fuckin hard 
And im not excluding myself 
Cuz I been stupid as well 
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
But as we grow as men we learn 
To let shit go but then again 
Theres only so much bullshit we can really stand 
We all got reps to up hold 
When someone steps on our toe 
Its no exception it goes for every man 
But if Irv really gave a fuck 
About Ja like he claims he does 
And wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
They just keep feeding him pills 
So if that E doesnt kill him 
Someone from G Unit will and I aint buzzed 
Dawg im talkin to you straight 
If the situation escalates and worse 
Were gonna lose another soldier to this game 
And if I get killed for this rap 
I got a million in cash 
That says I will get you back in Hailey's name 

Chorus x1 

Irv go get your boy up off that Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 

Get at me dawg, holla
