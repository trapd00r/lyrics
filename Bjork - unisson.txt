Send "Unison" Ringtone to your Cell One hand loves the other
So much and me

Born stubborn me
Will always be
Before you count
One two three
I will have grown my own private branch
Of this tree

You gardener
You discipliner
Domestically
I can obey all of your rules
And still be, be

I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

I thrive best hermit style
With a beard and a pipe
And a parrot on each side
But now I can't do this without you

I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

One hand loves the other
So much and me

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's
Ooohhhh ooohh
