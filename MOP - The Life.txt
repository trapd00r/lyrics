BONG! (Whoa oh oh! Demarco!) Yeah! (Yo Yo! Yeah! Yo Yo! Yeah!)
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Demarco!) M.O.! (Yo Yo! Yeah! Yo Yo! Yeah!)
BRRRRRRRRRRUUUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!

[Chorus: Demarco]
Who said life was an easy road, alot of people can't even bare my load
Hustle everyday when we touch the road, yo mi just, can't leave the streets
STREET LIFE! It give me money and my food and my bills dem paid
STREET LIFE! Now everybody calls you plus because you got shit made
STREET LIFE! Di house pon di hills wid di pool sittin unda di shade
STREET LIFE! Oh Oh the STREET LIFE! Honor that!

[Verse 1: Billy Danze]
Now you can sit around and watch it all go down around you
Or you can imitate the ways the killers and cars move
You can't simulate the days when they played by the rules
And if you wasn't in the maze you really can't drop jewels
You really can't understand, how a boy could be fooled
And when he turned twenty nine he still need to be schooled
See it's a difference in takin a stand and mannin up
As apposed to bein a man and standin up
Listen I already been there
That book of live men small section of survivors my name in there
From rollin with the riders, you couldn't pretend there
With live men beside us, we still couldn't win there
They showed us how to send there, and get the attention of the Feds
And be the stars when the eulogy is read
The way they worshipin the bread, the day is not ok
For good people that may never get ahead, let us pray

[Chorus: Demarco]
Who said life was an easy road, alot of people can't even bare my load
Hustle everyday when we touch the road, yo mi just, can't leave the streets
STREET LIFE! It give me money and my food and my bills dem paid
STREET LIFE! Now everybody calls you plus because you got shit made
STREET LIFE! Di house pon di hills wid di pool sittin unda di shade
STREET LIFE! Oh Oh the STREET LIFE! Honor that!

[Verse 2: Lil' Fame]
I live it for the homies that's gone (AND!) And the homies that's still around
The O.G.'S that did it for years career criminals
For the homies locked down since the days of a juvenile
Tryin to maintain in the game cause they just gettin out
(THEY LOST!) You got some livin in the now
You know them schisty ass individuals livin foul
He claim that he got it locked, but he still 'gon run to the store
To get a dutch for the lil' homey on the block
The game's fucked up! Shit is reversed now
The hood is lookin like the suburbs now which way is home? !
Just do what you always did or you 'gon get what you always got
Get STABBED get SHOT, the street life

[Chorus: Demarco]
Who said life was an easy road, alot of people can't even bare my load
Hustle everyday when we touch the road, yo mi just, can't leave the streets
STREET LIFE! It give me money and my food and my bills dem paid
STREET LIFE! Now everybody calls you plus because you got shit made
STREET LIFE! Di house pon di hills wid di pool sittin unda di shade
STREET LIFE! Oh Oh the STREET LIFE! Honor that!

[Outro: Demarco (Lil' Fame)]
Whoa oh oh! (M.O.! YEAH!) Yo Yo! Yeah! Yo Yo! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Demarco!
