Alright let's just go for it
C'mon baby
(C'mon baby, freaky, freaky, freaky)
One time
(Can ya feel me?)

All pretty ladies around the world
Got a beat here to show ya so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, ya sista, and your mama too
'Cuz we're about to go down and you know just what to do

Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Right by the people as they stop to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance, quick na

Now c'mon baby tell me what's the word
Word up everybody sing
When you hear that, ya gotta get it under way
Word up it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard
(Word up)

Eh, hey, yeah
(C'mon baby)
Eh, hey, yeah
Word up
Eh, hey, yeah
(Can ya feel me?)
Eh, hey, yeah

Now all you sucka DJ's who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and you know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you got to realize that you're actin' like fool

If that's music, we can use it, we're free to dance
We don't have no time for a physiological romance
No romance, no romance
A no romance for me, na

Now c'mon baby tell me what's the word
Now word up everybody sing
When you hear that call you gotta get it under way
Word up it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard
(Word up)

Word up everybody sing
When you hear that call you gotta get it under way
Word up it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard
(Word up)

Eh, hey, yeah
(C'mon baby)
Eh, hey, yeah
Word up

Can ya feel me?
(Eh, hey, yeah)
Word up
Everybody sing

Word up
It's the code word
Word up

Do you like that?
