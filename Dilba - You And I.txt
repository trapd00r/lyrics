We talk too much, got nothing really smart to say
I think a lot, but thoughts no longer make my day.

Where I sometimes, I love you baby when you play
and hurt sometimes and wait for it to go
to go away! 

chorus:
That`s lalalala life, that`s lalalala like hole in the sky!
lalalalala waist of time, if you lalalalalala lost the fight
why lalalalala waist your time, with me

From now, now on, what`s right is wrong and that`s ok
for me and you, I`m happy if you stay all day
we laugh a lot and kiss until we fall asleep
and then wake up and let the morning 
be there and stay!

chorus

I feel, if that is what you want, now keep your ring, house and the car
if this is it then it`s a lie, cause love is here for all I know
In my life!

chorus * 2

...with me, with me
