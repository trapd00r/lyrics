If there's a way that you could 
be everything you want to be, 
Would you complain that it came too easy? 
Just like the games with you and me 
A resolution hard to see, 
But that's O.K. 'cause I don't 
see things that are plain to see 
I've got a dream to take you over 
Exploding like a supernova 
I'm gonna crash into your world 
And that's no lie 

You want to give ecstacy delivered 
with certainty 
But you're afraid that the pleasure 
won't be needed 
In a way, we're the same two people 
looking out to sea 
For a wave that would carry all our 
fantasies 

If there's a way to infiltrate you 
Sway your mind and complicate you 
I'm gonna crash into your world 
And that's no lie 

Let your body move into the doorway 
To the disco inside your head (Violet) 
Wear a color that you want to cling to 
The color inside your head (Violet) 

Contemplate jealously intermixed 
with urgency 
A million things take a damned 
good shot at you and me 

If there's a way to infiltrate you 
Sway your mind and complicate you 
I'm gonna crash into your world 
And that's no lie 

Let your body move into the doorway 
To the disco inside your head (Violet) 
Wear a color that you want to cling to 
The color inside your head (Violet) 

Dance to the disco, Dance to the disco 
Dance to the disco, Dance to the disco 

I'm gonna take you 
I'll do my best to break you 
I'm gonna take you higher 
And that's no lie 

Common sense is a game many 
people don't like to play 
But give it in and the moment takes 
you either way 

I've got a dream to take you over 
Exploding like a supernova 
I'm gonna crash into your world 
And that's no lie 

Let your body move into the doorway 
To the disco inside your head (Violet) 
Wear a color that you want to cling to 
The color inside your head (Violet) 

If there's a way that you could 
be everything you want to be, 
Would you complain that it came too easy? 
In a way, we're the same two people 
looking out to sea 
For a wave that would carry all our 
fantasies
