Send "Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough" Ringtone to your Cell Now I don't wanna lose you, 
but I don't wanna use you 
just to have somebody by my side 
And I don't wanna hate you 
I don't wanna take you 
But I don't wanna be the one to cry 
That don't really matter to anyone, anymore 
But like a fool I keep losing my place 
And I keep seeing you walk through that door 

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much 
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust 
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are 
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough 

Now I could never change you 
and I don't wanna blame you 
Baby you don't have to take the fault
Yes I may have hurt you 
But I did not desert you 
Maybe I just wanna have it all 
It makes a sound like thunder 
It makes me feel like rain 
And like a fool who will never see the truth 
I keep thinking something's gonna change 

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much 
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust 
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are 
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough 

And there's no way home 
when it's late at night and you're all alone 
Are there things that you wanted to say 
Do you feel me beside you in your bed 
there beside you where I used to lay 

And there's a Danger in loving somebody too much 
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch. 
There's a reason why people don't say who they are 
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough. 
Baby sometimes love-it just ain't enough...ohh, No. No.
