Send "Like a Suicide" Ringtone to your Cell Creatin'walls, divide good from bad
Keepin'out the dirt, raising a flag
What's on the inside, and who's been locked outside?
I saw you falling like a suicide

You're televised, a faceless number
Got my ass on the first row, watching you stumble
You threw it all out, a life in black and white
I saw you falling like a suicide

Like a bullet, straight from the sky
Isolate the pain, trying to get high
Sometimes I wonder, could've seen it in your eyes?
I saw you falling like a suicide
