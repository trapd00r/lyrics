I still believe in your eyes;
I just don't care what
You've done in your life.
Baby i'll always be here by your side;
Don't leave me waiting too long,
Please come by!
I, i, i, i still believe in your eyes;
There is no choice,
I belong to your life.
Because i, i need you love you some day;
You'll be my baby
And will fly your way
And i'll fly with you,

You are, are, are, are, are, are!!!
You are, are, are, are, are, are!!!
You are, are, are, are, are, are!!!
