Send "Olé Olé" Ringtone to your Cell I'm feelin hot today 
I'm gonna make you sway 
So when I count to 4 
We're going out that door,
It's time to hit the floor! 

Olé Olé! 
Come on, let's get it started! 
Olé Olé! 
We'll never be defided 
All around the world, every boy and girl
Raise your hands and say
Olé Olé!

Remember when we sang
Just like a boomerang 
So all the girls and boys
You have to raise your voice,
It's time to make some noise! 

Olé Olé! 
Come on, let's get it started! 
Olé Olé! 
We'll never be defided 
All around the world, every boy and girl
Raise your hands and say
Olé Olé!

Olé Olé! 
Come on, let's get it started! 
Olé Olé! 
We'll never be defided 
All around the world, every boy and girl
Raise your hands and say
Olé Olé!

Go go Andrés 
Olé Olé 
Go go
