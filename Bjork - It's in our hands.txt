Look no further
Look no further
Look no further

Cruelest
Almost 
Always to ourselves
It mustn't get any better
Off

It's in our hands, it always was
It's in our hands, in our hands
It's all there, in our hands
It's all there, in our hands

Well
Aren't we scaring ourselves
Unnecessarily?
Aren't we trying too hard?

'Cause it's in our hands
It's in our hands
It's all here, it's in our hands

Look no further
Look no further

It's in our hands, it always was
It's in our hands
