All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall

Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands1
The bleeding hearts and the artists
Make their stand

And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall: after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad buggers
Wall

(Spoken) Isn't this where....2
