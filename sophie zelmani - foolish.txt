So, so say I'm foolish
Say, it's all in my mind
Don't give me right on this feeling
I did what I always do
Bad things go'way by believing

So, I was too foolish
So, I let myself down
Still this is the ground
So, I was right on this feeling
But i'll do what i've always done
Bad things are eased by believing
It was just my time to come
