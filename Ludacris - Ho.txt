(Chorus)
Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)

You doin' Hoe activities
With Hoe tendencies
Hoes are your friends, Hoes are your enemies
With Hoe energy to do what you do
Blew what cha blew, screw what cha screw
Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pulling on my coat tail
And why you think you take a Hoe to a Hoe-tel?
Hoe-tell everybody, even the mayor
Reach up in the sky for the Hoe-zone layer
Now come on player once a Hoe always 
And Hoes never close, they open like hallways
So here's the whole cake for your whole Hoe crew
And everybody wants some 'cause Hoes gotta eat too.

(Chorus)
Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)

Can't turn a Hoe into a house wife
Hoes don't act right
There's Hoe's on a mission & there's Hoes on a crack pipe
Hey Hoe, how you doin'? Where you been?
Probably doin' Hoe stuff 'cause there you Hoe again
It's a Hoe wide world, that we livin' in
Feline feminine fantastical women
Not all, just some
You Hoe who you are
There's Hoes in the room, there's Hoes in the car
There's Hoes on stage, there's Hoes by the bar
Hoes by near & Hoes by far.

Hoe.
But can I get a ride?
No
Come on nigga why?
'Cause you's a...

(Chorus)
Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)

You got a run in your pantyhose
Even your daddy knows
that you suckin' down chocolate like daddy-os
Your Hoes are Hoe-rrible, Hoe-rrendous
On taxes ya'll writin' off, Hoes as dependents
I see the Hoe-rizon, It ain't surprisin'
It's just a Hoe-asis, with ugly chicks faces
Hoes don't feel so sad & blue
'Cause most of us niggas is Hoes too.

(Chorus)
Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, (Hoe)
You's a Hoe, I said that you's a Hoe (Hoe)

(You's a Hoe)
(Muthafucker, I ain't no Hoe)
(Yo' mama a Hoe)

(Muthafuckers, I'm so tired Of ya'll niggas 
always talkin' about Hoe this & Hoe that,
You the muthafuckin' Hoe nigga, I wasn't no Hoe last night)

Hoe bring yo' ass.
(Okay hold on)
