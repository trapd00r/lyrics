Send "Following Skadi" Ringtone to your Cell Lyrics by: Astrid 
Music by: Diarmaid

The northern night’s shining by fires of enemy’s ships 
Is awakening my mind from the trance…
It’s time to remember all blood and all sorrows
And swords of my brother’s in wildest dance… 

When beauty dawn closer I’ll raising my hands
To Asgard through grey northern clouds…
My beautiful Goddess, I’m following you
Towards wars and battles and storming sea’s sounds…

In enemy’s eyes I have red a great hatred,
The revenge was flashed on the edge of my sword…
And Scadhi will wait till I’m ready to follow –
Together we’ll save our beautiful world. 

The cold wind of freedom will break off all chains,
And push in the embrace of war…
And forcing my heart to remember all names
Then Valhall will open the door…

The Child of the Will is your name I know…
All wishes and dreams in your hands.
Like you I will stand on the native land’s snow 
Protecting my dear Fatherland.

There were many battles that we had seen,
And all our foes are dead…
Now going to Valhall I’m following you 
Highly raising to stars my head…
