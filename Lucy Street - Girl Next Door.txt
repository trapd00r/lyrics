Nothing really matters
If I can't be with you now
My heart is beating faster
Tell me what to do now
Got to be better ways
Than telling to you face to face
Got to find some gravity
Before I lose my sanity

Everytime I'm around you
I never know what to say
Everytime I'm around you
You take my breath away

Come and see me
I'm the girl next door
I don't think I've ever been in love before
Come and see me
I'm the girl next door
You got my attention that's for sure
Come and show me what's more

Come and show me what's more

Time and again
I'm acting like a fool, yeah
Looking like a jerk
Trying to be cool, yeah
I'll be good, I'll be fine
If only I can make you mine
Here I go, win or lose
Do or die, got to choose
You take my breath away

Come and see me
I'm the girl next door
I don't think I've ever been in love before
Come and see me
I'm the girl next door
You got my attention that's for sure
Come and show me what's more

So come and show me what's more

Everytime I'm around you
I never know what to say
Everytime I'm around you
You take my breath away

You take my breath away, oh yeah
You take my breath away, eh eh
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

Come and see me
I'm the girl next door
I don't think I've ever been in love before
Come and see me
I'm the girl next door
You got my attention that's for sure
Come and show me what's more

(Girl next door)

Oh, baby
Come and see me
I'm the girl next door
You got my attention that's for sure
Come and show me what's more
