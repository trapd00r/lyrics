Well back in the past when I was treated so coldly
My love life was a cryin' disgrace
I needed someone to love and hold me
That's one of the reasons that I was outta place

So this is love? Well she finally kissed me
Had me all worked up inside
I was in love but cupid missed me
She up and left and I almost died

But I was young and I was far from lonely
I been that way for a long, long year
Needed a girl to call my one and only
Is that you?

You think ya got the interest?
Come on an' take the time
'Cause you know, I wanna be
Yours in a simple rhyme

Wow
Hey, hey, hey

Well ain't life grand when ya finally hit it?
I'm always a sucker for a real good time
Woke up in line, found I almost missed it
Ain't I glad that love is blind?

But I was young and I was far too crazy
Been that way for a long, long time
Needed a girl but I was just too lazy
Now that I've found you

You think ya got the interest?
Come on an' take the time
I'm gonna be yours in a simple...
Rhyme. Rhyme

And she made the mountains sing
Birds against an icy sky
And I heard bells ringin'
I think I heard an angel sigh

And she said,
"There'll be times. There will be times."

(Ah) You're gonna hear the angels singin'
(Ah) You're gonna hear the angels sing, they'll say
(Ah ah. Ah ah. Ah ah ah)
Ow

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ha, ah, yeah

You think ya got the interest
Come on an' take the time
I'm gonna be yours in a simple...
