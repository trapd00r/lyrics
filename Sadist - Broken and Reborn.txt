Send "The Tides" Ringtone to your Cell Pull
Meet me beyond the emptiness
And only then will you see
All that you have
All that you have in this world
Is all that you need
So release me into the vast unknown
For I have been reborn
Arise in tune with the tides
You wait for them to fall
On your balance, your life
And through the serpentines
You reach into the deep
And you pull
Drift and you tow
With only the moons light to guide you
Will you please
Release me into the vast unknown
For I have been reborn
Arisen in tune with the tides
You wait for them to fall on your balance, your life
And through the serpentines
You reach into the deep
And pull and release 
Be it on high relentless
Or down in the shallows
You're senseless
Release me into the vast unknown 
For I have been reborn 
Arise in tune with the tides
You wait for them to fall
On your balance your life
And through the serpentines
You reach into the deep
You pull and release
You drift and you tow
You reaped when you knew
There was nothing to sow
So welcome to a hell of an existence
If you think you can predict it
We you fool and you fake
Like it's all been arranged
And you wax and you wane
