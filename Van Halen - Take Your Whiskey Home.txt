Uh-uh 
Uh-uh-uh-uh-ah!
Well, my baby, she don't want me around
She said she's tired of watchin' me fall down (He-he-he-yuh!)
She wants a good life, ah! An' all the best
But I like that bottle better than the rest

And she said:
"I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble, ah!"
"Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble"
"Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble"
"If you take your whiskey"

Ow!

Well, that liquor in the night time leaves strange memories
Seems a lifetime, ooh, since yesterday
Come the daybreak, and come tomorrow
That woman's waited up all night for me again

Oh! She said:
"Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lotta trouble." Yeah!
"I think that you're headed for a whole lotta trouble." Oh, yeah!
"Yeah ya know that you're headed for a lotta trouble"
"If you take your whiskey home"

(Guitar Solo)

Some goes to women, ooh, some goes to Jesus
That I'm absolutely certain both's all right
Yeah, but it takes me at least halfway to the label
'Fore I can even make it through the night

Uh well, I think that you're headed for a whole lotta trouble
Yeah yeah, I think that you're headed for a whole lotta trouble
Baby, yeah, I think that you're headed for some trouble
If you take your whiskey home

(Guitar Solo)

Oh! Ooh baby, take your whiskey home, yeah!
Ooh, a la la la la la la yeah
