Send "No Water" Ringtone to your Cell no water can quench my thirst
I'm in bed
send me a nurse
I'm thirsty, thirsty
Lord have mercy

Hot are the battles, sweet the victories
I've got your love
power of your glory

can't judge a mother by looking at the father
can't judge a book by looking at the cover

you've got your love
I've got mine
put them together
they work fine

break it back
turn it loose
it doesn't matter, baby
it got to choose
 Send "No Water" Ringtone to your Cell
