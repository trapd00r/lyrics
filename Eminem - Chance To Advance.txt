Gun shots followed by screaming] 

[Proof:] 
Pow-pow! Straight off the corral 
Now, the dirtiest street vet from the mile 
Is vexed without the techs and six shooter  

 
Body bullet polluter, perverted intruder 
Now who the, fuck wanna buck with the diseased, that's dis-eased 
I got a bitch named trigger, my main-squeeze will make your brain 
freeze 
Dirty D is dope like cane 

[Eye-Kyu:] 
Remained eased, maintain chill status with no pause 
Hot slugs to your carriages, turn your dome to coleslaw 
My only thought is survival before my arrival 
I'm jumping out on niggas like I'm 5-0 
Smack 'em up like a pack of trifling fly hoes 
Any opportunity to mangle I never pass up 
Fucking your clique with broom sticks - face down, ass up 
Dirty Dozen packing the shit to turn your chest red 
With our dick in ya mouth, fucking everything you just said 

[Eminem:] 
Yeah yeah bitch, coming to a block near you is Dirty Dozen 
Nasty like a stank, slut bitch with 30 husbands 
When I was 5 I was already fuckin' 
And playing X-rated cassettes in Teddy Ruxpin 
I used to walk up and down the block cussin' 
Locked in youth homes at 6 with glocks bussin' 
I grew up with not ballers, who got dollars 
Shot callers with guns and Rotwillers 

[Bizarre:] 
By any means necessary I'm on a killing spree 
It's the devil in me, intoxicated with brown Hennessy 
Beware life ain't fair and I don't care 
Cher braids my hair while her kids are in day-care 
Two blunts and I'm out for lunch 
Your whore said I'm here "Sugar pie, honey bunch" 
This Bizarre kid, that ain't the answer 
You're more uncomfortable than an anorexic cat with fucking cancer 

[Chorus:] 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants 

[Bizarre:] 
Back from the studio boy, I don't wanna mingle 
Smoking LSD, working on Lou Roths new single 
Who's the big guy who's quick like Sugar Ray 
Fuck Calgon bitch, Bizarre might take you away 
Give up the pussy cause I know you a freak 
?? in a week, cause my kids got to eat 
Date raping anorexic girls in my beat-up car 
(Hold up Bizarre, you taking that shit too far!!!) 
but I can't stop cause my brains ain't there 

[Eminem:] 
Bust a nut then drop that bitch in Lake St. Clair 
Your mistakes ain't rare, your rap style annoys 
You rap like a bitch plus I can't stand your voice 
Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck, eat a dick 
You need a brick upside your dome, we be the clique 
Runnin' you down in carloads 
Leaving you smashed down on tar roads, flat line like barcodes 

[Eye-Kyu:] 
Put up your guard hoes, I'm blazing heat the way we speak 
Not even Nike could cover these amazing feats 
Burning rappers eternally, internally and externally 
For half stepping like one-legged fraternities 
Quickdraw McGraw, AKA Eye-Kyu 
Putting something inside you, leaving holes that I see right through 
For anyone obstructing my view, my art of attack 
Is slugs through your chest, that'll blow your heart out your back 
Making sure you get fed, with a whole lot of led 
And throw you over the Ambassador Bridge and scream "Drop Dead!" 

[Proof:] 
Largely, I'm out to stack equations, without a tax-evasion 
Make moms say "That's amazing," all the same like black and Asian 
My pack evasion, attack a stage and you blush like a Cadillac, 
I wish your fleet would try to battle rap, 
Or make a man bleed, like a cattle pack stampede 
Front and co-sign my hands leave 
Think to Recognize like Sam Sneed 
My ?? dispose ya, froze ya, another classic closure 
The death-master out to blast ya 
My team runs shit, from from the D E side, down to last ya 
Past the, norm, my crew swarm, molest the children of the corn 
Dirty D 'till infinity, now bring it on 

[Chorus:] 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants 
Here's your chance to advance 
Get in your stance I'll shot the holster off your cowboy pants
