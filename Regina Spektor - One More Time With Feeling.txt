Your stitches are all out, but your scars are healing wrong
And the helium balloon inside your room has come undone
And it's pushing up at the ceiling and the flickering lights it cannot get beyond

Oh, everyone takes turns, now it's yours to play the part
And they're sitting all around you holding copies of your chart
And the misery inside their eyes is synchronized reflecting into yours

Hold on
One more time with feeling
Try it again
Breathing's just a rhythm
Say it in your mind until you know that the words are right
This is why we fight

You thought by now you'd be so much better than you are
You thought by now they'd see that you had come so far
And the pride inside their eyes would synchronize into a love you'll never know
So much more than you can show

Hold on
One more time with feeling
Try it again
Breathing's just a rhythm
Say it in your mind until you know that the words are right
This is why we fight
This is why we fight
