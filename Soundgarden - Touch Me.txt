In the night
In the city
Alone in my room
Ooh wall to wall

[Chorus]
Touch me, can you feel it
Touch me, it feels good
Touch me, yah I can feel it
(I got the feelin');
Touch me

Couldn't get to sleep in my room last night
Somethin' isn't quite the same
Just as I was reaching for the nearest light
I heard somebody calling my name

(Chorus)

Oh yeah
All right now

Shivers down my backbone 'cause my man is back
And my pulse began to race
Oh when she layed beside me everything went black
'Cause I've seen the strangest things

(Chorus)
