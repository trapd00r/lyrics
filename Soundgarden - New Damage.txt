When new damage comes
It's a faceless poison
A new world order
It's new damage done

The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown

When new damage comes
It's a new word for plague
A new world order
A new word for hate

The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
The wreck is going down
