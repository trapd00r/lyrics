CHALI
Seldom traveled by the multitude 
The devil's gavel has a couple fooled
My culture's screwed 
Cuz this word is misconstrued
Small countries exempt from food
Cuz leaders have different views
You choose

AKIL
What mean the world to me is being free
Live and let live and just let it be
(Let it be)
Love peace and harmony
One universal family 
One god, one aim, & one destiny

MARC 7
O yea?
Imagine life without a choice at all
Given a vote without a voice at all
These be the problems that we face
I'm talkin' poverty and race
But no matter what the case we gotta

CHORUS
Hold on to this feeling
FREEDOM
FREEDOM
Hold on to this feeling
FREEDOM
FREEDOM

SOUP
I'm the first candidate to hate
Had to beat on the drum to communicate
For what was to come to those who were hung
They would decapitate the tongue 
If you would mention the word
FREEDOM

CHALI
Got people screamin free Mumia Jamal
But 2 out of 3 of y'all will probably be at the mall
I'm heated with y'all
The defeated will fall
Incomplete & Unsolved 
When the word freedom's involved

AKIL
My forefathers hung in trees to be free
Got rid of slavery but still kept the penitentiary
And new freedom got a shotgun
And shells with your name 
Release the hot ones
And let freedom reign

SOUP
I'm a former boat prisoner
Hollywood visitor
Dance for cats segregated on wax
My color got me handy
Cap Amos and Andy
For the freedom 
They just won't hand me

CHORUS

MARC 7 
Cuz there's not a lot of time
Your heart, body, soul and your mind
It's so true it ain't been heard in so long
That's the reason why we name this song

CHORUS

MARC 7
Cuz there's not a lot of time
Your heart, body, soul and your mind
It's so true it ain't been heard in so long
That's the reason why we name this song
