Send "Looking at You" Ringtone to your Cell When it happened 
something snapped inside 
made me want to hide 
all alone on my own 
all alone on my own 
I stood up on the stand 
with my eyes shut tight 
didnÂ´t want to see anbody 
feeling happy
having a good time, now hey 
doing alright doing alright, 
doing alright doing alright

Looked hard into the dancing crowd 
felt like screaming out loud 
I saw you standing in there 
I saw your long 
saw your long hair
opened up my eyes, baby 
you made me
realize all I want to do 
all I want to do now, girl 
is look at you looking at you baby,
look at you, looking at you baby 
yeah, yeah, hey 

Looked hard into the dancing crowd 
I felt like screaming out loud
all I wanna do all I wanna do
all I want to do
is look at you looking at you, baby

looking at you looking
