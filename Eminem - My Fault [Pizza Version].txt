I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

(Eminem)
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved (whistle)
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here" *knocks on the door*
"Who's in the den?"
(R) "It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad, (sorry) let's try another room"
(S) "I don't trust you!"
"Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods
(S) "Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party's so drag"
"Oh, dag! I didnt mean for you to eat the whole bag!" (Huh?!)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
(I'm sorry!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

Yo Sue
(S) "Get away from me! I dont know you"
Oh shoot, she's tripping
(S) "I need to go puke"
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying I dont hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
She said (S) "Help me, Slim, I think I'm having a seizure!"
I said "I'm high too bitch, quit grabbing my t-shirt! (let go)
Will you calm down, Sue?  You're starting to scare me."
She said (S) "I'm 26 years old and I'm not married!
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook!"
I'm over here Sue, you're talking to the plant look
We need to get to a hospital before it's too late
Cause I never seen no one eat as many shrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
(It was an accident!)
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

Susan (wait) where you going, you better be careful
(S) "Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled!"
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors before you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill baby please
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
John where's Dave at before I bash you
(J) "He's in the bathroom, I think he's taking a crap dude!"
Dave pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, chopping her hair off
And theres only two days left of spring break,
how long does it take for these things to wear off?
(D) "Well it depends on how many you had"
I took 3, she eat the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol
(D) "She's gonna die, dude!"
I know and it's my fault (My God!)

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
(I'm sorry!)
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
(What did I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
but now you're sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My god, I'm so sorry!  I'm so SORRY!
Susan, please wake up!
Please!  Please WAKE UP!  What are you doing?
You're not dead!  You're not dead!
I know you're not dead...
Wake up...
Susan, wake up...
Oh, my God......
