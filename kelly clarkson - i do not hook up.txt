Oh, sweetheart put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion sparks, you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys, oh, yes they will
They don't wanna define it

Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat as I kiss your forehead
This may not last but this is now, so love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand and your heart on your sleeve

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over with the snap of your finger

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand and your heart on your sleeve

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart put the bottle down 'cause you don't wanna miss out
