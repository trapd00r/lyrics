Like I love the rhythm, like the rhythm alive
Like the trouble makin' rocker from nine to five
And I can turn you wicked, and after the court
It's been ajourned, I got a lot to learn

I get extatic, need the gatic
I'm still romantic, if only you discover this full time fanatic
You give it up, give, give, give, it up
If only we're together we can reach the top

Everybody wants you
Say everybody wants your lovin'
I just like to make you mine
Mihine, yeah

Baby, give it, can you give it, give it up
Come on, baby, I need your love (Baby, give it up!)
Give it up, some of your love
Come on and play the game of love (Baby, give it up!)

Everybody feels the need to give it up
Come on, baby, I need your love (Baby, give it up!)
Can I touch you, can I love you?
Come on, baby, baby, I love you (Baby, give it up!)
