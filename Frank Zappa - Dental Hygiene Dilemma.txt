Jeff Simmons:
Man! This stuff is great! It's just as if Donovan himself had appeared on my very own TV with words of peace, love, and eternal cosmic wisdom. Leading me. Guiding me. On paths of everlasting pseudo-karmic negligence, in the very midst of my drug-induced nocturnal emission.

Good conscience:
I am your good conscience, Jeff. I know all. I see all. I am a cosmic love pulse matrix, becoming a technicolor interpositive.

Jeff Simmons:
Hmm? Where'd you buy that incense? It's hip.

Good conscience:
It's the same mysterious exotic oriental fragrance as what the Beatles get off on.

Jeff Simmons:
I thought I recognized it. Mmm, what is that, musk? 

Good conscience:
Jeff, I know what's good for you.

Jeff Simmons:
Right. You're heavy.

Good conscience:
Yes Jeff, I am your guiding light. Listen to me. Don't rip off the towels, Jeff!

Bad conscience:
Piss off, you little nitwit.

Jeff Simmons:
Hey man, what's the deal? 

Good conscience:
Don't listen to him Jeff, he's no good. He'll make you do bad things!

Jeff Simmons:
You mean ... he'll make me sin? 

Good conscience:
Yes, Jeff. Sin!

Jeff Simmons:
Wow!

Bad conscience:
Jeff, I'd like to have a word with you. About your soul.

Good conscience:
No, don't listen Jeff!

Bad conscience:
Why are you wasting your life, night after night playing this comedy music? 

Jeff Simmons:
You're right, I'm too heavy to be in this group.

Bad conscience:
Comedy music.

Good conscience:
Jeff, your soul!

Jeff Simmons:
In this group, all I ever get to do is play Zappa's comedy music. He eats!

Good conscience:
Jeff!

Jeff Simmons:
I get so tense.

Bad conscience:
Of course you do my boy.

Jeff Simmons:
The stuff he makes me do is always off the wall.

Bad conscience:
That's why it would be best to leave his stern employ.

Jeff Simmons:
And quit the group!

Bad conscience:
You'll make it big!

Jeff Simmons:
That's right.

Bad conscience:
Of course!

Jeff Simmons:
And then I won't be small! Heh-heh-heh-heh!

Ahmet Ertegun used this towel as a bathmat six weeks ago at a rancid motel in Orlando, Florida, with the highest mildew rating of any commercial lodging facility within the territorial limits of the United States, naturally excluding tropical possessions. [sniffs] Urh-urh-urh! It's still damp. What an aroma! This is the best I ever got off! What can I say about this elixir? Try it on steaks! Cleans nylons! Small-craft warnings! It's made for the home! the office! on fruits!

Bad conscience:
This is the real you, Jeff. Rip off a few more ashtrays. Get rid of some of that inner tension. Quit the comedy group! Get your own group together. Heavy! Like Grand Funk, or Black Sabbath.

Good conscience:
No, Jeff...

Jeff Simmons:
Or Coven!

Good conscience:
Peace... Love...

Bad conscience:
Bollocks.

Jeff Simmons:
What can I say about this elixir? 

Mark Volman:
Jeff has gone out there on that stuff!

Good conscience:
He should have never have used the elixir and only stuck to the incense. O Atlantis!

Mark Volman:
That was Billy the Mountain, dressed up like Donovan, fading out on the wall-mounted TV screen. Jeff is flipping out. Road fatigue! We've got to get him back to normal before Zappa finds out, steals it, and makes him do it in the movie.

Bad conscience:
You have a brilliant career ahead of you my boy. Just get out of this group!

Mark Volman:
Howard, that was Studebacher Hoch, dressed up like Jim Pons, giving career guidance to the bass player of a rock-oriented comedy group. Jeff's imagination has gone beyond the fringe of audience comprehension.

Howard Kaylan:
Jeff, Jeff it's me! The Phlorescent Leech!

Mark Volman:
Jeff, Jeff it's me! Eddie!

Mark Volman & Howard Kaylan:
Wowwww! what can I say about this elixir?
