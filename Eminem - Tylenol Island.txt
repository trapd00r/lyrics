Slim mother fuckin shady....alright 
missy elliot, Timbo, c'mon, yo 

Verse 1: 

I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends 
holdin a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends 
sprayin techs at you 
untill u see the fuckin legs full of bullets holes and the exit wounds layin next to you. 
fuckin mad dog, foamin out the mouth 
fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin out the couch 
jumped outta a 93 floor of a buildin 
and shot every window out on the way to the ground(keep filmin) 
woke up to a hospital staff 
got up and laughed 
chopped em in half 
and sufficated your oxygen mask 
if i get any higher ima get the east and west beefin again 
fly back to detroit and stand in the cross-fire 

(Ken Kaniff's voice) oh fuck...oh shit 
i got the hotel room ready 
what time are you gettin off.....work 
or shall i say 
what time are you comin over 

Verse 2: 

yo, yo, im only smilin when im violent, 
got on the plane wylin, 
told the piolet to fly me to tylenol Island 
stewardess like "you restless?" 
"no bitch, im rest-Full, so hold this fuckin jet still so i can eat this pretzels" 
Forget school, 
the other kids are disrespectfull, 
they hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles 
i can't take it 
i'm tryin to gain weight, 
so i eat steak 
and swallow the whole plate 
and weigh myself, naked 
without albulms 
to teach kids family values 
cuz every mom and dad should allo you to pop vaiulums 
and never hit sum 1 unless you got a reason 
and if there ain't a reason 
make 1 up and just start swingin
