Load up on guns and bring your friends, it's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self assured, oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, hello? 
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low? 
Hello, hello, hello!

With the lights out, it's less dangerous, here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious, here we are now, entertain us 
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yay! Yay! Yay!

I'm worse at what I do best and for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been and always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, how low? 
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low? 
Hello, hello, hello!

With the lights out, it's less dangerous, here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious, here we are now, entertain us 
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yay! Yay! Yay!

And I forget just why I taste, oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile 
I found it hard, it's hard to find, oh well, whatever, never mind 
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low? 
Hello, hello, hello!

With the lights out, it's less dangerous, here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious, here we are now, entertain us 
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
A denial! A denial! A denial! A denial!
A denial! A denial! A denial! A denial! A denial!
