It's only now when words are said
That break my heart in two,
I wonder how you can endure
All I've said, all I say to you.

How strong, how brave, how true of you
To bear the hurt I gave.
I know it tears your heart in two,
All I've said, all I say to you.

After all the words are said,
After all the dreams we made,
Every one a precious one,
Every one a summer sun

A moment lost, forever gone,
Can never be again,
So know how much it means to me;
All you said,
All you gave,
All your love to me.
