Send "I Can Feel You" Ringtone to your Cell I can feel the summer slowly
Turning into fall once more, my friend
I can read the signs of changes
Though everything repeats 'round here again
There's noting new, nothing ever ends
Though time is through, rules bend

So I can feel you, feel the diffrence that you make
Feel you when the morning breaks
Hear your voice in tune and soon
You will heal me, heal me like you used to do
Right the wrongs and see this through
Appear once more again, my friend, I can feel you

Seems like every day that passes
Sweeps away the past and all I knew
And the things that used to matter
Are worthless in comparison to you
And all there is
Now when all is through, are things I miss about you

But I can feel you, feel the diffrence that you make
Feel you when the morning breaks
Hear your voice in tune and soon
You will heal me, heal me like you used to do
Right the wrongs and see this through
Appear once more again, my friend, I can feel you

Even though you're not around
I still feel your presence in every sound, I do, I do
And although I get lost in all that's been
This words are for you, and for me to sing
It's true, it's true

Oh I can feel you, feel the diffrence that you make
Feel you when the morning breaks
Hear your voice in tune and soon
You will heal me, heal me like you used to do
Right the wrongs and see this through
Appear once more again, my friend, I can feel you
