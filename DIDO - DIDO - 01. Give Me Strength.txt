Looking at a place that's gone
Boarded up my memories 
But something's drawn me here again and I
I cannot leave the past alone
Hoped that I would never find 
All the shit I left behind
Now I find the child in me is going to remind me that I
I can't forget my past for long/so take a look outside yourself 
And tell me what you see
I can't believe 
That you won't see the change in me
Give me strength to find the road that's lost in me
Give me time to heal and build myself a dream
Give me eyes to see the world surrounding me
Give me strength to be only me
I don't want to hear the things 
You say you know all you've redeemed 
'Cause I can't change what's come before 
Build myself some better dreams 
And cast off the fear that holds me here
So take a look outside yourself 
And tell me what you see
I can't believe 
That you won't see the change in me
Give me strength to find the road that's lost in me
Give me time to heal and build myself a dream
Give me eyes to see the world surrounding me
Give me strength to be only me
