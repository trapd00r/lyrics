I look at you, it hurts, I can't deny that
It makes all the blood and bones melt right out of
My knees when you speak, a picture so perfect
It's framed with the moon, your face and eucalyptus trees

All of the streetlights are broken tonight
All of the streetlights are broken, they're broken
All of the streetlights are broken tonight
All of the streetlights are broken, I'm broken down

So let me go with you
I get through days finding ways to feel alright
Be the tape and glue that holds me up
Want to know where you go when you're not

Lighting up the night
Taking lows to drunken heights
I can't go home

I grin a crescent moon, it lights the road in
A dead valley town, you say can't imagine
My days playing out here, lawns are so perfect
But you'd be amazed, you can end up here lots of ways

So let me go with you
I get through days finding ways to feel alright
Be the tape and glue that holds me up
Settled in, poured our hearts out on the floor

Sat on 10th and Grand
I saw a bum leaning up against a door
As we passed him by, my only thought
Could be you, could be me, we've still got time

April 1
And the ground has just thawed out
The white got black
I pray for rain and an end to March's drought

Tell the ceiling cracks, we're the same, we got tired of fighting
Slept it off and I woke up writing
Places I've been, the people I've known
Capped the pen, grabbed my bag, and headed home

Bottle days so they spill out into night
Scattered thoughts on a page, polluting white
I find myself in the kitchen, aim for a couple barks that bite
I scratched your name but nothing came
