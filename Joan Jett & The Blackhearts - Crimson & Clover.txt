Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I can love her
Crimson and clover

Ah, now when she comes walkin' over
Now I've been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over

Yeah, if I'm not such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feelin'
Crimson and clover
Over and over

Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
