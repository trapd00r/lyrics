Take my faith with an open hand and warm embrace
My confidant
Use my words
Take the good away and leave the worst to sell me out

Little lies
Little lies
Making up tragedies
Nothing is what it seems
Who cares what is real
Little lies
Little lies
Only to entertain
The message is the same for those who believe

Feed the flames
Empty wishes with no room to blame
My sacrifice
Deep inside
There is nothing left to stand behind
But

Little lies
Little lies
Making up tragedies
Nothing is what it seems
Who cares what is real
Little lies
Little lies
Only to entertain
The message is the same for those who believe

Little Lies
Little lies
Nothing is what it seems
