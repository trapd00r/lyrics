If you're not ready
You'd better get yourself together

Seperate the good stuff from the junk
And then I bang, bang, the bump, the bump girl
My name is Apples and I rock your world
Worldwide, do your math

I hope that you will realize
I got the hazel eyes that make you nitrified
Step in the back and step to the front
Come alive ya'll I'll give you what you want
The rhymes I got plenty, degrees 120
And if you want some then jump the fuck in it
