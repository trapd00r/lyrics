(Verse 1 - Obie Trice)

Baby im feeling the feelings you givin', Im feelin your style
N' im willing to let my guard down to figure u out
Im picturin your figure in a swimsuit whilin
Somewhere in the carribean islands
Cuz the vibe you giving me now
Feels like im a innocent child
A sinner whose never tempted when other womens around
Hands down this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
wen a niggas diggin u out
the phone ring
u cuss them motherfuckers out
quit calling the house
if i call u and rout
its a drout u look out
im on edge u put the palm of ur hand on my head and squeeze
please believe i aint scared of commitment
fuck head from them bitches
wen u could do the same
but that respect is givin
our intimacy is significantly different

(Chorus - Eminem)

you gon' ride for me
then im gon ride for u
if u put ur mouth on me
imma put my mouth on u

together there aint nothing we cant do
any problem we can see it through
baby if you promise to be true
i will never put my hands on u
come on and think about it

(Verse 2 - Obie Trice)

We aint gotta talk wen we see eachother
We got it all chummed out wen we see eachother under them covers
You my lover, im your friend, im your man, but im sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
visions of u havin my little man
we joke, u call me george foreman
cuz im namin him o numba fo', me im three
cuss the ol' g like the personality she ses not to be
im in the bathroom wen you pee
she in the bathroom too wen a nigga doo-doo, u my boo-boo
theres nothing in this world a nigga wouldnt do to satisfy
dis my bitch that ride
my bitch wit the pistol in the ride
a nigga act up, she bustin, she aint got to decide, no discussion
she put a slug in a tough niggas muffin, u fucken wit her husband

(Chorus - Eminem)

(Verse 3 - Obie Trice)

Come and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between
or intervine our bondage
Drama, we overcome it if we out numbered
i promise itll be us against a hundred
rushing to ur side wen u vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
8 months later obie rubbin ur stomach
payin homage to ur momma for raisin a girl proper
enuf to call o her baby father
u aint gotta bother bout a deal, i swear i keep it real
Raise young o(?) and cook a decent meal
its signed and sealed, u the only female
hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
post bail and post up for sale, i swore
i swear we will always live well
long as i got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
who gon' stop up, nobody, we's that deal

(Chorus - Eminem)

(Verse 4 - Eminem)

if u gon' stand by me
then im gon' stand by u
if u promise ull be true
then ill never put my hands on u

dont u play me for no fool
cuz if i put my mouth on u
after u put ur mouth on someone else
better find someone else new
come on and think about it
