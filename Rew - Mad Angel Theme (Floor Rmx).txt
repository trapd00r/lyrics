You won't hold me, hold me down
You won't break this heart
I will be free again

Stone cold night on a cold stone floor
A cluster of lights on the prison door
I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day

I will begin again
I will begin again

Oh, I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day
On New Year's day
